It seemed at first this would be an epic clash of big men but the match does not last long at all. Yoko gains the upper hand at first landing his leg drop but once he goes for his finish Diesel moves and scores the pin fall.2.[I-C TITLE]RAZOR RAMON VS GOLDUST-this is actually a very good match from the 1996 Royal Rumble event in which Goldust really shined. The match was a nice back and forth with Dust in his prime and playing all kinds of mind games. Ramon was more of the brawler laying into Goldust with punches and power moves. Goldust held his own in the brawl department but used various different types' tactics against Razor. After a good match Dust wins the I-C title.3.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP]BRET HART VS THE BRITISH BULLDOG-this match was from In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings and really is a classic in my opinion. The match is a back and forth with Bulldog putting a beating on Bret and busting him open. But Bret was excellent in this match like he always is pushed through even getting a "he's hardcore" from some of the ECW fans in attendance that night. Bret would keep his title in a hard fought classic.4.UNDERTAKER VS ISAAC YANKAM-this was a match between the two future Brothers of Destruction that took place on Monday Night Raw. At the time Isaac was Jerry Lawler's number one guy and it showed during the match as The King interfered and tried to take the urn. Taker dominates the pre Kane Yankam here but still an entertaining match. This was during the time Taker wore that creepy mask, still cool to this day.5.BRET HART, SAVIO VEGA, RAZOR RAMON VS OWEN HART, YOKOZUNA, HAKUSHI-this is another exclusive for the tape and what a great match it is. At the time these six were six of the biggest heels and faces in the WWF. The action in this one is very fast paced with a lot of offense from both sides. There are a lot of near falls but the finish is really well done, Savio gets the pin over Hakushi. But the way it was done was brilliant.This was a good collection matches and back then it was a really good purchase, also after the tape there is a thing about moves and such you can do on the WWF Wrestlemania game.
