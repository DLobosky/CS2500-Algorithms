The storyline to Takers is not very original and reminded me of some previous similar movies like, 'Heat' or 'Set it Off" from the 90's, yet it is entertaining and interesting.  Never got lost or bored during the film and kept my attention well from beginning to end.  The ending was so so I thought and could have maybe been a little better.  Don't think I have seen a movie with Matt Dillon in it that I have not liked.  Overall if you like crime/mystery type films should be worth one viewing.Peter J.
