She was a super-extrovert to the tee.  If she ever stayed home even one night in her adult life to curl up with a good book, I would be most surprised.  She was a people animal, loved society (especially that of film and stage personalities and her democratic political allies, although she did remain close lifelong to some of her schoolgirl friends) and needed to be out in it.  She seemed to make people feel happy, as is reflected in the faces of those with her in the many photographs provided.The book is extremely well written, and captures Ms. Loy's voice although she had a co-writer, James Kotsilibas-Davis, chip in.  From her girlhood in Montana (Gary Cooper lived on the same block) to an eventual move to the sunshine state, where in her late teens she began a film career, on to stardom and political activism, her move in later years to NYC, her two mastectomies late in life, her many marriages, and her friendships and acquaintances with almost all of the major Hollywood stars, what could not be interesting about this book, if one is a Myrna Loy fan, that is.And who after viewing The Thin Man flicks, or one of the greatest screwball comedies of all time, I Love You Again with William Powell (can you think of a greater screen duo, possibly with the exception of Rogers and Astaire?), could fail to be a fan of Myrna Loy.We get to meet all the Hollywood notables here, and the major political figures of the time as well.  Eleanor Roosevelt often called for Ms. Loy's assistance and support as she worked indefatigably for social causes.  We live through their sorrows, such as the untimely death of Carole Lombard [both her present husband, Clark Gable, and her former husband, William Powell (they always remained friends), attended her funeral, as did Ms. Loy, although Clark Gable was not able to speak to anyone because of his deep grief].She gives her honest opinion of everyone who made up her world.  She doesn't make anyone pretty when they were not and, although she never gets too harsh on anyone, she spares no punches in her opinion of Christina Crawford, Joan's daughter, who wrote that dreadful book that the American public never seemed to question.  Joan Crawford was a decades-long friend of Myrna Loy, and they had true admiration and liking for each other.  I personally can testify to the veracity of Myrna Loy's statements regarding Christina.  In fact, she was too soft on her.  I was a schoolmate of hers and witnessed myself the actions and behavior of a person not self-depicted in her vilifying book.Myra Loy's marriages were a mess.  The great love of her life was her first husband (though he seemed to take forever getting around to marrying her, and through the waiting process she even had an abortion), the producer Arthur Hornblow.  To say he was controlling is an understatement.  He wouldn't even let her family members come to their home.  Her second husband had mental problems and beat her up.  Gene Markey, her third and Joan Bennett's ex, was an incurable philanderer (when they visited London, he even stashed his mistress at the same hotel, and requested hotel staff not to reveal her presence to his wife, Myrna (thank goodness she found out anyway, which was the final coup de grâce to their marriage).  And the last, a national political figure, probably just got tired of not having a wife who prepared dinner for him each night at home and had his slippers ready and waiting (and let's not forget that before-dinner martini, not too wet and with an olive!).  At the time, Ms. Loy was not only busy with her film career, but traveling a lot speaking at political events.  Following the divorce, she threw in the towel, although she admits that you never stop getting crushes no matter how old you are.It's a good read and, if you are a Myrna Loy fan, or just interested in old Hollywood, this book won't let you down.
