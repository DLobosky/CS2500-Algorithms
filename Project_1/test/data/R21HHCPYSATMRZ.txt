The half-circle shape of the bottom of it is AWESOME!  It cradles your head in such a way that it really helps support your neck, and was very comfortable to sleep on either my back or side.  At first, I hated how firm the pillow was, but once I got used to it, now I hate soft, squishy pillows, that don't give any support.The only thing I didn't like about the pillow is the raised part at the top.  I wish it were more like a wedge, to really tilt the head back, and keep the airways more open.  Honestly, I have no idea if it helped my snoring any.  (I normally sleep alone, and only bought the pillow because a friend of mine was staying with me and complained of my snoring.)I really did like this pillow, and miss using it.  Unfortunately, after only about 3-4 months of use, it is squished down, flatter than a pancake.  I don't know what happened!  It's not like I was driving over it with a truck or anything.  So I probably won't buy this particular pillow again, since I can't afford to replace my pillow every 2 months, but I sure do miss it.
