The question was, what scheme would it be this time? Sinestro had traditionally been portrayed as cackling, two-dimensional lone wolf. But "Rebirth" presented a new take on the character, a cold, emotionless foe obsessed with maintaining order through fear.  What could he now be capable of? The answer finally came in "Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War - Volume 1".The story immediately follows the events of "Green Lantern:  Wanted - Hal Jordan" and "Green Lantern Corps: The Dark Side of Green".  Sinestro has finally resurfaced and he's not alone. The ex-Green Lantern has assembled his own crew, an army of fear mongers armed with yellow power rings. The GLC finds itself now arrayed against an alliance of their deadliest adversaries. But as the Corps fights for its survival, the greater danger may lie in elsewhere and from the least likely of places...Johns and Gibbons bring subplots from both their books to a head. "Rebirth" artist Ethan Van Sciver returns for the prologue and Ivan Reis, Patrick Gleason, and others offer a bloody, detailed look at this intergalactic conflict.
