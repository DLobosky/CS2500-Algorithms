I consider Michael Mann's 1992 version of "The Last of the Mohicans" to be a great movie, and one of the best date movies of all time.  You think I am kidding?  Find a better combination of action and romance that this film.  Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) runs through the forest with an intensity that is frightening and when he finally gets tired of just looking at Miss Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), he does not need words, just the sound of a fiddle being filled in by a string section.  That is why I can also say try to find a movie with better music for both the action and the romance (I figured out how to play the main theme on a cheap mini-organ).  But I will not belabor the point because I have to think I am preaching to the choir when it comes to speaking of the quality of this film (Just avoid the book, because I could not get halfway through Cooper's novel).But this Special Edition DVD is a disgrace and the fact that here we are more than a half a decade latter since this DVD came out and we still do not have something worthy of this film.  This DVD loses one star right off the bat because here is what it describes as being "BONUS FEATURES": widescreen format, scene selection, and subtitles.  Excuse me for living, but I would consider those standard.  I have a DVD of "Zulu" that has all of those things (albeit only four chapters) and still has biographies to read.  The standard for special editions has been set by James Cameron, first with "The Abyss" (on Laser Disc originally) and then on "T2." Just look at what ever DVD you think gives you everything you want and more about a favorite movie and compare it to this barren effort.This DVD loses a second star because what has been added to the film as part of the "Director's Expanded Edition" actually takes away from the film.  To tell you the truth, I did not think that was possible.  But the scenes that are added to the film do not add anything significant. They come across as padding rather than adding depth, so just make them deleted scenes.  But even worse, there are a couple of well remembered scenes for which the music and editing have been changed to the point that the scenes are just not the same.  Even my kids picked up on this (we still have the laser disc).  There are few films I have enjoyed more than "Last of the Mohicans," but it is currently the most disappointing DVD in my collection because I know what it should be.The one strength of this disc is that the screen ratio is back to the original, which is NOT TRUE about the Laser Disc or the Widescreen Video Tape. For proof look at just one scene, the one where the British leave the fort and get attacked on both sides by the Magua's warriors. When I saw the film in the theater it was this scene that made me immediately think: "They HAVE to do this widescreen. Anything else destroys the film." I remember that Cora and her sister rode their horse over to a tree on the right, got off, and hid behind it. On the VHS and the Laser Disc I could not see that. I thought I was crazy and had imagined that part of the action, but when the movie aired on TV the scan and pan caught the scene. So the good news is that on this DVD you can see everything.If you loved this movie, by all means, rent the DVD and check it out.  But be prepared to be disappointed.  I watched the movie again and there are still scenes I love, but then one of those "expanded" moments comes along and it makes me want to cry.  I have been waiting this entire century for them to go back and juice up this DVD as Cameron finally did with "Titanic."  I want a DVD edition worthy of this film and my patience will run out by the end of this decade.
