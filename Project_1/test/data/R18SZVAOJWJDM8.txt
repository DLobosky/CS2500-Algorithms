Anyone who is interested in the Bushido or any martial arts should read this book!  Once again, Thomas Cleary does an excellent job of translating the essence of one of the classics of Feudal Japan.One word of advice I would give to readers is to read this book slowly.  The depth of the book's passages far outweigh their length.  I've found it best to read a passage and reflect on it in my everyday life before continuing to the next passage.Overall, this is a tremendous book that continues to have a great impact on how I go about my martial arts training, and my daily activities.  After all, the martial way isn't just for the training hall and the dojo.
