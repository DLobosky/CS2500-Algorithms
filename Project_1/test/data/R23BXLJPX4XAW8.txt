Unfortunately, there is a new gang of terrorists on the way, & no, Hans Gruber has not been ressurrected. This time, the gang is led by a stronger, meaner, better leader by the name of Col. Stuart. Soon, John encounters terrorists, who he caps one of two before Stuart finds out about him. Then John tries to inform the other police, but gets turned down by the leader even though the others believe him. Soon, Col. Stuart is demanding goods for himself and his gang, and he even shows he isn't bluffing by using a special bomb to blow up an ENTIRE IRISH PLANE full of people! NOBODY IN THE PLANE SURVIVES! If that's not evil, I don't know what is! Soon, John is fighting more terrorists, while a different plane, the one his wife is in, is not by any means destroyed, but is by all means in great peril, for Stuart's big team of terrorists has planted some sort of nasty device in it. Anyway, very soon all the other police find a way to help John and he teams up with them. They go outside and manage to get quite a few terrorists, but the remainder, including Stuart, get on a plane of their own and take off. Fortunately, John and his team are in a helicopter and therefore are able to help John get on the plane's wing. A large terrorist, one who wants John's blood as much as the big guy in the first one, volunteers to take him out. Stuart allows him, and he steps onto the wing and goes back and fourth with John until he seems to be the victor. John is resourceful just like the first movie, though. He  kicks the big bad guy into the propellor of the plane's wing, where he is chopped to pieces. Then John must face Stuart himself, who does even better than his henchman. He and John trade blows and then he pounds on him and knocks the unfortunate John off the plane. It seems like the terrorist will get away, but John has a lighter, finds a stream of fuel, and ignites it. As John says the immortal quote "Aloha, motherf**ker!" the fire catches up to the plane and Stuart, the terrorist gang and all other baddies on it are blown up and destroyed, as is the plane itself. The plane that John's wife is in has just landed by now and his wife gets off. They hug & love all over, and then after funny lines the movie ends. This is even better than the first Die Hard(which still was terrific)and if you like Bruce Willis, action/crime movies or anything with blood and fire, I recommend this movie to you, especially if you're between the age of 17 and 31. Believe me, you have to be crazy not to love this film.
