It's comfortable, sensitive, and has enough buttons to allow the important functions without being confusing.  When I bought this mouse I didn't really expect it to last long.  Says something for Logitech I suppose.This mouse isn't available anymore, but the more or less identical MX518 is still produced (Logitech MX 518 High Performance Optical Gaming Mouse (Metal)) and I recommend it for someone looking for a good mouse without breaking the bank.
