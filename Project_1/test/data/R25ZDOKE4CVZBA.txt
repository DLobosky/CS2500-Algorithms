BloodRayne is a great movie for a true fan.I am one of the biggest BloodRayne fans in the world having both video games,all three movies, and a tattoo a BloodRayne on my back.Even after all the so-called flaws  this is still a good movie overall.BloodRayne is played by Kristanna Locken which is sexy as hell with a body that will send your heart pounding.Rayne is half-vampire half-human with the abilities of both that she uses to combat her father and his vampire army.Rayne meets up with some resistance fighters that help her out in her journey.There is plenty of blood,gore,and some nudity that will please any fan.Rayne has a sex scene where she has her way with one of the resistance fighters against the cell bars and she shows some of the best cleavege you will ever see.The special effects are lacking to where I can see people making this a B movie,but if you are a true fan you will take the good with the bad and love seeing Rayne slicing vampires into body parts while looking stunning in a black&red leather outfit that is as realistic as the video game.Bottom line BloodRayne Rocks!!!
