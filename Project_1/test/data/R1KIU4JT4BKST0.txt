For some unknown reason amazon is selling this calendar on two product pages. On this page it is listed as a Mini Calendar and on the other as a 'small' calendar.  For anyone who is looking for a calendar, this is your standard mini calendar, 6.5 inches wide and 6 inches long.  It is the standard layout with the photo on the top page and the month displayed below.  The space allocated for each day is just about 3/4 of an inch square, which isn't room to much of anything.  It is sold as a 16 month calendar but the reality is that the last four months of 2011 are displayed together on the same page so there is basically only enough room to make a check mark or an X in the box.If you're like me, most people don't purchase mini calendar's to record events or appointments.  I just wanted something small on the wall near my desk whenever I needed to refer to a specific day or date.  I bought this, as usual, for photos of the people who filled the past few years with delight and magic...as such, this does not disappoint.  The photos on the pages appear to be stills from the movie.  It is a small calendar so you don't get everyone but in addition to Harry, Ron and Hermoine you also have Luna, her dad, Snape, Valdamort and Bellatrix LaStrange.  There is even a photo of the Malfoy family.  If you aren't a die hard fan of the series you might not recognize every photo because, for some odd reason, they don't identify any of the characters.  Bottom line, it is what it is.  Just a mini calendar, part of the Harry Potter phenom.  Do I believe it is the best they've ever produced?  No, not even close but the shots are clear and crisp and enough of my favorites to make me happy.  Since the last movie has now rolled out onto DVD, I have to believe this will be the last year I will be looking up at my old favorites so I'm glad I was able to get a copy.
