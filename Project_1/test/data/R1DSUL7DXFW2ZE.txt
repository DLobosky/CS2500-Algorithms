Hercules Season 4 delivered once again with its thrilling episodes. In this season, Hercules returned with his best friend, Iolaus, to face new characters and greater obstacles. For a change, humor was a major element in the adventures of Hercules and Iolaus. The audience is taken on a journey of fun and wild adventures with the main characters.The adventure began with "Jack and the Beanstalk," in which the writers brought an updated version with its usual wacky humor. In this episode, Hercules and Autolycus, The King of Thieves (Bruce Campbell), paired up to fulfill the request of an old woman. Autolycus brought a lot to this episode and allowed Hercules to play off him.The myths and legends of Hercules also took a new twist with, "Yes Virginia, There is a Hercules" which again was a very humorous episode. The script was well written and will surely leave the audience with enough suspense to keep on watching to see how the following episodes develop.In "Stranger in a Strange World," Ares and Hercules fought as Zeus interceded to stop them by throwing a powerful series of lightning bolts that open a dimensional rift to a parallel universe where all the characters have doppelgangers to the usual universe. This was one of those episodes that were designed to be a comedy, but had serious overtones. The audience is treated to some familiar characters and exciting plot lines.In "Porkules," the writers drew their ideas from the movie Babe. Autolycus stole the magic bow of Artemis and it fell into the hands of Discord, who promptly changed Hercules into a pig. Then Autolycus and Iolaus fought to save the day with hilarious results. I enjoyed watching more of Bruce Campbell as his spiced up the episode with even more humor!The season ended with "Reunions" as Hercules decided to accept the offer and managed to help some people before Zeus's true motivations became clear. Hera finally got to fight him head on and the results were pretty interesting and eventful. This was a good ending since the audience was brought full-circle, but is urged to continue the journey with the return of Hercules.Season 4 DVD has awesome video and audio commentaries with the cast and crew. I really enjoyed the fun and insightful interviews with the cast and the crew. It's exciting to hear about what the actors felt about the episodes, what they thought of the other characters, and how they worked in the production. In each case, they outlined some of the problems and some of the funnier moments shared on the set, as well as background information on the episode.There is also a CD ROM that includes Director and cast biographies, a trivia game, and a database of trivia called The Hercules Chronicles. The other extras included are a photo gallery and an interesting featurette. I definitely recommend any fan to purchase this DVD box set because of all the bonus features made it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the video and audio are of great quality for this set. This is probably one of the best Hercules box sets!
