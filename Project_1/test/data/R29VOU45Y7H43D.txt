Here we go again!  I write this as a female who once again fails to fit the stereotype.In the words of Neuro-Linguistic Programing (NLP) sometimes we have to &quot;sort by difference.&quot;  Men and woman are different, to be sure.  And I think it behooves both men and women to realize this.But in my humble opinion, this book leans more towards generalizing too much. And when I read generalizations, especially those written by educated people, I often fall into the trap of (a) expecting all members of each gender to act the same and (b) thinking that there is something wrong with me because I don't fit the stereotype and (c) feeling like I can't improve my performance on something -- like reading maps -- because genetically and hormonally, I'm not cut out to do it.To be sure, the Peases use other examples besides &quot;men not listening&quot; and &quot;women not reading maps.&quot;  But I will stick to these two.  1.  Even if men &quot;naturally&quot; don't listen, they can learn to do so, and this process is not going to lower their testosterone level.  It's called GOOD MANNERS.  Men are fully capable of doing this.  It may take some practice, as all good skills do.  But it can be done.2.  If women don't &quot;naturally&quot; read maps, they need to be taught how to do so.  There is nothing about estrogen levels that precludes a woman from learning how to read route numbers and to learn that the top of the page is North, the bottom is south, the left is West, and the right is East. And it won't make a woman any less than a woman if she is taught how to use a compass.  It can be done!The Peases try to attempt the &quot;nature-nurture&quot; argument.  I don't know how they would respond to what I have to say here, but I think that there is something to it.  My father has a profession where he has to travel a lot, so I learned to read maps at a very early age.  He is also an artist, so I learned spatial concepts early on, too.  I was also exposed to domestic skills too (i.e., keeping house) and I didn't catch onto that very well!Maybe a book like this can help men and women understand the difference in communication styles.  However, I've had just as much trouble understanding the communication styles of my female friends as I have my male ones.  Maybe if we all practice common courtesy, good manners, and good teaching principles, some of these &quot;general&quot; differences won't be as noticeable. And then we can work on our weaknesses and not feel like we're trapped in them because of our gender. And yet, we will still remain two wonderfully distinct genders who can understand each other just fine.And then I can read a map and not feel guilty!
