I was impressed with the apparently high quality material (yes, it's polyester, but it's not obvious).  With these, you are getting the equiv. of a $150-$175 suit purchased anywhere.  I plan on ordering several more. One word of caution, however, if you are of average build, you might consider trying one size bigger than you think you need to avoid extra modifications.  I own several suits of different brands in size 44R and they fit loosely on me, which is what I like.  I ordered 44R in this particular suit and the shoulders were tight and pants (supposedly a 38) were tight in the waist.  New Era makes exchanges painless; simply return to the address they give you with a note indicating what you want, an exchange or refund, color etc. and they'll send them right out for you.  One size too big... i requested an exchange for 46R and I know I'll be pleased.  So, in general, if you order one size too big, you'll likely only need to hem the pants, otherwise, you may find that you need to let the jacket out and the waist on the pants as well.
 
 UPDATE:  Sent back to exchange for different size and color with no probs - they received it Friday, got the exchange on that next Thursday - excellent company, thanks New Era
 
 ANOTHER UPDATE:  Don't try to remove the tags on the jacket by hand - they are attached using some unearthly industrial strength thread that requires a pair of microscopic scissors and very careful handling to remove the tags without leaving behind a hole, rip or obvious mark of some kind - and I suppose it helps to know what you're doing.
