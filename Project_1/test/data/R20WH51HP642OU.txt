Marta chronicles the sordid details in her diary, and Dario is too busy with his work to notice her sexual drifting. While away at a publisher's convention in the beautiful city of Mantua with her husband, Marta meets a Frenchman while looking at ancient frescos in a museum, and he pursues her aggressively and sexually right there. Soon, her adultery, born out of neglect, boredom and frustration, is in full swing, and she's encouraged by a female friend of hers who's also at the convention with her younger lover. The two women attend a day spa and trade tales of their escapades while being pampered by two Eurovixens employed at the spa, conjuring up all kinds of fantasies for us to ponder over as the women are oiled-up and erotically massaged as though being devoured by their masseuses. Marta is now having sexual dreams and fantasies in addition to her carnal activities, engaging in a variety of increasingly perverse pleasures with Leon, the French lover, and naturally, hubbie Dario finds the diary she explicitly details her affairs in. Now things go from steaming hot to boiling over...it's one of those times when being a perv is a truly wonderful thing. These are women, not girls, and they flaunt their sexuality proudly, libidinous creatures who have not just been around the block a few times, but have frequented the sewers as well. They are lewd, sometimes vulgar, their appetites voracious and lusts almost limitless. Looking slutty, talking dirty, behaving salaciously - what's not to love? Hang on a second, I'm getting weepy... OK, I'm back. There's nary a 30 second frame within the film when we don't have our heads thrust into the breasts, asses, legs, back or nether regions of some delectable Eurovixen's form - this is a voyeur's pastry buffet table, a Lazy Susan of rotating sexual smorgasbords that's guaranteed to delight the demented appetites of undying degenerates everywhere. Tinto Brass knows how to let the camera linger over a woman's form the way Salvador Dali knew surrealism, the way Einstein knew equations, the way Monet knew waterlillies. Uncensored, unflinching, uncut, unyielding, this flick is mandatory viewing for all men who appreciate the female anatomy more than a night of ESPN. Do your self a flavor and savor the juices of 'MonAmour'.The second disc contains the short film 'Kick the Cock' starring Angelita Franco from 2008 (hence the re-release) - it's short, but a keeper, and so is she. The 'Spanish Dance' sequence is for viral voyeurs worldwide, and made me want to visit Spain before I die - actually, waaay before then. There are two 'making of' featurettes worth a watch also, plus trailers for  his other Cult Epic films, but the second disc is the dessert, the real meal here is 'Monamour', IMHO, which truthfully, isn't that humble. Deserving a permanent place in your arthouse exploitation collection for certain. Thank Tinto for having the Brass balls to make these flicks...
