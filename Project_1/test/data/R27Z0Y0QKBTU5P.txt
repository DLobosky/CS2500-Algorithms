Few "mainstream" writers seem to want to explore the strange, and often still classified, world of Nazi tech and science projects and what happened to them at the end of the War (exception being Nick Cook's The Hunt for Zero Point:  Inside the Classified World of Antigravity Technology). This is perhaps Farrell's best book in that it doesn't get into wild theories like some of his others. Here he mines history looking for clues. The accounts of the Nazi and Japanese atomic projects his worth the book alone. War almost came to the mainland (see also Luftwaffe over America: The Secret Plans to Bomb the United States in World War II). He also reviews some of their other projects like energy research and their building of flying saucers. Yes, Farrell's books are highly derivitive of others (i.e. his research is largely made up of reading other people's books), but he has a knack for piecing everything together and coming up with a few original ideas. For a complete library on these topics, get this book, Cook's book and Hitler's Flying Saucers: A Guide to German Flying Discs of the Second World War and Hitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology.
