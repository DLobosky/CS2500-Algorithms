The 15-minute recharging time (for I-C3 batteries only) cannot be beat, and unlike Rayovac's 4-position charger Rayovac Ic3 15 Minute Battery Charger (PS6-4B), this charger is dual voltage. All you need is the appropriate plug adapters and one set of all the Rayovac I-C3 15 Minute Rechargeable Batteries, AA , 4 batteries & Rayovac I-C3 15 Minute NiMH Batteries, AAA Size, 4 Pack required to power all your devices (it comes with Rayovac  I-C3 15 Minute NiMH AA Size Carded 2 Pack). Note: I-C3 batteries do get very hot during their rapid charge, not hot enough to really burn you or to damage the device you put them into, but certainly hot enough to startle you into dropping them if you are not prepared for it. It is also worth noting that the charger switches automatically to trickle-charging in case you want to keep a set of batteries "topped off".
