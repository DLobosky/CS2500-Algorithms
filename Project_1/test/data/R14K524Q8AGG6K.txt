After taking the ton by storm, she could easily make an advantageous marriage, but, scornful of the fortune-hunting beaus who surround her and the superficial lifestyle of the English upper class, she  wants only to return to life in Jamaica.The oh-so-proper Lord Chance is  scandalized by Anjalie's plain speaking and shocking attitudes. She should  not even KNOW about the seamier side of life, let alone go around rescuing  lightskirts from rakes and talking about drunken pirates! But, oddly  enough, he finds himself drawn to her outspoken manner and lack of  pretension. ....
