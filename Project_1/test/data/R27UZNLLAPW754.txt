Oliver Stone goes beyond his first movie about Vietnam telling the story of Ron Kovic, who wrote his own experience in Vietnam in a book that I highly recommend.Kovic served twice in Vietnam (I wished nobody had gone...) and was paralized after being shot twice. Coming back to the US, he is treated worse than a pig in a farm in a hospital for Viet vets. At the beginning, he is a strong supporter of the cause of war (I don't recall this being told in the book), and uses the "Love It or Leave It" BS that I've heard some other place (I mean, is there anything more American than speak freely? Isn't that Democracy?) Soon, though, he realizes how that war is a big lie, and starts joining demonstrations against the war. As in Platoon, we see waht war does with men. You are not a human being anymore. There are some very tough scenes that would make anybody cry. The toughest in my opinion is the one at the village, when they kill innocent women and children. Then, Kovic shoots, by mistake, an American soldier, blinded by the sun, and, also, by the brutality and ferocity or war.Cruise is absolutely gorgeous in this movie, and Oliver Stone won an Oscar for best director. In my opinion, this movie is better than Platoon, because we get to see the life of a soldier before he becomes a soldier. Then we see him fighting, and afterwards, when he is a Vet. So we have the whole picture, and that makes more sense to me than Platoon (even though Platoon is an excellent movie). Tom Berenger and Dafoe have both short appearences here. And that is nice!This movie should be mandatory in all High Schools in America. If there were no soldiers, there would be no wars, and the war in Iraq looks a lot like the war in Vietnam. USA is making the same mistake again, and the government is so blind to see that (or maybe they don't care about the people, just about the business all the weapons' companies -Bush' frieds- are making out of it!). But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government. They always get their way. Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools. How can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools? Is that the education we really think our children deserve? That does not happen any other place in the world, not even in Cuba. Let's invest that money on education. REAL education. How many trilion dollars have Bush wasted in Iraq so far? How much money does the government invest on education? On health? For the people who live and work in America? Parents: teach your children. Nobody should join the Army. Let the politicians -real leaders, not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job, we'll see how many would go. Let the Commander in Chief go to war himself. There is no question about it: there would be no war. They wouldn't go. They would try to negotiate, and try to solve conflicts peacefully. Again, this is a GREAT movie everybody should watch. A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us. Everybody should ask themselves: war ... is it worth it? What for ... ?
