############################################################### This review is for those of  you who are unaware that a dts version the DVD is available, I am actually posting  the review for the dts version of the DVD here. If you have a dts capable DVD player/receiver combination buy the dts version of the DVD. It is available on Amazon. ################################################################Now  Read on ....Among other tracks, this DVD has Hotel California, Tequila Sunrise, The Girl from Yesterday, New York Minute, The Last Resort, Take It Easy and Desperado. I enjoy these the most. This DVD is the most excellently produced DVD in my collection. The video and audio quality are outstanding. When played on a DTS capable receiver, you are &quot;immersed in &quot;  and &quot; surrounded with  &quot; music. You can hear the twang of the guitar-strings, the beats of the drums and the vocals from distinct speaker channels. As one song rolls off to another, you can hear the audience's claps and whistles in the background come through the rear-speakers. The home theatre experience is awesome. This DVD has no drawbacks at all.    If you have a dts decoder in your receiver or on your DVD player, don't forget to select the dts option. It plays Dolby by default. If your receiver is not dts capable, don't worry - the DVD is worth buying, regardless : You'll one day upgrade to dts capable equipment.
