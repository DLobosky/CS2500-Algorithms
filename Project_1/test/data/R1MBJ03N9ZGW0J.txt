The victim, Elias, is a kid of mixed descent; his mother is Thai and his father an Icelander. Usually, in cases like this, the first thing that springs to mind is that it has to be a hate crime, and the detectives who arrive at the scene can think of no other reason for something so cruel to happen to one so young. Living at times like these, when the issues of immigration and the integration of the foreigners in the local culture and way of life are as hot as ever, a case of this sort is bound to upset the public. So, as expected, everyone is pushed to work hard and in a hurry to solve the crime, especially since the pressure from the press keeps mounting; but that's not likely to happen any time soon because there's absolutely no evidence about who the killer might be, and no matter what everyone thinks there's no clear motive either.     The three detectives that are investigating the case, Erlendur, Elinborg and Oli, seem to reach a dead end pretty soon, but they are not willing to give up, and thus sooner rather than later, a piece of information finds its way to them, which could signal a breakthrough; Niran, the dead boy's brother is missing. So they start searching for him, they seek him everywhere they and his family can think of, because it is very likely that he knows something about the murder. At the same time they keep questioning the neighbors, the kids' father who's divorced their mother and no longer lives with them, as well as a man who's been convicted in the past for pederasty.     Niran will not prove that hard to find, but soon enough he will disappear again, this time with the help of his mother, and things as time goes by will start getting more and more complicated since each and every lead the detectives follow always bring them to a dead end.     While all that is happening the author allows the reader to take a good look into the personal lives of his heroes; especially Erlendur's and Sunee's, the kids' mother. The former is a very capable detective, but also a man with way too many obsessions, while some facts from his past seem to haunt his everyday life, just as much as the recent disappearance of a woman -a different case- does. As for his relations with his children they seem to be tense at times, but mostly kind of indifferent. The only person he can really turn to when the going gets tough is his girlfriend Valgerdur, who's doing the best she can to be the rock he needs to lean on. As for Sunee, she's a very strong woman, with an iron will, but nevertheless hopelessly unlucky, as she followed without second thoughts a man to his frozen country and became his wife, only to find out that he was unfaithful to her; as he was to every other woman in his life when it came to that. She was hit, but she had not fallen. Instead she did what she knew best; she started working harder and harder in order to gain enough money to give her children a better life than the one she had, a brighter future. And even now that one of her boys is dead and the other hunted, she doesn't bow her head, she doesn't lose her courage. So everyone who knows her, and everyone who just starts to know her, has no choice but to admire her stance and learn some valuable life lessons from her.     This a great novel that though its plot embarks on a journey around the various circles of society, which is not so much preoccupied with crime but more with the people, that talks about all those little or bigger moments that mark their lives and set their course; towards happiness or into the abyss.     It can easily be read by anyone, whether he likes crime fiction or not, and it sure has a lot to say.
