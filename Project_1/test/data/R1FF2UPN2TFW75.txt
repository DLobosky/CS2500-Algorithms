Starring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, Speed is an adrenalin-pumping movie that is essentially one big extended action scene. Throughout the film's running time the pace never lets up, creating suspense- filled action and excitement. The premise of the action makes for one far-fetched but fun thrill ride.Keanu is the quintessential cool guy action hero Jack Traven who, along with Annie Porter (Bullock) tries not to get blown up by a bomb that retired cop Howard Payne (Hopper) has set on the bus to get money. The entire principal cast are great, especially Hopper, whose character is reminiscent of his crazy bad guy in Red Rock West (1992). With lines like "Poor people are crazy Jack, I'm eccentric", Hopper manages to give a good performance during his rather short screen time. Plus the added quality of the always-good Daniels is first-rate. And Keanu, now best known for The Matrix, is equally cool here. Jan DeBont's direction makes the film a taut, entertaining action ride, and surprisingly, Bullock manages to change from nervy bus passenger to a strong character by the film's conclusion. And the film's musical score creates even more tension and excitement. But the film is not perfect, it's predictable and things get rather monotonous at the end, with yet another gasping of "The track's not finished!" Minor quibbles aside, the action is impressive, and Jan DeBont's visual stylishness gives a really eye-catching look. This action-fest is one of the best. The extras are a real downer, with only a trailer.
