We order 12 of these for our 1st Aid kits, and none even pumped up the wrist band to measure blood pressure.  This is Chinese JUNK at any price.Unfortunately, we did not get around to using (& testing) them until after the return period had expired, so ate the whole bunch.Be warned that Amazon does not stand behind its products.Do not, under any terms, buy this product.Dave Dougherty
