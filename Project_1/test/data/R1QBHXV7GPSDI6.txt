With each turn of a page, we advance two hours and encounter a variety of creatures, from moose to dragonfly.  The two-hour intervals begin at 6 a.m. and continue until the next morning at 6 a.m.  Wadsworth's natural information is good, and Kratter's paintings combine well with the words to make it a unified presentation.  His colorful illustrations have a watery, river-like look to them, which are just perfect for this book.  "River Discoveries" is great for reading aloud at story hour and for introducing children of any age to a river habitat.  The helpful end-page glossary defines concepts that might be new to the youngest readers.This is a book that young nature lovers will never outgrow.  In fact, it's difficult to close the cover and put the book aside.  When you finish it once, you find yourself turning right back to the beginning and reading through it again.
