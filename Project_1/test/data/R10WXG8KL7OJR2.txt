Jeff Bridges won a long overdue Oscar for Best Actor in Crazy Heart.  While Mr. Bridges is excellent as a down and out country singer Bad Blake who hits the booze too hard and has been reduced to playing gigs in bowling alleys and small bars throughout the southwest.  Along the way, he meets a reporter, Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) with whom he has a relationship with and meets up with his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), who is a huge star and helps Bad get back into the big time.  While all the performances are strong, the story feels likes it been told many times before.  It bears an especially strong resemblance to one of the movie's co-stars Robert Duvall's Tender Mercies.  That being said, this film is well worth watching for Mr. Bridges tour-de-force acting and not to be overlooked, Ms. Gyllenhaal's work that received a well deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination.
