I always trust this rechargeable battery for low self discharge, and this might be the 4th - 5th one I am buying, as my electronic items requiring A4 batteries go on increasing. I am happy and satisfied that I can charge and leave them for even a year without using them, and then when I need it - they do not disappoint me. Other rechargeable battery charges used to wear out within a month after charging them, even if not used, and cannot be used when required. I even recommend this battery to my friends.
