The quality Australian EQ label has released their 11th in the Balance series, and it may very well be the best yet.  It is certainly the most consistent line-up of tracks through both discs.  Luke starts off with a few progressive house tracks early on, then takes us on a groovy journey through deep house on disc 1, and into some higher energy electro vibes for disc 2.  There isn't a dull moment on either disc, even from the first listen.  No warming up, no second listen to enjoy, this one hits you right from the start.  Amazing melodic tracks on both discs, this is a true house gem.  A must own mix this year.
