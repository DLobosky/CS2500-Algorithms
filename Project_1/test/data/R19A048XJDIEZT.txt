Originally released in 1977, it was issued on CD in Japan a few years back, but never before available in the U.S. on CD until now.This is a fantastic collection of songs written mostly by other writers (only one track on the original album was written by Melissa Manchester).  It contains one of my all-time favorite Melissa Manchester recordings, her cover of the Beach Boys' "The Warmth of the Sun."Sound quality is pretty much the same as the Japanese CD issue, which is excellent (unlike some of her earlier LPs reissued on Wounded Bird, which are pretty bad).  The liner notes are minimal, and the quality of the artwork is fairly poor, especially when compared to the Japanese issue.What makes this reissue so bizarre is the inclusion of bonus tracks.  These tracks are not from the era of the original LP, and while two of the three bonus tracks have never been issued on CD before, why they were included on this CD is a total mystery.  "Come In From the Rain" is the first bonus track, and it is the 1982 album version from HEY RICKY.  I'm guessing it was included only because Melissa is shown in the rain on the album cover...The other two bonus tracks are very nice to have on CD, but they date to 1982 and 1983, so why they weren't included on the CD reissues of HEY RICKY and EMERGENCY is beyond me.  "Long Goodbyes" was the b-side to two singles that were released from HEY RICKY.  "My Boyfriend's Back (extended 12" version)" is a remix of a track originally included on GREATEST HITS in 1983. and this is the first time this version of the song has been included on any Melissa Manchester album.It's wonderful to have this album available on CD at a reasonable price, but I just have to wonder why Wounded Bird Records did such a sloppy job of reissuing the Melissa Manchester catalog, when, with a small amount of research and effort, they could have issued "definitive" versions of these albums with bonus tracks from the era of each LP.
