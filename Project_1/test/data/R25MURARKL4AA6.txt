After Six Seasons - and still going - this team of British Detectives still keep me in stitches.  The BEST and SMARTEST Television detective show ever!If you've clicked on this review knowing that it is the SIXTH season for this absolutely fabulous BBC detective series, then you have probably watched the previous five seasons. If not, I recommend that you go back and find Season One and start from the beginning. There are two reasons for this: 1) Though each 55-minute episode (unlike the US, the BBC is non-commercial and does not insert commercials in its shows) contains a different crime to be solved, the four main characters' lives evolve over the run of the show. And 2) You'll be missing some great acting in the earlier episodes.As I said in my reviews of previous season's DVDs, "This may be the best TV series ever - in my opinion." Thanks to Acorn Media in the US, this volume (Season Six) is available in the US as NTSC format, these were the episodes aired in the UK in 2009 but they don't seem dated at all.These episodes are like potato chips, you can't stop devouring them once you have started. (But these shows are healthier for you than those chips - or "crisps" if you are in the UK).The last moments of the last show in Season Five did not provide the  "cliff hanger" in that ended Season Four but the series still carries through with certain plot  threads. Though the guy who killed Jack's wife was revealed and captured in the previous Season he returns in the plot. So does Jerry's daughter - played by actor Dennis Waterman's real life daughter.One of the episodes this season takes place at the studio where the James Bond films are made and film buffs will get a kick out of that one.I will not go into the plots of the episodes - they are detailed elsewhere, though I highly recommend that you don't read them in advance. Even when watching I skip the "plot outline" shown at the beginning. It's more fun to "let it happen".While a few of the plots in this volume get a bit too confusing - I find it makes me play them again to see how the crime - usually a murder - took place. But these crimes are only there for the four lead actors to use their own unique personalities and expertise to work together. If there is an underlying theme here it is "teamwork works!:.Like the end of Season Dive , this volume ends with a fairly emotional episode that will stick with you for days after watching it.. Whenever I finish a Season of this show I go through "New Tricks" withdrawal, knowing that it will be another six months before the next season appears on DVD. But since the show is already into Series Eight on British TV, Acorn should be releasing Series Seven in Fall 2012 soon. (I'll try to post a note when I know the date.)UNLIKE the first four seasons, there is a "bonus feature" this time. (There was one on Season Five also ). This time it's a 19-minute "Behind the Scenes" featurette about the "sound crew" and the music used in the film. The show's composer - assisted by his son for some of the music - was a member of The Shadows, Brit-rocker Cliff Richard's backing band and worked with film composer John Barry!So keep on buying this series so that Acorn will keep releasing them. And "Thank you Acorn" for giving us in the US a chance to see one of the best shows on TV.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
