First off there are less sections, but the segements are longer, which I like more since I think choppy short segments don't give you an adequate workout.Lots of cardio in this DVD, and while it is a whole lot of fun, it is very challenging. I was soaked after doing the workout. To give you an idea of my background, I am an intermediate level in fitness DVDs and I have been dancing since the age of 4. I decided to do this DVD from start to finish so I could see the quality of the workouts and time it as well.The first section is Swing with Kym. This is great, alot of what you may have seen in the Jive sections if you got the first DWTS DVD, but it is still a very good workout. Kym not only does swing, she also adds in some Charleston, which was a nice change since I've never done that. You may be a little lost if you don't have any background in dance, but Kym does do her best to explain moves like pas de bouree  the best she can in the few seconds she has before jumping in. Definitely gets your heart rate up with kicks. This was just the first section and I was tired after it--and I still had two more sections to go!Next up was Lacey with Jive. Whoooo!! This moves fast and is similar to the swing section, but the moves are smaller and more precise, so it is more difficult since you have to keep your moves compact. This one was a real burner AND the steps while a lot of fun, again are hard to get down on the first try if you don't have a dance background. And it goes REALLY fast. I even had a hard time keeping up and just had to triple on the spot a few times. She also throws in some little X jumps and squats which were unexpected but complemented the moves quite well and were REALLY intense layered with all the moves in the routine. I thought this was the hardest section until I got to.....Quitckstep with Dmitry. This dance I am totally unfamiliar with, as is most people, so it starts off a little slower in the breakdown of moves. But don't let this fool you, this section must be a HUGE calorie burner because there are a lot of jumps and hops, and the pace speeds up as you go along. Dmitry was great and is absolutely adorable! He is a good teacher for the amount of time you get, and does his best to break down these moves that go so fast and look so easy, but take so much effort. He also throws some jump squats in at the end of the routine, which I enjoyed and felt the next day!Then there is a short cooldown with all 3 instructors, about 8-10 minutes if that. The cooldown is adequate and by that time I was so tired, I just didn't care and any stretches felt good. This is an excellent video and is sure to burn major calories and fat. Here I am the next day and my butt and legs are sore--almost like when I go for a run! It is that good. And it has to be great cardio. I am so glad since I hate doing cardio, this is fun and something I will actually look forward to doing!A couple of cautions: 1) There is no warm up here (which is odd since it is such an intense workout) so if you need a warmup do some light strecthing or aerobics.2)These are fast dances, so you will lose time frequently in your first few workouts. I know I did. So that kind of messes up the routine as you go along. But please don't get discouraged. Just triple step or march in time until the routine starts and try again.All in all,excellent cardio DVD if you are looking for something different and love to dance. I also purchased the DWTS Dance Body Tone and will try it later this week! I will post a review of that as well, but I think "Dance Off the Pounds" is top-notch!
