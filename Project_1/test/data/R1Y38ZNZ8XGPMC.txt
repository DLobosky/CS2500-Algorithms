If a book has lots of lust-filled, dispassionate sex, I'm not impressed. If the sex is a manifestation of love, bring it on.Rating: 8/10 Pros: - Genuinely feel-good, rags-to-riches, "awww" story.- Hot sex scenes - passionate, tender, lots of kissing.- Surprisingly believable "love at first touch" plotline - Rhodes did a better job at developing a loving (as opposed to lusting) relationship very quickly than some other authors do. Possible SPOILER: Part of this is because one of the characters has known about the other for 2 years before they ever meet and is already in love with him. - Well-written - Rhodes is one of the best I've encountered in this genre.Cons: - Short - closer to novella length than novel length.- Rushed ending - almost anti-climactic climax. The climactic scene lasts for about 5 pages, which is okay if you consider how short the story is as a whole. The problem, though, is that Rhodes builds up the suspense throughout the rest of the story (by hinting at what must happen at the end), and then when the moment of truth finally comes along, things are hairy for about a page and a half and then it's all over.- Little development of the fantasy world. What we see of it is beautiful, particularly in one dream-like sequence, but a handful of other details (in addition to the silver tree, for example) would really have rounded the world out.Overall comments: If you're addicted to the genre, as I am, certainly worth a read. If you're more interested in the romance of m/m books than in plot, certainly worth a read. If you prefer stories heavy on the action/drama and lighter on the romance/sex, this one may not be for you.
