The FAQs have other tips as well. I know that Chessmaster XI and Grandmaster are available, but this is still a great game and the reduced price can't be beat. The 10th Edition is the first time animated chess sets are used in the Chessmaster series and the three sets: Clash, Fairytale, and Rubber (colorful Staunton), probably intended for youthful players, are a lot of fun to watch and hear especially when capturing.I'm running it on XP Pro and haven't encountered any problems.
