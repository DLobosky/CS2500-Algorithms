The issues that are affecting every person, citizen or non, of every age in our Country.    Ankarlo has a lot of credibility in his writing as he lives in one of the border state and works as a radio personality.    However, he was willing to go outside his radio studio to walk the streets and interview anyone and everyone who was willing to talk to him.     He didn't just talk to people here in the United States, but also in Mexico.  There is no doubt that Ankarlo is passionate about this topic.      He is so passionate that about two-thirds of the way through the way through the book I wanted to ask him to take a breath, get a drink and just slow down a little.      I could just envision him standing there talking really, really fast.It is rare to have such an insider's look at such a volatile current event in our Country.Disclaimer:  As part of the BookSneeze Review, I did receive this book for free from Thomas Nelson.  The fact that I received complimentary products does not guarantee a favorable review.  It does guarantee a review. A fair review. But I am not going to praise something unless I think it deserves the praise.  If I don't like it, you'll hear that.  And hopefully with enough detail as to why so you can decide for yourself if what I hate about it makes it perfect for your family.
