A combo PCI Host Controller adds 4 additional USB 2.0 ports (plus one internal) and 2 IEEE 1394 6-pin FireWire 400 ports (plus one internal).  Great for external hard drives & cameras. The card fires right up for WIN 2K/XP and does include drivers for Win 9x. Comes with a 6C,4C (M-M) IEEE 1394 FIREWIRE cable.UPDATE: 06.03.08I concur with the reviewer below with regards to USB/FIREWIRE plug clearance when installing this PCI card.  I found that my standard no-name PC enclosure needed modifying for proper plug connection.  Otherwise and excellent bargain.
