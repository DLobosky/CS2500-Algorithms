I've been using Bill Phillips &quot;Body for Life&quot; for over a year,and I love it.Its the last diet and workout book you will ever need.Bill tells you what kind of foods to eat and show's you,with pictures,the best weight workouts and the proper way to do the sets,and how many reps.You don't have to be in the gym for hours doing hundreds of different machins and lifts.Bill just does the basics,and he looks fantastic.Also,I love the idea of cheating once a week,eating anything you want.Even if you want three Big Mac's,Bill tells you to &quot;Go for it.&quot; One thing I changed over the year is the supplements Bill tells you to buy,through the company he owns.If you eat the right foods,six small meals a day.Workout 6 times a week,you will lose weight,and look better than you did 6 months ago.Just remember 6,and you will win.
