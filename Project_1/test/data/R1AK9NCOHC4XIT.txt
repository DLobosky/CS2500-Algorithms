No problems with this LCD monitor at all. It's my first LCD flat panel, so I haven't got much to compare it with, but I must say, I am pleased. Excellent contrast, bright screen, works well with both my 2 year old G4 PowerMac (in OS 9 and OS X) and my 3 year old Windows 98 PC. I had no problems getting it set up or working with either system.Of course, it is a transition from a traditional CRT monitor-there is a set &quot;native resolution&quot; that the monitor looks best in (1280 x 1024). Of course you can use other resolutions, but they are not quite as nice. Since I was planning on setting it at 1280 x 1024, this is a non-issue for me. (All LCD monitors have a set &quot;native resolution&quot;.)  And, color calibration is  ... &quot;different&quot; than it is with a CRT. Also, the colors get a little skewed when I look at the screen from an angle. (In this monitor's case, there is a pretty good viewing range, so I have no complaints.) I hasten to add, these are issues with all flat panels, so it comes with the territory!  All-in-all, minor issues for me.I am very pleased with this monitor, and hope to get another just like it soon.
