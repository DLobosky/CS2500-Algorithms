W00t. The extended version of Fellowship of the Ring is definitely the version that should have been in the theatres...    This version gives you a much warmer Cate Blanchett, not to mention more lines for Celeborn - he doesn't look like such a [weirdo] in this version, either...The gift-giving scene was intercut with the departure of the Fellowship from Lothlorien, which I felt gave it more poignancy.  One mistake in the gifts was that Sam didn't get the box of soil and the mallorn seed, nor did Boromir get anything, but I still think they did a great job on this.Speaking of Boromir, his character development gets more attention in the extended version.  Since Boromir is my favourite character, the flawed hero with the best of intentions, I was glad to see more of his heroic side drawn out, in addition to more interaction with Aragorn. The other thing I was excited to see was the Midgewater Marsh scene, and Aragorn singing the Lay of Luthien.  In Elvish.  Wow. And the Sackville-Bagginses!  Definitely setup for the third movie, when Frodo will return home to find Lotho in his house Hobbiton gets a lot more attention, and I think the beginning of the movie is the part that was edited most extensively.  The attention here is really very loving, narrated by Bilbo ) with an indulgent humour. There was other humour, as well.  You see more interaction between Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo gets a cute little line as the Fellowship leaves Rivendell.  Not to mention the humour of Bilbo's reaction to the S-Bs. All-in-all, the Extended Version is AMAZING.  I highly recommend watching it straight through, rather than looking at your menu and watching only the extended or new scenes.  This watches like a whole new movie.  Peter Jackson rearranged bits of the theatre version and interlaced them with new scenes--it's really very seamlessly done, and an exciting viewing experience.  I didn't get a chance to listen too closely to the additional score, but my first impression is not entirely favourable regarding that--but it could just be because I know the soundtrack by heart, and Howard Shore tampered with some of my favourite bits.  So I can't render an opinion yet about whether the music is good or not.  ( An unexpected plus with my ext. ver. DVD is movie cash good for one free admittance to The Two Towers, beginning on opening night!  Can't wait - at least the first of my anticipated six or eight viewings of TTT will be free!
