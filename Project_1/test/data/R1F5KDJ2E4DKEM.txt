This description said it was for pets up to 12 pounds, so I felt it would be about the right size.  What I received was a carrier that says it is for pets up to 20 pounds and my dog is swimming in it.  There is room to put my fanny pack in the carrier with my dog and still have extra space.  I put a small blanket in the bottom for comfort since it is a nylon-type material.  It's a bit of a stretch for him to stick his head out of the top, but he tries.  What I received matched a description of another item that said it was best for longer dogs.I wish the description of the carrier was more detailed because I saw another carrier with the same name, for pets up to 20 pounds that folded into a small carrying case.  I was hoping this one did.  It is a bit bulky and will take up more room than I hoped in my suitcase.  I am debating whether to send it back or try to adapt it to him. A couple of things I do like are the strap that snaps across the carrier that makes me feel that he is a little safer in it - and there is a very small zippered pocket where I could put keys or a little money.  Update- I just found out that the older products showed a weight limit of 12 pounds and the newer ones say 20 pounds, but they are the same item.
