The 2 stars are for "Arena" which although requires a massive leap of faith to believe Kirk invents a "gun" while on the run in a manner which to any observer would realise is much, much more likely to blow up in his face instead does have a very good moral about how jumping to conclusions and fighting before diplomacy is not the best way to solve differences (George Bush, you listening?)which redeems an otherwise very average episode.Too bad you can't give negative, anti-stars, as the "Alternative Factor" to put it candidly, really sucks big-time!  The storyline is just simply ridiculous and the whole episode is riddled with errors.  In the beginning, Spock tells Kirk there is no life on the planet below; if he meant animate life, he should have said so as we are soon transported to the surface where all manner of plant-life is seen.  This is just one example but overall, the script-writing and acting are among the worst of this the first season.Save your bucks for another volume.
