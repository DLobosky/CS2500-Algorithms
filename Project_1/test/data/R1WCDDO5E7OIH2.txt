I received my first set these extremely useful and - for the price - sturdy containers in April 2012. I liked them so much that within one week I had ordered another set. These 66 quart size containers are the ones most in demand and appear to have the greatest overall utility (based on size, dimensions, etc.) A key feature of these containers that contributes to their usefulness is their ability to be stacked one on top of the other. Thus, you can store a lot in a relatively small footprint. So order one or more sets of these (4) containers and do something worthwhile around your house: Play that childhood game of "building blocks" once again, but this time use these plastic beauties- fill them up and stack them high - get organized and get rid of all that clutter at home. You will be glad you did, highly recommended!NOTE: The limiting factor in stacking these containers is the weight of the items that you place inside. The boxes are not designed for "extremely heavy" items. A somewhat sturdier container (thicker plastic with better locking latches) of comparable size by Sterilite is also available here on Amazon.com (Sterilite 19888004 70-Quart Ultra Storage Box See-Through with White Lid and Titanium Latches, 4-Pack), but at an approximately 75% greater cost for a pack of 4 (about $75.00) it is somewhat doubtful that this would be the better buy with regard to getting the most bang for your buck, but it's your decision.
