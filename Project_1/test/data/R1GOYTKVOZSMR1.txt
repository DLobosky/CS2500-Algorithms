My wife love this show,she give it a 5* but  I am hearing impaired and need Closed Captioning,  adjusting the volume on my tv makes the sound louder especially the music but not more understandable to me. I especially need Closed Captioning when the actors have accents, as in Downton Abbey. I am American, so the British accents in this show make it that much more difficult for me to understand. Closed Captioning would be a HUGE improvement! TUDOR gets a 10*
