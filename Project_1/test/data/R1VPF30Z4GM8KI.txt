They're like football referees and baseball umpires: they're at that best when you don't notice them.  In other words, they're performing their jobs at such a high level of professionalism and efficiency, you're locked in on the game itself.  Likewise, with this excellent product from Logitech I'm entirely focused on my thoughts and what's on the screen, and not the quirkiness or difficulty in getting my thoughts transcribed *onto* the screen.  My previous keyboard was the Logitech diNovo Keyboard for Notebooks.  About that keyboard: distractions and quirkiness eventually did me in.  As I noted in my review of that product, "I kept overreaching for keys. Scratching my head, I measured the distance between the left-side of the '1' and the right-side of the '0' - it's a full one inch shorter in length than my laptop keyboard! That's taken quite a bit to get used to."  I never did get entirely used to it.  Thus, my step up to this better alternative from Logitech.
