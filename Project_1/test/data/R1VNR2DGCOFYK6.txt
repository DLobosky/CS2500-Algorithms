::UPDATE::  Now my 2nd warranty replacement has begun to fail...in the exact same manner as my first pair failed.I spent 25 minutes on hold waiting for a CS rep, who informed me that the product warranty goes off of the original purchase date, so I'm technically out of warranty.  However, given all of the issues I've had with them, they might waive it (still waiting to hear back on that).However, that poses the question of whether I would actually want another replacement.  I don't want to have to go through the same problems six months down the road.  The CS rep proposed the possibility of me switching to an in-ear pair of their headphones.  The only problem is that their most expensive pair of in-ear headphones cost $50 less than what I paid for my Solo HDs.It will be interesting to see what they propose as a solution.::END UPDATE::First my Solo HD's had a problem w the rubber gasket on the top of my head coming off bc the glue seemed to be failing.  The polite, but uninformed customer service rep told me it was fully removable for cleaning.  Yeah...notsomuch.  I got home and pulled it off, only to realize it could no longer be put back on.  So, I put in a warranty claim.Then I got my new pair of Solo HD's as a warranty replacement.  Defective out of the box.  So I'm now 0 for 2 w their poorly made product.  Another warranty claim.  Again, the customer service reps I dealt w were very nice and went so far as to send me a pre-paid shipping label to send back my 2nd defective pair, as well as upgraded me to 3-day shipping when they send me my 3rd pair.Then a couple of weeks went by.  Package was lost by FedEx.  There was supposed to be a 1 or 2 day delay for FedEx to investigate and before Monster would ship me a new pair.  That was one week and numerous calls to customer service ago.  I have yet to receive any notification that the headphones have shipped (CS told me their new system would notify me.)So, I write this as I'm on hold...again...w Monster customer service.  Hold times are usually ~15 min or more w some of the worst hold music, both from a taste and a fidelity/sound quality perspective, that you have EVAH heard.In summary, Monster......makes poorly made/low durability products.  I am waiting for my THIRD pair on my original 1 yr warranty.  In fact, if you read their warranty closely, you will note that you technically void your warranty if you wear the headphones outdoors....has very friendly, very understaffed and very incompetent customer service.Spend your money elsewhere.
