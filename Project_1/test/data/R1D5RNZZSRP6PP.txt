Shouldn't I?" -- and, once I started reading, I couldn't help but think: I can't wait to review this. I can't wait to share the conundrum, the utter quandary of emotions, that is this book.I will say this to start: this book had all the elements to make it a brilliant read. After all, it contains many things that make for good stories that stick with you: an interesting premise to capture you, beautiful writing to enrapture you, startling emotions and scenes to make you think and ponder, and characters you come to love even despite their flaws. No, I won't say this book was an easy read -- or even a comfortable one at times -- but it was jagged and a bit painful at times. It's a book that you just have to set down for a time because it affects you so, and then you aren't so eager to pick it back up again. But, if you do trudge through it, the brilliance does manage to shine through. The writing is beautiful, poetry on the page, but the story itself is far from pretty.Now, from just reading the synopsis, you might think that the way to Palimpsest is simply sex -- but, no, it's a bit more complicated than that: the city itself becomes an obsession to any who accidentally come to be within it, and the road to get back to it is somehow always laced with pain. Pain is a given in this book: the four main characters are all broken souls, people who have lost things and people and meaning, so of course they latch onto the one hope they have in their lives. And that hope is Palimpsest.I'll admit that I'm not a person who likes to read sex scenes -- especially those that are casual and lacking in a bond of love -- but I suppose it was a bit easier for me to read because I understood that the sex was just a means to an end. Most of the sex scenes involve high emotions ranging from desperation to grief to just sheer madness. All of these people are broken, lost souls, and they seek refuge through the city of Palimpsest. Yes, it's irrational to me as an outsider, but I suppose that's the point.The book started out slow for me; I felt the most answers came towards the last one hundred pages of the story. I felt less frustrated by that time and more engaged in the ordeals of the four main characters, all of whom suffered in their own ways. Yes, by then, I wanted them to succeed.Catherynne M. Valente created a rich world with Palimpsest -- a land akin to the realm of Fairies, almost -- but Valente's strength in her writing and world-building is also a flaw, however. While she thrives on details and sweet nothings, I sometimes felt lost as a reader -- as if I were an observer who didn't have all the information I needed. Still, though, the book managed to astound me with its sometimes horrific twists that bordered on things found in grim fairy tales of old. It's no wonder since Valente is obviously a fan and student of mythology, lacing her writing with nods to folklore and myth from around the world. Her writing style is something to behold since you do feel as if you are reading something strange and new, almost like a lost fairy tale, and it is both astounding and confounding. It's a bit of a trippy read, true, but it also has meaning and emotion that seem to make all the strange qualities worth it.Overall -- I am glad I read it. The book gets four stars alone because I loved the writing -- and, by the end, I was satisfied with everything that had come to pass. No, it was not exactly laid out the way I would have done. . .but, then again, I would never have come up with a story about a city that can only be reached through physical intimacy. Ah, well, I still enjoyed it despite its flaws, and I hope others will give it a chance someday too.
