Despite the title of my review, I didnt expect this book to give me solid answers to theological questions that only God Himself can reply. However, I couldnt stop myself from expecting much from the same author who gave me divine experience with his classics like  "The Bible Jesus read", "Finding God in unexpected places", "Where is God when it hurts?", "The Jesus I never knew", "Soul Survivor", and my all time favorite "What's so amazing about grace?". Some reviewers comment that this is a very deep and difficult book. However, I really think that the author has been improving himself so much over time that his recent works are much better than this one which is a collection of his essays first published on Christianity Today before 1989. In this respect, I should congratulate the author and thank God for using the author to preach His messages so well. However, as a consumer and a common christian, I am obligated to recommend the author's other books (like those mentioned above) instead of this one.
