As a viewer I was much obliged that Mr. Harris also does not make the film anything like most of the movies of today.The story is decidedly nothing new: a pair of mercenary lawmen have been summoned to the frontier town of Appaloosa.  Harris plays Virgil Cole, who even villains know is both deadly with a gun and a man of his word.  Viggo Mortensen plays Virgil's partner of a dozen years, Everette Fitch, not as famous as Cole, but never without his 8-gauge shotgun. Virgil and Everette are not men of words, and one of the strengths of this film is the ability of the actors to show you what these powerful men are feeling without resorting to vocabulary that neither possesses.  (One of the running jokes of the film is that Virgil WANTS to use "big words", but in almost every scene he comes to a sentence where he wants to use a word that he can't quite find.)Appaloosa is being menaced by Rancher Randall Bragg, played by Jeremy Irons.  Mr. Bragg is the kind of man who employs a gang of roughnecks to threaten the town and enforce his will.  Bragg's men harass women, kill men, steal and plunder, then celebrate with too much whiskey down at the saloon.Enter Virgil and Everette.Complicating things are the mysterious Mrs. French, a fetching widow played by Renee Zellweger.  Mrs. French has a thing for alpha males, and when he's around, Virgil Cole is always top dog.The movie has a few tricks and surprises up its sleeve, but it also stays squarely in the lines of the most classic of westerns.  I believe the Duke would have approved.
