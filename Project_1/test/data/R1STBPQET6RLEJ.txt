Right off the bat, beware that this series has nothing in common with his beloved detective novels set in modern day Botswana.  It is hard to believe that he wrote too such different types of books.The Portuguese Irregular Verb series of which "At the Villa Reduced Circumstances" is just one book can best be described as a droll send up on the absurdities of academic life.  McCall's style can best be described as extremely dry and verging on the absurdist.  This type of subtle humor is not for everyone.  The books in the series do not need to be read in order.  I would recommend that you start with "The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs", the best book in the series.  If you like this type of humor gone onto the other two books.  If you like your humor dry and way over the top, this is the series for you.
