I have a long history with music and audio but have never invested in anything other then $30.00 headphones.So,after researching customer reviews and visiting sites like Headroom-right between your ears,and testfreaks I couldn't decide between the Sennheiser HD280 pro and Grado sr60.The Grados are open and the Sennheisers are closed.So,I got both and appreciate each for their qualitys.Both deliver undistorted sound and that intimate detail your looking for in headphones. The closed design is great for walking with my iPod and they reduce most of the traffic noise around me,not to mention keeping my ears warm in the Colorado winter.I also thought the long coiled cord would be a problem with walking with a iPod but I just wad it up and stick the excess in my pocket.It really isn't a problem and the coiled cord is very functional under other applications.They also power up well with my iPod set at 70%  of full volume which is very important if you are buying headphones to use with a MP3 player . I love these Sennheiser's and they sound at least as good as the venerable Grado sr60.But each have quality characteristics that contribute to a pleasing audio experience.Buy these if you need ambient noise reduction and the Grado's if you plan on using them in a quite environment.
