While they don't need to be read in order to be enjoyed, I do know that Pump Me Up (book 2) contains characters from Spot Me (book 1), so there is some overlap. Regardless, you won't be "lost" if you read out of order; stuff may make more sense, though.  Spot MePump Me Up (Spot Me)Core TrainingCrunch Time (Work Out)Positive Resistance (Work Out)Personal Training (Work Out)Spot Me is a quick read. It's a M/M romance novella, so if you are wanting complex plots and extremely detailed characterizations, this is not the book for you. However, if you want a quick, enjoyable read, it's a worthy purchase. While the sex scenes are hot, they are few and far between. Grey chooses to focus more on the budding romance between the two main characters, and he does so in such a manner so the story is completely believable and realistic. Dan and Gene are physical opposites and, just as in the real world, have a hard time figuring out what each sees in the other. While their conversations can be trite at times, each figures out the connection is based on more than mere physical attraction and works hard to develop a well-rounded relationship. I look forward to finishing the remainder of the series and hope character development and detail are improved in future installments.
