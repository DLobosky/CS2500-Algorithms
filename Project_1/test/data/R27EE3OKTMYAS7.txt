Extremely impressed at how this classic tale was presented.  As an adult with no kids, this was a bit nostalgic for me.  The highly technical programming that makes the interaction effortless deserves an award in itself.  You control the experience such as music on, off or level. You may also choose to read yourself, or be read to.  You can click on any word in the book and it repeats it.  Click on every critter, and it reacts.  Pull/drag tabs for movement. Catch falling objects like berries, collect them and fill you screen, pick them up or rotate your Kindle or tablet so see them move in the direction on you turn.  But the main point here is the story with it's wonderful vintage presentation.  Turn off all the bells and whistles for kids learning to read, and reward them by reading again with it's fascinating features. I'm now off to look at other creations by this developer because after collecting about 200 apps, be it free or paid, this is by far one of the most creative.  A free app on Easter, but if you missed it, it's worth every penny. Thanks for the memory!
