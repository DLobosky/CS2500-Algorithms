When not in use, we wind them around the bed and let them sit there.  They do make a very cute display.These are firmly stuffed: they can be twisted and bent but always go back to their shape easily.  They are also very soft and nice for bedtime.In all, great quality for a great price.  We love these Wild Republic snakes!
