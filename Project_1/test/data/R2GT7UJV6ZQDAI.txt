I did appreciate the work involved in the Film, the Stunning Visuals as we watched the four Friends growing up together, the abuse they endured throughout School setting up the pattern for things to comeWhen two of them turn Gansters as they call themselves, All Hell Breaks Loose, some very Violent Scenes hard to watch definitely Not for kids; you have to be Korean to understand not only the language but the Culture, Subtitles alone wasn't enough to fully appreciate the Film"FRIEND" is only 113 minutes long...Yes, that's a long time when you're not having fun, but it could have been 226 minutes the lengh of "Once Upon a Time In America" twice as long, nonetheless "FRIENDS" A Big Struggle to keep on Watching... Thank God for Fast Forwarding!!
