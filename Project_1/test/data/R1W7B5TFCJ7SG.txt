This little Tikes Gardening set has a set of gloves, a small watering can, pail, a hand rake and shovel. The shovel, hand rake and flower watering can are made from a very durable plastic. The watering can is really neat because it's not to big and is very easy for your toddler or child to carry when it's full of water. Most children's watering cans are light when empty and so heavy once there is any more than 1/2 full. My daughter 28 month old daughter loves to water EVERYTHING!!!! If your a gardner, this is perfect for your budding gardener!
