Most of the voters were women who were voting for the best romance novel among various romance subgenres.  This book is now one of my all time favorites.Quality writing.  Good lines.  Good thoughts.  Interesting conversations.  It feels like 50% of the story is about the relationship and the sex scenes, but the other half is fully developed with very good plot and characters.  The sex scenes are tremendous.  The passion between these two men is the greatest turn on (and I'm a hetero female).  And the kissing scene - it's better than any other male-female kissing scene that I can remember.  Wow!  So hot!  This is my first gay male romance book, but now I am on the lookout for more.Most romance stories have a separation of the couple, and many authors use "the big misunderstanding" as the cause.  This author used a very believable and necessary reason to separate the couple, which I appreciated.  I didn't want the book to end.  I wanted to stay in their world, so I am glad the author is continuing to write vignettes on her website.  So far, she has three short scenes in the life of D and Jack after the book.  I enjoyed them.  By the way, I think the cover picture on the book is good and fits the guys.POETRY - THE TITLE:"Zero at the bone" comes from an Emily Dickinson poem about a snake.  The poet says that she has never met this fellow "without a tighter breathing and zero at the bone."  I'm not clear about the meaning, but it's not cordiality.  I'd like to hear others' thoughts.  I've heard about being so cold you feel it in your bones, but that doesn't exactly fit.  For this book, I believe "zero at the bone" relates to D's total shutdown of emotion.Carrie, a friend of mine on Goodreads, wrote the following.  "The poem is called Narrow Fellow in the Grass.  The last stanza deals with how the author feels every time she encounters a snake in the wild, essentially by breathless and "to the marrow" fear. One commentator thought as you did, "cold to the bone" and another focused on the word "zero" and the emptiness that alludes to perhaps "paralysis" or being too affected to move.  Taken this way, the "snake" of the poem may mean the person behind everything in the book, and the shaken, fearful person could be first Jack, and then D as well, once his emotions are involved."  Thanks Carrie.STORY BRIEF:Jack is a surgeon walking to his car in a public garage.  He sees two mobsters killing a woman and agrees to testify.  He is taken into a witness protection program while waiting for the trial.  D is a hit man who only takes cases to kill "bad guys."  He refuses to take jobs like this, killing a witness.  However, someone has evidence against D and blackmails him into taking the contract to kill Jack.  So D shows up in Jack's "protected" apartment ready to shoot, but he doesn't.  Instead he decides to help Jack go on the run and stay hidden until the trial.DATA:Story length: 293 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.
