But I have better ears than most people and find a lot of speakers this way to me. Needless to say I'm picky.It did come with many different sizes of ear pads and a little zipper case. Case has a hard interior core with a cloth liner and a soft interior lining and raised rubber engraving on the top. Honestly, a bit bulky for a set of plugs. But it does have a nice pocket in the top for the extra plug parts and the plugs aren't too hard to coil up in there and zip closed.My biggest complaint is the right one sounds like a soda can when you squeeze it and the aluminum pops in and out just slightly. When I put it in my ear, or in any way push on the piece (like to get it seated in my ear better), it makes that noise. Very loud and annoying. To me this is enough to not care for them. However, again, I'm picky, but this sound actually hurts my ears when it happens. And it only seems to be the right one so I figure it's a manufacturing flaw with my particular set and not likely something most of them will do. Strangely, I can't replicated it out of the ear either so it has something to do with the neck and rear can. Once it is in place, it doesn't do it anymore though so it doesn't effect the actual listening unless I bump it or something. I doubt this is something the average person would ever run into with their set though and I wouldn't worry about it much as a purchasing decision either.Other thing I'm not fond of is the L/R indicator (or in this case, just L...) is almost invisible, and hard to find in the dark or by feel. A simple dimple on the back could have helped. The L is raised, but barely and on the tapered neck part of the wire. It is also not colored so it's stealthily in place and hard to read in poor light. The J2's in contrast had contrasting colors at least (not raised).I ordered a set of J2's at the same time and honestly, I like the tonal quality of those better. They still aren't near as good as my other insanely overpriced brands, but that's not a fair comparison either. They are very good, if not excellent for what they are. I like the J3's but I like the J2's more. Obviously sound-shaping, if available on your device, can help remedy these sound preference items and every person will hear differently but, out of the box, after burn-in, they are still a bit bright for me.For the record, I went through a full break in procedure for 4 nights for each set before testing using JLab's own break-in procedure and tones... for what it's worth. They did seem to warm up some after that but... not enough to replace my best set. Enough to use casually though and be satisfied. For the price however, it would be difficult to find a better set. I also listen at relatively low volumes (one reason my ears are still so good). If you liked higher volumes, I don't know their tonal qualities. However, they seemed pretty stable up to a level that hurt me (which most people would consider only moderately loud).The next test would be longevity. But that would take time. I've spent the last week using the J3's for my casual stuffs. This week I'm going back to the J2's. I save my 'best' pair for my best moments (they aren't cheap) but these do a darn good job for daily listening. Off the cuff, I will say the wiring on the 2's seems stronger and more robust than the 3's.As for noise canceling, the J3's do a surprising job of keeping outside noise at bay. On that note I was impressed. I'm not sure exactly if they are noise canceling (as with inverse-wave introduction as with other sets) or simply their ear-plug effects as my listening as mostly been in a quiet atmosphere anyhow but things like the AC fan and the dog snoring (ya... he's loud) and the traffic outside were completely shut out.
