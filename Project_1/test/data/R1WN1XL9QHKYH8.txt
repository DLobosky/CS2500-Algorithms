Sadler is able to capture the character of Casca very well in this one, and develops other characters or character types that will appear in later novels. The story is fast moving, yet detailed.  Action is almost non-stop from cover to cover, yet all quite realistic.  The nice thing about the Casca books, is that after the first one is read, you really do not have to read them in order, each book is a good story within itself.This story covers the period of time when he Eternal Mercenary is fighting for the German Army during WWII and as the title would indicate, as a member of a Panzer Division.  The action, for the most part, takes place on the Eastern Front.  A vivid description, as seen through the eyes of Casca of the Battle of Kursk in the central feature on which Sadler hangs this tale.  We follow the warrior and his tank crew through the entire battle and their escape.  Of course other engagements are featured along with the story of the personal lives of each of his men. While my favorite of this series include the adventures of Casca in earlier times, i.e. his periods fighting with the Roman Legions, Persian adventures, sailing with the Vikings, etc., this more modern story fits well with the over all theme of Sadler's work.Again, as with most of his novels, Sadler has done a wonderful bit of research. This is certainly true of this one. The few errors he did make were of little moment. Very much recommend this one.Note:  It is unfortunate that these books are out of print and unfortunate, but not surprising, that copies are selling for top dollar at this time.  I am lucky in that I have a complete set of the entire series and am not about to part with them.  Alas though, they have been read and reread over the years and are now falling apart.  It would be of great service if these books could be purchased for the Kindle.  A new author is now writing for the franchise, and after a couple of complete duds by other authors, this new one seems to have his stuff together...hopefully Amazon and the publishers can come to some sort of arrangement. Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
