RETURN OF THE BAD MEN was the third in a series of three RKO Westerns made in the late 1940s starring Randolph Scott (the other two were BADMAN'S TERRITORY and TRAIL STREET). It's a rip-snorting, old timey "shoot'em up," with every outlaw and bad man of the old West thrown in for good measure---for Randy Scott to deal with. Gabby Hayes adds great comedic value. Very entertaining actioner.
