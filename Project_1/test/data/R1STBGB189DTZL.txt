When I bought this pillow, I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  It was heavy, way too firm, and so big that I could hardly get it into my pillow case.  But I suffered from headaches at least 3-4 times a week, and was pretty much willing to try anything at that point.It was difficult to get used to sleeping on the pillow.  It's very firm, and has that strange almost hollow shape to it.  When I'd lay on my back, it was so firm it would actually make my ears hurt from pressing into the pillow.  But the very first night I used it, I noticed that I slept better.  After a couple of weeks, it did soften up a bit, where my neck normally rested.  Once I got used to the pillow, it was quite comfortable to sleep on my back or side.  Now I can't sleep on any other kind of pillow!I don't believe I snore as much, when I use this pillow.  Or at least, I don't wake myself up from snoring as much.  I sleep better through the night.  And I rarely wake up with headaches any more.  For me, it has done everything it claimed, and more.I bought this product on April 4, 2010.  I've now owned it for a year and a half, and I still love it.  I wash my pillows about once a month, and it's held up beautifully.  The area that cradles my neck has softened quite a bit, so I will probably be replacing my pillow with a new one, in a few months.  But 2 years for a pillow to keep it's firmness is pretty darn good.I really can't say enough good about this pillow.  I can't guarantee that you'll have identical results to me, but for my specific case, it has been one of the greatest things I've ever spent money on.
