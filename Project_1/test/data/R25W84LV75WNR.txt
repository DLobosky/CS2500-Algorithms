Thankfully, Flora Slosson Wuellner appears as a bright luminary in the gap.Flora Slosson Wuellner is a gifted Christian healer who addresses the whole person in her healing arsenal. (See her "Prayer and Our Bodies" for her insights about the body.) Unlike the many eccentric faith healers one may see on TV, she has a profound understanding of God and a equally perceptive understanding of the human condition.FSW excels in focusing on the radiant love of God to bring about the deeper healing of our inner wounds. Her writings reflect her intimate relationship with God and that very personalized feature marks what is most profound about her writings.FSW counsel is graced by a non-violent compassion and gentleness. Read a lot of today's spiritual or self-help guides and you are liable to be urged to (pick one of the following) eradicate your ego, annihilate your false self, shed your illusion that there really is a self, pry off your masks, crucify your desires... (you get the message).FSW responds: "God - the God we see through Jesus - does not force us. Egos are not to be killed but, rather, healed and transformed. Masks are not to be ripped  off. The fear beneath them is healed until the mask falls off naturally like a scab off healed flesh. The walls are not to be torn down but healed, perhaps slowly, back into permeable borders...". God's healing does not violate us or inflict more violence upon our inner traumas and fears. FSW is one of the few voices who articulates that important aspect of inner healing as clearly as she does.This is a great book for a much needed facet of inner healing that deals with the soul toxicity we pick up from environments of stress, hostility and anger. Not all of our inner pain is from our own doing. As social beings, we pick up the soul malaise of those around us often in very unconscious ways.This is a book that is clearly and simply written that will communicate to a wide variety of readers. Ample prayers and guided meditations are given after each chapter to aid the reader in actual healing practice.I have profited immensely in working through her books in times of deep emotional pain and highly recommend this (actually all her writing) to all those that need the gentle voice of a healer guiding the way forward.
