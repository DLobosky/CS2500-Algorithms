This movie is easily one of the best anime movies ever. It has a very good plot, fluid-like animation, and an excellent orchestral score. Although it is very entertaining and pretty much stand-alone, viewers can benefit more if they get some background information on Kosuke Fujishima's work of the 3 goddesses and their earthly friends, since the movie doesn't spend much time introducing the characters and their relationship.Anyway, I enjoyed the movie so much that I went out and bought the soundtrack CD :)
