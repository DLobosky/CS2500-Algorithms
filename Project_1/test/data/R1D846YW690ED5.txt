The brush heads are too hard for my liking. Brushing the top teeth for me is an unpleasant experience. I wouldn't say I get headaches, but not at all a pleasant experience for me. The brush works well, but I do prefer to use my Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush with the optional soft brush heads. The Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a very powerful brush, although not a sonic brush, does an effective job of cleaning my teeth.
