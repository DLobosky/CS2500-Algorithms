With better production than the earlier albums and tighter songs than the later albums, Love Agenda is a compelling mix of loud guitars and enigmatic lyrics.The three way guitar interplay between Robert Poss, Page Hamilton, and Karen Haglof make this an album to play extremely loud.One star deducted for wussy drums. Otherwise, definitely worth seeking out at your favorite used record shop.
