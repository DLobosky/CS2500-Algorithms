This closer really does what it claims: it does't whack you on the Achilles tendon when you step inside the house. It closes more smoothly, without a fast start. The manufacturer, Greenstar, has a neat video that shows how this "smooth" version works: http://www.touchnholddoorclosers.com/en/products/31/touch-n-hold-smooth/I have bought both the original (non-smooth) and this smooth one, and can confirm that the "smooth" version is much superior. It includes the excellent step-on button to hold it open.Also available is a top-and-bottom "smooth" pair which helps to ensure that the screen door closes more tightly at top and bottom: Touch'n Hold Smooth Dual Kit Storm and Screen Door Closer
