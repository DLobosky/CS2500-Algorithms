It is well known that when certain molecules (ligands) attach themselves to receptors in the vomero-nasal organ (which is inside the nasal canal) certain physiological responses are initiated and certain "drive states" are moved to a state of priority.  Products such as this one will give off pheromones 1000 times more powerful than what the average man can produce.Due to the potentcy of this product, it should be used responsively.  It's not for beginners because it's easy to over/misuse.  One or two little dabs is more than enough and it should be covered with either cologne or a deodorant because the stuff really stinks.  When I got it in the mail, I took off the cap and smelled it.  After one sniff, I had to forcefully close my eyes for a moment and grimace.  Since it contains androstenone, it's a dominant male pheromone.  It can and will cause respect from other males but can also cause problems when they're other alpha males around.  I would strongly advise against wearing this pheromone to work or to any other formal setting.  Another interesting thing is that it causes very negative reactions around women who are on their periods.  It also tends to make me have a shorter temper, more assertive and aggresive.  As far as women are concerned... I can wear this and go to the mall and have women and girls look at me as if I'm some sort of celebrity.  In experimenting with this product, I've gotten some unbelievable reactions.  The most extreme reaction I've had was an outright proposition.  It's really amazing how I can just be having casual conversation and how quickly the conversation will take another turn.  I wondered "where did that come from?".  Even when one isn't talking to a woman but is in their vicinity it causes reactions.  Some women are affected by it more strongly than others though.  I get a lot of blushes, flushing and squirming in their seats (as if they have ants in their pants) and smiles.  This product will definately get you noticed!  This is definately not a "friendly" pheromone.  Don't use this if your only purpose is to socialize.  I leaned that the hard way.
