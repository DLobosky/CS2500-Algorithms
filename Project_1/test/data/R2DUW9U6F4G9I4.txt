Unfortunately, the Neo-flex felt wobbly and flimsy, even with all the adjustments tightened, and I wasn't willing to trust my expensive monitor on it. I moved the Neo-flex over for use with my 22" monitor, where it works perfectly, and ordered the more expensive LX Desk Mount arm. The difference between the two products was apparent as soon as I opened the box. The LX arm is a much more solid product, with more options, expansions, and adjustments. With the Neo-flex arm, I was able to put my 24" monitor close to where I wanted it, with the LX arm I can get it in exactly the right place for the most comfortable viewing. While it sounds counter-intuitive, I used the included extension to get the monitor slightly lower and farther back on the desk. The options for motion and adjustment seem endless, I can tilt the monitor for better viewing if I'm standing at my desk, or swing it to the side and around if I need to reach the back connections to plug in additional cables. I have this arm mounted on a Legar&eacute; 60" x 47" Corner Desk using the cable management grommet in the corner of the desk.
