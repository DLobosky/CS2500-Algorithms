I have owned a number of burr grinders, not to mention blade ones. Most of the ones in this price range are Chinese, and seem to use the same non-conical grinding mechanism that simply does not grind fine enough for a pump espresso machine.  In other words, everything else is cosmetics, with the same poor quality mechanism.  This is OK if you never make espresso. They work great for moka pots and drip makers.But my La Pavoni and Hamilton Beach machines need it finer. This unit actually can grind down to near Turkish coffee powder, which is actually TOO FINE for espresso!  I was pleasantly shocked! But, at the standard "fine" setting, not "extra fine" it does the job very well.I'd give it five stars, but for the fact that at the finest grind, it can clog up and nothing comes out. This can be unclogged, but it is a small bother.Someday, I hope to find one of those expensive Italian Rancillo machines at a sale, just as I found my La Pavoni for $40 and this unit for $2.50. The espresso gods like me.
