I think my two largest complaints and frustration comes with the touch screen and the 12 power zoom.  The touch screen drains the battery faster than my other Canon Powershot cameras and the zoom is incredibly difficult to get stable when at full 12 power and my pictures haven't turned out as well as I would like at that distance.  Overall, I really didn't like the Canon Powershot 310, so I am on the fence as to whether or not I will keep this one.  I have a few more days to think about it.  For now... here is a more detailed list of pros and cons:Pros:- Takes incredibly good photos with regard to color.- Easy to use.- The vivid setting is great for flowers and fall colors.- I love the fisheye effect without having to carry around my Canon DSLR camera and lenses.  I also love having the wide angle.- The miniature setting is kind of fun to use.- Feels incredibly heavy and solid, unlike the new 310.- Fits easily in my purse and pocket.Cons:- Can't stand having finger prints all over the screen when I go to take my picture.- Touch screen drains the battery pretty quickly over the other Canon Powershot cameras.- When zooming out, it is very difficult to keep it steady.  Not sure what to order if I send this one back.  So, I am still on the fence, as I am partial to Canon cameras over Nikons.  The red color is not as it is shown in the picture.  It is more of a rust/burgandy color of red... it has a bit more brown to it, but I actually like it.UPDATE: 12/12/2011 - I ended up sending this one back and kept the Canon 310.  I am really glad I did.  I get a great battery life and when I compared the photos on this camera vs. the 510, the photos had better color and looked a lot more crisp from the 310.  I am happy with my decision.
