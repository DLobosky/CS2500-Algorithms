Man this movie is a classic, it is funny and entertaining the whole way through. I really miss those 80's movies where they played all the popular music and had silly situations all the way through. This movie can be watched over and over and over. Trust me, you'll be quoting Axel for days, and don't get me started on his silly laugh! Don't forget to slow motion the scene where Axel fights someone and they put a stunt double in, its totally obvious that it was LESTER from 227!!! hahaahahaha! have fun.
