Thank god it was a short movie.I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive. For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad writing/acting...they don't.Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an "Extended", "Super", "Ultimate", "Collectors" version of whatever movie at some point. I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your "Ultimate", "Platinum", "Gold", "Silver", "Special Anniversary" 3D, DVD , Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even then I will buy one version of your movie and no more. Oh, and Flixster.com/UltraViolet  sucks! If you see a movie with a digital UltraViolet copy don't buy it. If you give me a digital version of a movie, don't make visit a new site or make me register for a new service. I already have one and don't care about all of the other services. It's also not a real digital copy as much as streaming service so if you're not on a wifi connection you can't view your movie.
