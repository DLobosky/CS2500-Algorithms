This is my second Panasonic plasma TV - My first was the 54" S2 model without the internet apps or THX.  Both have an outstanding picture - frankly I don't understand why people think LCD TV are better than plasma - at least when it comes to picture quality.I bought this set in late August so it's been running for 3+ months.  When I bought the TV, Amazon was running a special that included the new Panasonic Skype add-on for free - the sound works great but I am waiting for the new Mac version of the Skype software that supports video.  I have connected a Tivo (with cable card), Apple TV and a Panasonic BluRay player.  Honestly, I hardly ever use the BluRay player as there is so much streaming content available today and the video quality is really very good.Back to the TV - I bought this TV to replace a 43" pioneer plasma that was a pre-HDMI, pre-1080p set so connectivity was becoming a problem plus I wanted to upgrade to 1080p.  the set-up was a snap - the Amazon delivery service was great.  They delivered it to our appointed room took it out of the box and confirmed the set was working - very nice.  The Viera Cast works well but I tend to use the Tivo to access Netflix simply because I tend to grab the Tivo remote out of habit plus it controls the TV without issue.I use the TV's speakers as they are fine - then again, I have never bothered with a home theater sound system - the TV is in our bedroom so the audio output is fine.Also, I have had none of the buzzing some people have experienced - in fact the quality on both Panasonic TV's has been great - knock on wood.Frankly, for the price the value is just amazing - this is a great TV and I am delighted with both Panasonic and Amazon.
