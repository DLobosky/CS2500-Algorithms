Abigail Padgett is one of today's best mystery writers, right up there with Laurie R. King (and that's high praise). &quot;Strawgirl&quot; is the second in her series about Bo Bradley, a manic-depressive investigator of  child-abuse cases. Sounds like a downer, but it's not. Ms. Padgett's  skillful, imaginative writing, ingenious plotting and complex  characterization make this fascinating reading, high on my list of  unputdownable books. Bo Bradley is a most admirable, courageous and likable  character, as is psychiatrist and cult researcher Eva Blindhawk Broussard,  who is introduced in &quot;Strawgirl.&quot; I hope the publisher will make  this book available again soon. I had to seek out a secondhand copy, and it  was well worth the effort.
