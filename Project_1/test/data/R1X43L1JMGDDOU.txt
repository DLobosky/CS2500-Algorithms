I bought this book after reading The Best American Spiritual Writing 2007. While all the pieces in these collections are well written and interesting, the 2007 edition had seven essays that left a strong impression on me, and this collection had two. A worthwhile read overall. If you only have time for one collection, though, I'd recommend the 2007.
