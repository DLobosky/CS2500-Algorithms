I actually had read in other reviews that this cable was a Category 1, but I figured since 1080i was the most I was going to be using it for, that it wouldn't be a problem. WRONG! Like several other reviewers, I too experienced an annoying flicker of the picture. It wasn't a constant problem, but it was just often enough to annoy me. I tried everything from jiggling cables to trying the other 3 HDMI ports on the tv. Nothing worked. I ordered the Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray for less than $10, and the annoying flicker magically disappeared. There is absolutely no reason you need to pay $50 or $100 on some overpriced cable, but you should definitely make sure the cable you get is a Category 2.
