Each is willing to give up anything to regain and then maintain youth.They get their wish.They stumble onto a lady with a magic formula. Just drink the potion and their bodies will not age another day. They readily agree before they learn the catch. Their bodies will not age because they will be dead. They will still be able to function and used their bodies, they just won't be alive.This youth comes with a problem. They are going to be with their bodies a long time so it is important to maintain them. Bruce Willis, the former plastic surgeon and now undertaker is needed for maintenance.This is a well done, if bizarre, comedy. The women are catty to the degree of hilarity. Nothing will stop their quest for beauty.
