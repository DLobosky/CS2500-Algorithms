I guess I could go back and give the others a 4 star rating if I was comparing the novels in the series but to me a 5 star rating is for any book that pulls me in so completely that I can not put it down and so far most of the books in this series have done that.As one of the reviewer for this series has stated, this series will remind you of the BDB series but with wings and I really love the Black Dagger Brotherhood books and this series was a very nice fit for my love of paranormal romances.The author does a fantastic job of pulling the reader in and never letting go with wonderful characters, credible world building, fast actions and originality.I won't recap the story as other reviewers have already done a very good job of that but this novel was so riveting that you would swear that the author used magic in writing the book.  You know that the protagonists are going to get their HEA but the reader can not imagine how in the heck it can be accomplished until reveled at the very end.  This keeps you reading page after page until the very last.This series contains all the following:- Great world building where I can picture it in my mind easily- Actions flow smoothly and keep me turning the pages- Characters that I become "attached" to and want to know what happens to them- HEA - I want and need a HEA- Heat factor - A graphic description of the sex act does not always turn me on but an explicit love making scene can.- Fully developed plot with strong Alpha male or malesAnother thing I loved about this series is that the characters that you have come to love are included in the next book in a way that does not leave the reader wondering what ever happened to them - it makes it feel more complete.  That is something that I miss in the BDB series where sometimes previous characters are barely referred to or have very little presence.WARNING - this series should be and needs to be read in order as the actions and characters flow from one to the next.
