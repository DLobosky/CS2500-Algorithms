The end result is 'Power, Corruption and Lies'; their best, most focussed, and most consistent album. And this re-release is generously augmented by a batch of non-album tracks from 1983-4, containing a couple of New Order's most groundbreaking and well-known singles. A classic album just got even better!Part of the reason for 'Power, Corruption And Lies' classic status is that there's really something for everyone here. About half of the album is dominated by the icy electronica that characterised their smash hit 'Blue Monday' ('5-8-6', 'Your Silent Face', 'Ultraviolence', 'Ecstacy'), but there are also nods to their Joy Division past on 'We All Stand' and 'Leave Me Alone', and to their poppier future on 'Age of Consent' and 'The Village'. The other big plus is the album's consistency; only on 'Technique' would the band again make an album this uniformally strong. No song sounds weak or out of place, and the musicianship and lyrics are some of the strongest in the New Order catalogue. Above all, the band sound confident and assured, which is a welcome sign after struggling for a few years to develop their own sound. Included in this 2-CD re-release is a disc containing the band's non-album singles from the period. 'Blue Monday' is obviously the standout, a defining track for both the band and the time, but there are plenty of other great tracks here; the hip-hop tinged 'Confusion', the synthpop-meets-blue-eyed-soul of 'Thieves Like Us', the pretty good pop/rock song 'Lonesome Tonight' and the intensely tribal 'Murder', with a couple of instrumental remixes rounding out the collection. These tracks are all worthy in their own right, but they also fit very well in the context of the rest of the PCL album. 'Thieves Like Us' and 'Lonesome Tonight' are especially valuable as a sort of bridge between this album and the follow-up 'Low-Life'.'Power Corruption and Lies' is a classic of its time, and one of (if not the) best New Order albums. An already strong album complemented by some of the band's best singles make this 2-CD collection an essential purchase, for die-hard and casual fans alike.
