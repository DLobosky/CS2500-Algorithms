I recently bought this with a couple of other pieces and I am very happy.  My non-stick pans gave out after only five years and I was looking for something a bit healthier for my family.  I was nervous to use cast iron on my glass top and I heard the maintenance was time consuming but these fears have proven to be unfounded.  As with any cookware, you should not drag it across a glass top stove and the clean up of the pre-seasoned cast iron is a breeze.  The biggest challenge I have is to use both hands while lifting and cleaning the cookware as it is quite heavy.  The biggest advantages of this piece are it is a large size and the lid works as a medium sized skillet - 2 pieces for the price of 1.  I am very happy with my switch to cast iron and would highly recommend this piece due to its versatility.
