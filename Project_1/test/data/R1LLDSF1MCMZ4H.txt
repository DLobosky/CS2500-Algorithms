This movie is real funny. If you are a South Park fan or someone who is not easily offended and looking for some laughs then rent this movie before you buy it. The movie is different than the tv show{which is good}. South Park is a lot better than Beavis and Butthead. If you like the movie try the tv show. The tv show uses both witty an toilet humor. About every episode is funny. I must admit that I am a fan of the tv show.
