It is the mother tounge after all (and although Dalrymple may have come to it late, he came to it with a relish), and they certainly can wield it well. Wry and dry and pulling no punches, Dalrymple reminds us (again and again and again), that culture isn't quite what it used to be and gives a slightly different take than most people do on why. The again and again and again part is the one weakness of the book, and why I give it four instead of five stars. It is a collection of essays, and while he or his editor try to vary them and they are all well written, you can't help but feel a bit bludgeoned by the negative worldview after a while. I mean, I live in the U.S. and we're hardly know for refined manners, but outside of a few pockets in large cities do I ever run into the day in day out callousness that Dalrymple describes. I'm certainly not saying that he imagines it, just that all that doom and gloom probably works better on a case by case basis. In a book form you begin to feel like Lot must've felt in Sodom and Gomorrah. Then I've never been to London, and for all I know it's full of godless heathen running amuck.   Secondly he is an eloquent and fine storyteller, and gives a very logical presentation of the facts. He always admits the anecdotal nature of his observations, but makes a very compelling case for their considerations nonetheless. It is a sociological masterpiece, in my opinion, and gets as close to the nub of some of the problems of modern western society as one can get without divine revelation. It's weakness, like the other work that I have read by him, is that it is basically a collection of editorials, and thus there is overlap and often a continual drumbeat of the same few themes. If I imagine reading 30 Maureen Dowd stories in a row, I can generate sympathy for the agony that the other side who have genuinely read through the book must feel. Even for a social conservative it can get a bit tedious, but by and large Dalrymple takes enough fresh perspectives and uses enough varying examples to support his contentions that this is mostly a minor complaint. In all, a very, very good analysis and as succinct and vivid a glimpse of the Thomas Hardy-like irony that has brought us to this point that one is likely to encounter.
