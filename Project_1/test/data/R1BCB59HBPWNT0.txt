This book has good code samples and covers a lot of Swing. Unfortunately instead of really covering all the detail of a very complex framework, the book stops halfway both figuratively and literally. Of the 806 pages, only 356 are really any use. The last half of the book is composed of poorly presented synopses of the packages. These 450 pages (except for a workable index) are a waste and should have been used to convey the detail missing in the first half. They contain no navigational aids; instead class and interface descriptions appear seemingly randomly according to obscure (to me) organizational principles. The book also lacks any guidance on style and patterns to use in constructing a Swing application; instead we are left to infer this from the code samples. This is a major oversight in my view because the packages have been designed with specific patterns in mind. It would have been a great service to include some material on that.I do not think the author put the same effort into this book as he did for Pure Java.
