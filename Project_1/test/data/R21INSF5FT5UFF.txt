I didn't realize there were stickers in the book when I purchased this, so that was a vey pleasant surprise for my daughter!  Nice, thick book that shes already had hours of fun with!  Worth the price, and I usually don't spend more than a buck or two on coloring books.  The Princesses alone make it worth it though!
