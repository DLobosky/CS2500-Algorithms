Jeremy asks why anybody would buy this car, when there are magnificent cars in this price range. He then hits the accelerator and it is clear. The Stig drives the car on a cold winter day. The guys go to the North and take over an art gallery. They try to set a record for attendance of 30,000 people. They have decided that car art could draw a lot of people. There are some funny moments in the opening segment (Jeremy gets shot between the legs with a paintball, its classic). The last 1/3 of the show is the conclusion. It's the usual clowning around.The news is centered on Christmas presents - this is the just before Christmas show. The guys have some pretty funny ideas for presents. Jenson Buttons, the 2009 F1 Champion, is the star in the reasonably priced car. He does a decent interview. His lap is in the wet and pretty exciting. Overall, kind of a funny episode, except - Where were the cars? It was pretty much filled with nonsense.
