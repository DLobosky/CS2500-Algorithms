The photography is breathtakking.  I think that with practice you can master the cookies, marzipan, gumpaste and fondant decorations in this book. Piping royal icing flowers is a bit more daunting.  I would suggest a class or video for royal and butter cream icing flowers, Wilton How to Make Icing Flowers DVD because they can be a bit tricky (at least for me.)  This book provides six basic recipes for cookies, cakes and frostings.  My hope is that you are purchasing the book for decorating ideas and instruction, not for the recipes.  The author's decorating syle is clean, but very elegant.  The book provides a strong decorating foundation -- you can use this as a springboard for your imagination.This is the perfect book if you want to make your first decorated cookies or petit fours.  If you are making your first tiered cake this book will provide inspiration, but you may need to supplement it with other sources for complete instruction.
