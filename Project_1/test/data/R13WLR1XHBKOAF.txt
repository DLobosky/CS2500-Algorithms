Generally I use synthetic water stones for knife sharpening but the DMT is often better for roughing in a bevel on a very dull or damaged knife.  First off the Dia-Sharp is a fast cutting stone, especially when it's new.  After using it for awhile it will "drop off" in speed and begin to cut more slowly, and leaving a finer polish as well.  This is normal and is the result of the wearing away of the very top layer of diamonds.  Once "broken in" the DMT-C cuts quickly and leaves a finer scratch pattern than you'd expect for a 320 grit "stone".  It's very easy to jump up to a 1k or even a good 2k water stone after the DMT.When compared to conventional synthetic water stones the Dia-Sharps have a couple of major advantages.  The first and most noteworthy is that they won't dish- ever.  Those of you who've seen the old-school "saddle shaped" Arkansas or India tri-stones can appreciate what I'm talking about.  The DMT will stay reference-flat for the life of the stone.  And my experience has been that the DMTs last for a good while.  My C has been used heavily for sharpening and for flattening other stones for 3+ years and while it's definitely showing some wear it's still going strong.  That leads me to the other advantage- it's flat enough out of the box and durable enough to use it to flatten your other stones.  The 320/C isn't fast enough to effectively flatten very coarse Aratos but it's fine for medium and fine grit stones.I think for the final polishing water stones leave a superior finish vs the DMTs, but the Dia-Sharps really shine when used in the coarser grits.  I'd hate to be without mine.
