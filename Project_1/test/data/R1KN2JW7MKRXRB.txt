I watched all 3 version of Persuasion .I thought after watching the 2007 I would enjoy watching the older version of Persuasion (1971 & 1995)too.But i was not impressed.It was kind of boring and shows no special effect how Anne and Frederick feel seeing each other after 8 years. The 2007 version of Persuasion is better.The Actors Anne (Sally Hawkins) and Frederick (Rupert Penry Jones)play the role fantastic.You can feelin every scene how Anne and Frederick feel seeing each other after 8 years .You wanna watch  Persuasion over and over again.I agree its not exactly like the book by Jane Austen,but most movies are not always based on a book.But I still think it is a better version of Persuasion.When you love Persuasion,you will enjoy watching this movie.
