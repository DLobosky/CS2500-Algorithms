I have a long history with music and audio but have never invested in anything other then $30.00 headphones.So,after researching customer reviews and visiting sites like Headroom-right between your ears,and testfreaks I couldn't decide between these Grados and Sennheiser HD280 pro.The Grados are open and the Sennheisers are closed.So,I got these from Amazon and a used pair of the Sennheisers from eBay for a great price.Both deliver undistorted sound and that intimate detail your looking for in headphones. .The Grados have a retro look like you might see in a  WWll movie,but their light weight and the cord is thick enough to not tangle like the earbuds that came with your iPod.By the way,the Grado's work just fine with the MP3 player.I get good volume levels with the volume set to 70% on my iPod.Understand that sound does leak in and out  of these but thats what open design means and how the designers get such wonderful sound. I can't imagine a better set of headphones for $69.00.
