Lewis (well-played by Kevin Whately) will never be as interesting and quirky a character as his old boss, but this first episode in a new series is very good. Even though it lacks the humor and wit of the Morse series, it is well done. Lewis is back as an inspector; Morse has been dead for five years, and Lewis is still grieving over the death of his wife in a hit-and-run.He has a dogsbody sergeant, a bag man now, the tall very bright, crossword-puzzle loving, ex-theologian Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox). Lewis's boss is a woman who doesn't think of much of him and wants to put him out to pasture, that is until he proves he's as good as his old boss at solving murders. There are three homicides in this one, and the plot is as complicated, labyrinthine, and convoluted as in the usual Morse outings.The scion of a car-making empire, Daniel Griffon, is a bright Oxford math student who goes to a sleep disorder clinic along with other students. They are wired up and studied for various sleep maladies. The head of the lab is very attractive, and there may be some future love interest between Lewis and the scientist. He's a widower and she's single. The screenwriter has put good chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway, and even though Hathaway is quite cerebral, Lewis seems to be much more astute on his own without the Morse genius breathing down his back. Hathaway is a good, but humorless character creation. It would be fun to team up Lewis with a Benny Hill type of character. Mysteries should be fun too. Inspector Gently has a confrontational, rather dodgy sergeant, and Inspector Foyle has two interesting assistants. In this one watch out for all those suspects running around in hoodies like homeboys. There are plenty of suspects, but as usual they have so many issues and there are so many cross-currents that the viewer is going to be in the dark most of the time.The photography is excellent, and the scenes of Oxford, the backs, the college quads and buildings like the Bodleian are stunning. We'd like a little more fun and witty by-play between inspector and sergeant, but there will never be another Morse.At this writing Colin Dexter (born 1930) is still alive, but Inspector Morse's interpreter, actor, John Thaw passed in 2002 at age sixty.
