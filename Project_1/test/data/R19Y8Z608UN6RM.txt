The girls are cut off from their home, country, and family, and they must learn how to survive on their own during the early 1800s.  As the girls grow into women, and become separated even from each other.   They were warned by their formidable grandmother to trust no emissary, because the rebels have dispatched assassins to kill the princesses, and thereby secure their hold over the country.  Each book in the trilogy traces the story of one sister.I could easily envision Disney remaking these fairy-tale stories into movies, minus the hot sex of course, so if you like historical romances involving royalty, I can recommend this trilogy.  These books are fluffy pieces of confection for the mind, and while they lack the intensity to truly shock and startle the reader, they will please that craving for a well-done fantasy where the outcome is already known.  Dodd does an excellent job setting up truly unique plots for each princess, so I never felt like I was reading a carbon copy of a previous story.  I also commend this trilogy for having a harmonious blend of romance, action, danger, and surprisingly gratifying sex, which kept me happily entertained on every page.  The second story, "The Barefoot Princess," follows the youngest sister, Amy, the most impetuous and hotheaded of the bunch.  After parting from Claire, Amy finds her way to a small isle off the coast of England called Summerwind.  The current Marquess of Northcliff, Jermyn Edmondson, has completely neglected the residents within his domain, and Amy decides to help the peasants by kidnapping their Marquess, holding him for ransom, and using the money to improve life on the isle.  All goes according to plan except for the ransom; Jermyn's Uncle refuses to spend a dime to save his hide, so now Amy's stuck with a handsome nobleman chained in her basement.  After a while, Jermyn doesn't want to get away, he just wants Amy.  Meanwhile, the Uncle is waiting on pins and needles to hear of Jermyn's death, and when it's not forthcoming, he starts plotting on his own.
