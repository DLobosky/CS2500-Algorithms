 Pro's: It, like all of the DVD's, is geared towards intermediate and advanced dancers.  The instruction is clear and concise, and as I stated on other DVD reviews of this series, gives a range of instruction on one DVD--in this case, hand veil, indo-fusion, and a more interpretive/lycrical like style of dance. At over 2 hours running time, great value for the money. The choreographies are not something I would have developed for myself, but there are aspects of each I liked and can interpret for my own usage.
 
 Cons:  Duing the performance of Naraya's piece, the camera work is a bit jumpy, and the lighting makes her face seem to lack expression, which I don't think at all is the case.
 
 The Nymph dance by Blanca is beautiful, somewhat stylized, using hand veils.  Hand veils is not commonly seen, and so I was very happy to see it taught here.  It, like all of the DVD's, is geared towards intermediate and advanced dancers.  Great teaching as well, and love the costume.  The dance is very fluid, lots of arms.
 
 Naraya performs the Salome piece, listed as Tribal Fusion but I did not see any of what I call Tribal Fusion in it, namely b/c of the "tribal" label.  Lyrical jazz kind of bellydance fusion, but not "tribal fusion." The dance is, out of the 3 DVD's, seemingly the simplest and most repetitive (as is the song) of the group.  Her teaching is clear, her costume is unique and very simply un-adorned but fits her very well.  At first, I was impartial to the piece and did not see how the name fits the performance, but the second time I watched it, I noticed subtle nuances.  I'd like to see more of her work.  The dance has more sharp movements, lunges, etc.
 
 Darshan was the tribal priestess in a tribal fusion piece, heavily Indian based.  I was so happy to see Indo-fusion here. Hand and wrist movements are emphasized here, and she teaches the head-veil dancing.
 
 Each dancer, by the way, gives the story behind the creation of the dance, which is a way to get a behind the scenes look at the creation of a dance as well as get inspired for ways to look at a song for your own choreography.
 
 This is my favorite out of the 3, but all are a great value b/c they all touch on a different arena--hand veils, Indo-fusion, tribal fusion, isolations, fluidity, wings, etc.  However, of all, this has the performances I was most drawn to.  As with any choreography DVD, I found aspects I would use in my own dance, although the entire choreos did not suit me--but isn't that the point of learning steps? To take what you can use and make it your own?  Great DVD.
