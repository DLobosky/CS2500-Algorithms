The novel is set in the city of Kisangani, on the Congo River in Congo (formerly the Zaire river in Zaire) -- though interestingly, the author never says this explicitly.  I have never seen an account as to what Naipaul's experiences in Zaire were exactly, but he manages to tell the story of the early days of Zaire's independence, after colonial rule as the Belgian Congo. The protagonist is a young Indian from the Eastern coast.  (&quot;Indian&quot; in the sense of his ethnicity, his family has been in Africa longer than they can remember.)  He has purchased a shop in Kisangani, and trys to build up his business as the &quot;big man&quot; consolidates power in the newly independent country.  Things go from bad to worse, for the new shopkeeper and the country.  Though this is fiction, every word is true.   Naipaul writes beautifully, and has many insights into Africa, colonialism, history, and life.  This is one of the few books that I have read and enjoyed more than once.Some people recommend Chinua Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; to readers looking for an &quot;African&quot; novel.  But to recommend &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; over &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; makes sense only if you can read just a single book about Africa. Achebe's novel is set in Nigeria; Naipaul's is about Zaire. It's like saying don't bother with &quot;Brothers Karamozov&quot;, read &quot;Great Expectations&quot; instead. I should hope a serious reader would turn his attention to both.(The last days of the Belgian Congo is the setting for Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;. Many good nonfiction stories from this time and place are found in &quot;A Doctor's Life: Unique Stories&quot; by William T. Close.  A literary approach to the early days of the Belgian Congo is Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.)
