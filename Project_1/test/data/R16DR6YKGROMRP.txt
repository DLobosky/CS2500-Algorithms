Oh sure there are pretty pictures and statues, but so what.  Right?So why was a particular work of art done?  What did it feel like to create that artwork?Here the child is 1st introduced to an artist (22 in all).  From child easy Calder, Okeeffe, Klee, Kandinsky to heavyweights like Whistler, van Gigh, Turner, Pollock (a deliberate mess?).  Your child learns alittle about the artist, their time, and what their type of expression was about.Then you do an art project inspired by that artist using various media = giftwrap, felt pens, paint, foil, forks $ straws etc.Example: you read about a famous water lily painting built up out of layers of paint (guess who).  Then you make your own lily picture using layers of colored tissue paper.  Our child's version turned out pretty good.  Made her proud and she can recognize a Monet a mile away.  If only math was this fun!
