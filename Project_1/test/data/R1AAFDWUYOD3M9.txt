I like that the baby becomes a focus of the decision.This easy-to-read Christian fiction is not just for young adults; this senior citizen enjoyed reading it. In addition to looking closely at an edgy problem, romance blooms, bringing a roller coaster of emotions. Although it is the second in the series, it can be read without having read the first title, It's Not About Me. Discussion questions are included.
