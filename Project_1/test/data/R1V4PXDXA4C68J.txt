There's no sound, but enough character generation for me to discern the topic of the show is three books:  "The Survivors Club; The Secrets and Science that Could Save Your Life" by Ben Sherwood, "The Age of the Unthinkable; Why the New World Disorder Constantly Surprises Us and What We Can Do About It" by Joshua Cooper Ramo, and this book.  Beck is claiming that many are referring to these tomes as a trilogy.  After reading all three, I fail to make the connection, but I suppose a trilogy could even be comprised of "Moby Dick," "Huckleberry Finn," and "Peyton Place."  Although I enjoyed reading all three books discussed by Beck and the authors, "America's Prophet" was probably my least favorite.  If you know the story of Moses in any detail, a good deal of the book will just rehash what you already know.  Also, if you are a student of current events, the last few chapters will seem endless.  However, there are sections of this book I found riveting, mostly those pages dealing with the founding of our nation and the recurring influence of this Biblical giant.  You will learn things here you never learned in school.  And you will unlearn things you learned in school, such as what really is the story behind Philadelphia's Liberty Bell, that the Statue of Liberty and Superman are both created from the image of Moses, and his influence on Lincoln and the Underground Railroad, Presidents Washington, Reagan, and Obama are strong.  Has Moses lost his place in American history because of separation of Church and State?  One might think so, especially after reading this book and learning how much of a factor Moses played in America's development.
