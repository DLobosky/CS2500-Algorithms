Having recently returned from a two week golf trip to Scotland, I find myself even more deeply interested in the history and people of that country.This is a very good, broad and comprehensive treatment of Scottish history and personages from the earliest time through the present.  Much of what is written is seen through the prism of English history, as the two are necessarily intertwined.  A few complaints, however.The author routinely identifies places and monuments through reference to highway numbers.  At times, the history reads like a travelogue.  While this is undeniably helpful to Scottish readers who wish to visit those sites, the failure to include good maps leaves one wondering.More disconcerting is the author's insistence on rehabilitating virtually every historical personage of Scottish importance.  To believe the author, almost every Scottish leader was a swell guy who has been mistreated by history.  The phrase, "Recent research has painted a far more (a)sympathetic, (b)complimentary, (c)positive portrait of xxxxxxxxx than previously thought" appears over and over again as Magnusson goes about his job of rehabilitating previously poorly thought of leaders and Kings.  Seriously, some of those fellows were probably just bad Kings.  Deal with it.  Having said that, I find Scottish genealogy far easier to follow than the rat's nest that was Medieval and Renaissance English royal politics.  Trying to decipher the in-breeding and marriage alliances involved in the War of the Roses can cross your eyes, whereas James I begat James II, who begat James III, who begat James IV, who begat James V, who begat Mary (uh-oh).  Of course, the near constant turmoil and political infighting only increased exponentially with the Reformation and introduction of religious strife to the region.  To read the record, the 16th and 17th centuries were consumed with constant intrigue and rebellion, more often as not, focusing on the tug of war between royalty dominated Episcopalianism and church (and individual) led Presbyterianism (and forget about the poor stray Catholic that may be periodically drawn and quartered).All in all, a very educational and time worthy effort for anyone curious about the development of Scotland as an independent nation and the historical personages that played a role in that process, both inside and outside the country.
