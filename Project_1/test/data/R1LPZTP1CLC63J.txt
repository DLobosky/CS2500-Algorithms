I just finished reading the book and found it well written and thought-provoking. Each chapter is laid out in well-organized manner and the narrative flows nicely from start to finish. The material has the  potential to be very dry, yet the author manages to sustain reader interest  throughout the book.While readers will doubtlessly disagree with many of  the ideas that the author puts forth, they are presented with great clarity  and style. Like any well-written book, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;  stimulates reflection upon the nature of mankind and the development of  societies around the world. I am surprised at some of the reviews which  put forth the notion that the book is somehow &quot;anti-Western  Civilization.&quot;  As a student of history, I believe that one can learn  from many different perspectives and the examination of different societies  is not &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;anti&quot; anything.  The book presents a  lot of food for thought which the reader should find illuminating.
