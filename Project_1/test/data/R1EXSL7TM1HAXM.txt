When I read the blurb I read; a bodyguard, a rock star and a killer stalker, I assumed action, action, action and oh yeah, suspense. This book has very little actual suspense and action, unless you count the bedroom scenes and then it is VERY action packed. Whew - steamy!!Erin Montgomery is battling to move on with her life after a traumatic incident during her job. She has been on leave from her DEA job for a year and is still plagued by gut wrenching nightmares. She has no desire to return to work. Her ex-partner calls her regarding a mission only she can help him with and she cannot refuse him. A sense of responsibility and duty draws her back into undercover work. Erin must protect the man that as a boy, laid down his life for her.Hard rocker Sean Ledger has a major problem. He has a stalker that is getting more and more dangerous. After trying to ignore the situation for the last year, he turns to his adoptive brother to help him with his problem. He has always been a love them and leave them kind of guy. He believes that is what got him into this predicament in the first place. He is ready to give up his hedonistic ways, only if his body would listen to him. In walks trouble in skin tight leather and revealing top. Sean is instantly attracted to Erin; problem is he has a policy of not "dipping where he works".These two characters have a past together. Erin knows who Sean is, but he doesn't remember her. She has changed a lot over the years, becoming a strong independent woman with a new name and identity. She is completely opposite from the child he once protected. Sean is confused over his protective feelings for Erin. He is drawn to her in a way he has only experienced once in his life. To a frightened little girl who had no one but him to defend her.Love and Protect is a hot romantic tale of two people in love. I can't really say falling in love, because they have loved each other since the moment they met so many years ago, they just didn't know it. This is a sweet discovery of soul mates. Meant to be together from the start, their bittersweet separation and the enchanting discovery of love found again.Pick up a copy of Love and Protect for a different take on romance. This is a sizzling book of a couple struggling to heal from their pasts and to find love in the world of rock and roll; where they play hard, but love even harder.
