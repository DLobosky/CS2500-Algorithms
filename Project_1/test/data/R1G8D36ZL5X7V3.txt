I bought this very inexpensive VHS because I am a teacher. One of my students lost the school's VHS movie after I checked the library's copy out. I got a notice to return the movie or pay $25. OH HECK NO! I got this movie for little 'o' nuttin' from Amazon (or whoever), took it to the librarian and she just put her numbers on it and I was off the hook. Its a good movie.
