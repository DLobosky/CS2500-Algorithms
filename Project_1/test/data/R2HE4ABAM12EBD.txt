There are relatively few changes in this later edition so my reviews of both editions are closely matched.This is a relatively short, about 250 page, book. Within that limited space, and in six chapters, it provides a review of basic pre-calculus topics followed by: Functions, Limits, and Continuity; Derivatives; Applications of Derivatives; Integrals; Applications of Integration, and an Index.Topics are presented quite concisely, e.g., 'Related Rates' is covered in about seven pages, and 'Approximating Area' in four. However, the text is quite well-written, and in this case the brevity is an advantage, allowing readers to quickly gain an understanding of the first semester calculus core. In text problems are provided for readers to work as each new topic is presented. These problems are provided with fully-worked solutions.This edition includes some additional end of chapter problems. For example, in the first edition the Chapter on "Applications of Derivatives" ended with 19 practice exercises, the second ends with 22. However, as with the first edition, only answers, not fully worked solutions, are provided for these end of chapter "Test Yourself" exercises.However, there is a serious problem with this edition. The majority of text here was retyped from the first edition. Unfortunately, during that retyping, some errors not present in the earlier edition were unintentionally introduced into this edition. For example, in the section on inequalities, a greater than or equal sign appears here instead of the appropriate less than or equal sign shown in the first edition. In another problem, solution space end points correct in the first edition are inadvertently changed to incorrect values in this edition, and a required solution graph present in the first edition is missing in this edition, etc.  Considering the relatively large number of errors introduced in this second edition, albeit with some modest improvements and expansions, the first edition is definitely worth considering. At the time of this review a new copy of the first edition was selling for more than a new copy the second edition. However, with its smaller format and fewer errors, even at its increased price, the first edition may well be a better overall value.
