Even the one funkish tune, Sweet Dreams, is nowhere near what the Crusaders were able to do on earlier records, despite a Larry Carlton solo (far from his best). Everything is over-produced, polished to a fault, and lacking any soul or grit that I can discern. Easily the weakest Crusaders album I've ever heard, of about ten. With so many unheard albums out there, I doubt I'll ever hear this again, and someone will get a used record played all of twice. Hope they don't pay more than 25 cents.
