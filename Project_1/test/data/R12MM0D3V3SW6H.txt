Visage is a pretty cool band.  Their musicianship and songwriting skills are good.  This hits package is listenable and satisfying.  There's a total of twelve tracks, and all of them are in a synth-pop musical direction.  The singer does a nice job with the vocal duties, and the keyboards sound tight.  All of the tracks are pretty good.  My favorite songs are both versions of &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; and &quot;Love Glove.&quot;  The CD booklet also contains a biography of the band.  Worth a listen.
