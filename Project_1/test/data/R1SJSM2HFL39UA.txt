This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have  to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of  "The Klansman." Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was  awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville, California and promptly proposed to  an 18 year Denny's waitress. His costar, Lee Marvin, was also drinking a  bottle a day. Neither was sober for a single syllable of this terrible  movie and their struggles to appear sober make for some hilarious  moments.Burton, as usual, dreadfully overacts and his attempts at a  Southern accent are pitiful, to say the least. Marvin's acting is much  better, but when he has to speak inane lines from a miserable script, he  can't fare much better.This is a great movie to watch with a couple of  beers. If you appreciate a terrible script, crude sets and two major stars  who were drunk out of their minds while filming, you'll love this one.
