With this tome Popoff has hit the decade where the number of hard rock and heavy music releases started to spiral upwards. As such the book is not as complete as per the volume on the Seventies appeared to be even though this one has more than twice the reviews. Popoff comes across to me as a completist - one of those retentive fans that just wants to include the lot. And for that I salute him and I can imagine the pain he went through not being able to cover even albums he knew belonged in here due to space and time limitations.Having said that basically everything that is important is here. Popoff doesn't have much time for live albums and that's fair enough, though he is willing to cover a few salient items. Nor does he give much truck to greatest hits compilations unless they pique his interest for some reason. And given the number of times greatest hits selections are put out with little track listing variation by some bands that's a totally justifiable position to take. One difference apparent in this volume is that while there is still a score out of ten for each release the heaviness quotient - a score out of ten for heaviness - which the author utilised in his 70's book has been discontinued. Personally I don't really miss it as I have albums from throughout the hard `n' heavy spectrum in my collection, so just a description of the music will do me just fine thanks.In terms of his musical opinions, this is a guy who has carved himself a career in music built on sheer passion - I may not agree with each and every review of his but for petes sake who would? While some of his reviewing tendencies have been justly pointed out (he isn't much for punk or hardcore or some of the more extreme metal alloys) to me the idea that your going to pick up a book like this and react angrily if one of your pet bands is rated poorly is pretty childish. Just scroll through some of the less flattering reviews and you'll find people whimpering that this album or that album scored badly. Get over it! Personally I love to have a chuckle when he rubbishes one of my pet bands, I often muse to myself that yes.... that particular album does indeed suck but hey, I like it and darn it all, I'm gonna put it on! I should note that Popoff won't be winning a Pulitzer or whatever anytime soon but it's the guys knowledge and passion and irreverent attitudes that I buy his books for. That and they are a useful guide for finding out about bands that may have been before my time or passed me by upon release. And they are handy reference guides to have lying on your shelf.I really must say I enjoyed this book, last I checked there was talk of releasing the books for the 70's, 80's and 90's as a box set. If so I'd love to see the books revised - he managed to produce a book of 520 pages for the 90's which is almost 90 more than he had for this one. In a perfect world I'd love to see his opinions on some of the stuff he didn't have time to put in here. And I'm sure since putting it out we punters have let him know of other bands that should have been put in both this tome and his 70's book. For a revised edition, I'd buy this again. Get reading.
