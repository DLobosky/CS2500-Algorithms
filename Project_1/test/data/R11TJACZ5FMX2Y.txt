But what if life came from outer space and you know, hung around Earth for a while and interacted with humans?  And what if said life was housed in a concentration camp?  And said life had an affinity for cat food, rubber, and violence?  And said life was intelligent enough to master intergalactic travel yet savage enough to eat raw human flesh?  Such is the premise of District 9 (2009).         Story-Line      District 9 opens over the clear blue sky of Johannesburg, South Africa as several people narrate the story of how the alien creature referred to as "prawns," came to the planet and get stranded here. For months nothing is heard from the hovering ship and finally the powers to be cut into the ship and find up to 1 million "prawns" starving and feeding off one another and evacuate them to the surface and fence them off in an area called District 9.    The protagonist in the violent and bloody little tale is one Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a mid-level manager who works for the Multi National United (MNU) who has been given the unforgivable task of clearing out District 9 and relocating the extraterrestrials to a newer district with tents.  District 9 has become a cesspool wherein the visiting aliens live off each other and human cast-off's.  Nigerian gangs have been allowed to move in and prey off the aliens running black market prostitution and collecting for themselves alien bio-weaponry that can only be fired by the extraterrestrials.  So the Nigerians have introduced voodoo and mysticism forwarding the premise that eating Prawn flesh will allow access to the weapons.    While searching one house Wikus Van De Merwe happens upon a black vile which he stupidly opens and it splashes a black liquid into this face.  And over the next 72 hours he changes as the alien DNA supplants his own and he slowly "turns" into a prawn left hand first.  Meanwhile Wikus Van De Merwe's wife Tania Van De Merwe (Vanessa Haywood) is the traumatized wife.     My ThoughtsDistrict 9 is certainly a different kind of SciFi movie, one that ultimately leaves a multitude of questions in is bloody wake.  Chief among these is why the extraterrestrials came to Earth in the first place?  Were they bent on conquest and something happen?   The movie hints that they ran out of fuel, but they demonstrated the ability to make more, so...Second question: with no fuel to run the ship, how was it able to hover above Johannesburg?  Third question: why were these seemingly advanced species content to stay within the confines of District 9.  With their advanced weaponry and obvious intellect, they could have easily have taken over the city, so...Questions aside, I did enjoy District 9.  Sharlto Copley did a stellar job portraying the naïve bureaucrat who while showing an admirable understanding of the aliens, even speaking their language, nonetheless demonstrated little respect for them.  As he begins morphing into one of the prawns, and is discovered by the evil heads of MUN, who seek to dissect him (for their own greedy desires of course), Wikus Van De Merwe has to go on the run eventually ending up in District 9.  His transformation from clueless desk-jockey to battle-hardened half human is intriguing to watch because he does such a great job.The metaphors this movie introduces are so obvious I need not point them out, sufficed to say District 9 pulls no punches when it comes to the portrayal of naked racism and violence directed toward our extraterrestrials visitors.  And did I mention exploitation?  By the end of most science fiction movies I feel largely disconnected from the story, probably because the action takes place in a land far, far away.   With District 9 I did experience that same disconnectedness and that's the point the movie is supposed to leave the audience winded, shaken and thinking about our supposed humanity.
