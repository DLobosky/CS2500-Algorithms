I bought my LG500G today at Walgreens for $29.99.  I wanted to upgrade from my LG420G flip-phone.  The 500G does have some better features, but it is basically the same as the 420G.I activated by phone and it took an entire hour from the time I called until the phone activated and assigned a telephone number. But, it did go through without any problems.The 500G QWERTY keypad is an upgrade from the 420G.  It makes texting a LOT quicker.  The 500G screen is a little larger than the 420G.  Also, the 500G has a video camera while the 420G has only a still camera. The 500G is longer than the 420G when the 420G is closed up and the 420G is thicker than the 500G when the 420G is closed up.  The email and Internet capabilities seem about equal on the 2 phones.  The menu seems to be the same.  Like the 420G, the 500G has only one ringtone unless you buy more.I had only had the 500G activated for about 10 minutes when I lost my first .5 minute due to accidentally hitting the browser button.  As many other reviewers have said, that seems to be a big problem with the 500G. The 500G keypad is small but that has not been a problem so far.I don't text much, so I will continue to use my 420G as my main "carry phone" and use the 500G as a backup.  The more compact size of the 420G makes it much easier to carry and there are no worries about accidentally turning on the browser, as other reviewers have mentioned.If you text quite a bit, the 500G is the phone for you.  However, if you don't text much, I think the 420G is the better buy. Also, when I got the 500G at Walgreens today, I noticed they had the 420G on sale for only $9.99.  That is really a good buy for the money.
