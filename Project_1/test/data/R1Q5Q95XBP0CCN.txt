The God's Word Translation is very easy to understand and read.    The Promises of Comfort booklet  gives you many sections to look into. Some of them are Afraid, Childless, Lonely, Tempted and Waiting to name just a few. Each section has many, many Bible verses to help you in this area.    This  booklet can be carried anywhere and everywhere. It is very handy and offer a wealth of information that can be read over and over. This  booklet has a very colorful cover and the handy size makes it a great booklet for yourself or as a gift. It would be a gift that is very much appreciated. I would recommend it very much.  Given to me from BakerBooks for review purposes.
