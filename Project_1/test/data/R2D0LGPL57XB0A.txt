"Night Passage" shows how Jesse Stone leaves his old job and becomes Chief of Police of Paradise.  Although, each movie can stand on it's own, it may help to watch in the order of events.  Why the studios made and released them the way they did....who knows!  I wont spoil the plot but Tom Selleck plays an excellent chief of police with his take no sh@@ from criminals attitude.
