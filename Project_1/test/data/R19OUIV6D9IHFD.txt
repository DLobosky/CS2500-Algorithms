If you enjoy amusing books written in a serious fashion about the mythical monsters we love to scare yourselves with, then this is a great book.  This is not from the same publisher of other "survival guides" that I have given to my partner but he returned the favor by giving me this.  The book is on task and on topic from the beginning through to the end.  Tackling questions of survival focusing on being against not with the vampires though there are some warnings about hooking up or wanting to join their ranks.Written with a thought to economics, fighting, disease spread, and cultural changes, it imagines a world overturned for several months by a vampire uprising.  However, that idea that such an uprising would occur and why is the weakest part of the book, threatening to undermine it so I deducted a star from my rating.  If you can buy the premise, just go with it, then you can have fun reading this book.
