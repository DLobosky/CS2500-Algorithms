&quot;The Terminator&quot; is one of James Camerons earlier films, and one can say his earlier movies were more &quot;personal.&quot; The Terminator is a masterpeice on film, especially considering the incredible low budget it was filmed on, $6 million. The special effects can't hold a candle to the sequel, but the story is stronger here, and the characters are more easily identified with. Here is the basic plot (although I don't want to say too much). In the future, a supercomputer starts a nuclear war to destroy mankind. The resistance is led by John Connor, so the computer sends the Terminator (arnold) back in time to kill Johns mother before he is even conceived. The John from the future sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother. Arnold is perfect in his role, even though his screen time and his lines are limited, his impression is easily made. The acting here is superb, and the mood of the relentless killing machine makes this an incredibly thrilling movie to watch. The chase scenes are incredible, as well as the other action segments, including the ever famous police station shoot-out (I'll be back...). But along with the great action is the whole mood of this film, especially the relationship formed between Sarah and Kyle (resulting in a suprising plot twist that you'll have to watch the movie to find out). You connect with these two people, and feel their emotions, their fear; and that element is perfectly combined with the thrilling suspense of the story. Also thown in is a little bit of black comedy to lighten the veiwer from the intensity of the film (including one scene cut from TV. For years I only watched the copy I taped off of TV, when I saw this one scene after I finally bought the tape, I laughed for minutes on end).I don't own this movie on DVD, but from what I've read the sound is supposed to be fairly poor. In my opinion, though, this film is so good that even if the sound doesn't take full advantage of the DVD system, it is still an incredible movie experience nonetheless. I first saw this movie when I was 11 years old (I'm 16 now), and since then it has been my favorite. If you enjoy this movie, I suggest these movies as well, and vice-versa. Aliens, Terminator 2, The Matrix, Blade Runner.
