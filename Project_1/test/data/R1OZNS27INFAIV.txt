"The Mask of Cthulhu" is a collection of a handful of Lovecraftian short stories written and published in the 1940s and 1950s, and is easily the stronger of the two books. Since all the stories in "Mask" were previously published in magazines such as "Weird Tales" you'd be right in assuming they pack quite a punch and are satisfying atmospheric fiction. There are three standout stories here:"The Return of Hastur" in which the contents of a last will are not properly honored. "Something in Wood" in which we're presented with a mysterious miniature idol. "The House in the Valley" in which an artist in a secluded house descends into madness. The novel "The Trail of Cthulhu," on the other hand, is pretty disappointing. Most of the chapters in the book were originally published as short stories, which in itself isn't always a bad thing. But despite a promising setup - each chapter is "authored" by the latest assistant of an occult investigator named Dr. Shrewsbury - the stories themselves are anticlimatic, repetitious, and often dull in the extreme. It's difficult to distinguish the lead characters from one another, and the various villains throughout are defeated far too easily. The cookie-cutter approach not only robs the overarching story of what drama it has, but also weakens the contents of the individual chapters. When characters are given powerful talismans as protection and can summon magical beings to whisk them away from danger in every single chapter, it's hard to feel any suspense.(It's here that Derleth also repeatedly editorializes regarding the Lovecraftian Mythos and conceives of them as an elaboration of pre-Adamic history from Christian theology, which is radically at odds with how Lovecraft himself presented the Mythos in stories such as "At The Mountains of Madness" and "The Call of Cthulhu." It's also at odds with how the horrors in the chapters are portrayed, because there's almost no evidence of any active and beneficial supernatural powers at work here. To be fair, Derleth does similar sermonizing in "Mask of Cthulhu" but because those stories are far more varied it isn't as noticable.) "Mask" is strongly recommended for anyone who enjoyed "Lurker at the Threshold" or "Watchers in the Dark." "Trail," on the other hand, is only recommended for diehard Derleth fans. Still, since neither book is currently in print alone, this compilation is the only way to get a fresh copy of either book."
