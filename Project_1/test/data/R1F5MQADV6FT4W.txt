This book will be valuable for anyone interested in learning more about the state of Tennessee. Mr. Shoulders takes the reader from Beale Street to the Trail of Tears. The neat thing is that the rhyming verse will be enjoyed by toddlers, but people of all ages will appreciate the information in the sidebars. The illustrations are very good, especailly those dealing with nature. I highly recommend this book.
