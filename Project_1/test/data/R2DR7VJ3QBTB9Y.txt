For the additional thirty dollars, this item includes:* A small antenna.* The Avermedia PVR software.* The proprietary composite input cable.If you have Windows Media Center or something like MythTV, then you don't need the Avermedia PVR software.  You also don't need the H.264 encoder because like Handbrake.fr is better.
