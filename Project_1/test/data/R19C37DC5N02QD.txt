I have had this book for several years now. All I can say is this is an awesome cookbook.... If I need something and don't have anyone to ask, I go to this cook book...I can not believe all of the information it has in this book... I am going to buy some for gifts, for friends and my children. This is an awesome book to own and give away! I just wish that I had came across this book sooner.... I even have the better homes and garden gardening book! It is so awesome! Thanks Better Homes And Gardens!
