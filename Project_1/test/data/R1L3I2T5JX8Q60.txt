American Shinx is a welcome addition to the many books written about our complex third president and founding father.  So many biographies are filled with exasperating detail; I found this to be a welcome change. Mr.  Elias presents a nice account of Mr. Jefferson's character without  inundating the reader with so much information that &quot;fatigue&quot;  sets in. Most early biographies of Jefferson elevate his life and status  to that of a near-God, perfect and flawless.  More recently, biographies  have presented Jefferson as a politically incorrect lecherous exploitative  individual, shallow and superficial.  This book presents Jefferson in a  balanced perspective, neither elevating him to divine status nor  castigating him for his human failings.  This is an excellent commentary on  the life of a man shaped by his times.
