This was clearly the best one for GuatemalaI bought this guide and another before my trip to guatemala.  This one was very interesting to read, it was organized effectively, and it had lots of recommendations for hotels and such.  The other travel guide I bought had only 6 recommended hotels for all of Guatemala City -the largest city in Central America!  I realized that GC is not a tourist destination, but we needed somewhere to stay before we took an early flight to Tikal.  This book listed hotels by city zones and even had a section for airport hotels.  There was an excellent section in the back about food, customs and etiquette, and dress.  This is an excellent guide packed with useful information.  Happy trails!
