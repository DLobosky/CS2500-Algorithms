I've tried the cheap ones that come with ipod, zune, creative, etc.  I've owned the midlevel Zune headphones.  I've owned some Sony ones.  I just recently bought the JVC HAFX34B Marshmallow Headphones too.  I was just amazed at the comfort for these.  my ear holes must be smaller than a lot of people because most earphones are annoyingly big to me.  When i first looked at these, I thought what a strange design but it works.  there is very little pressure on my ear canal like with the others.the next thing is the cord is nice and long and they packaged it correctly.  No kinks in the wire.  It doesn't look like you're wearing a wrinkled shirt with these earphones.  The cord is nice and long.it also comes with a okay drawstring pouch.  good so I don't have to worry about wrapping the wire and bending it.However, the most important aspect of earphones is the sound.  and that's where I'm mixed about these.  the sound is somewhat muddled with these.  i have to set the equalizer to enhance the treble with these.  the annoying part is having to constantly switch the settings based on which earphones I plug in.  For example, when I plug in the aforementioned JVC HAFX34B Marshmallow Headphones, I have to enhance the base with those earphones.If your experience in earphones is limited, then I think you'll like the sound of these.  They're much better than some of the cheap brands or cheap models that come with ipod.  I did adapt to the sound of these after using them for awhile.  but then when I switched to other brands I have, I kept thinking, wow, these Panasonic ones sound bland.
