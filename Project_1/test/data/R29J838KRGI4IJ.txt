My tanning salon sells only devoted creations.  I bought a sample of this the other day and it didnt smell all that great beforehand but i wanted to like it since it is boasted to be great..   After tanning i still didnt care for it.  I will not be buying a bottle of this.  After testing this out and a couple others..and a full bottle of extreme situation (smells great) i will be going back to designer skin.  more results.
