It does indeed. It's not an Oscar drama film nor was it ever supposed to be, so play down this argument if you ever happen to hear one. Most likely, however, you'll hear compliments to the creators for a really outstanding job, for creating what has been considered by many as &quot;the ultimate sci/fi movie&quot; before, but that sadly could hardly be ever seen. You know what a good movie should be like, you can feel it, but all movies that intend to be it usually fail and only few get to achieve this state of near perfection. These few are remembered and referenced for a very long time and Matrix is one such movie in its genre. Chances of you liking it? - 99%, leaving that 1% for somewhat twisted people who like that nobody likes and hate what everyone likes.
