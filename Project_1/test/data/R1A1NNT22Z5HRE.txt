I think master Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of this movie.  &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is perhaps the most thrilling movie of the last decade.  Director M. Night Shyamalan presents us the story of little Cole Sear (beautifully played by Haley Joel Osment), a child with an unusual -and definitely scary -ability of seeing dead people that refuse to accept they are not along the living anymore.  As psychologist Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis portrays someone who goes beyond his &quot;Die Hard&quot; character.  The relation between these two is the strength of this film.And I say that Hitchcock would have been proud of this movie because the twist at the end of the movie is something he would have probably made.  Bravo for Mr. Shyamalan.  But watch it!  Don't let anybody tell you how this film ends.  Enjoy.
