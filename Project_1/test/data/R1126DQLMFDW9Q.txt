It also feels small in your hand to the point where I'd be worried that my hand will slip forward onto the blade if any forward pressure was exerted.  The aluminum handle is slippery even when dry.  The belt clip is useless and I removed it immediately.  I had the tiny Torx driver necessary to remove the belt clip but the bolts stripped so I just pried the handle up until the screws ripped out of the soft aluminum body.The protrusion from the back of the knife's blade isn't intended to open the knife; rather, it's to prevent your hand from slipping forward when the knife is open.If this is in your price range, it's an OK choice; but, I'd recommend something beefier with a non-slip handle if you can find it.  I carry the little one and am satisfied enough.
