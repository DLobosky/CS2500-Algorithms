Her grandmother's last plea was that Schuyler find her grandfather so that he could save the blue bloods from the Croatan, or Silver Blood. He is the only one who truly believes that the Silver Bloods are alive. Schuyler and Oliver travel to Vienna to find the infamous Lawrence, but what they find is a man who does not want to come back to a group that shunned his ideas and cast him out. Schuyler decides that maybe the Silver Bloods are not back and it was all the delusional ideas of her grandmother after all. Schuyler attends a masquerade ball in the hopes of seeing her secret crush, Jack Force. What she finds is a mysterious masked man who takes her breath away. Bliss Llewellyn has never given up hope that Dylan, her love is still alive. Everyone thinks that he was turned by a Silver Blood or was the Silver Blood but Bliss knows deep in her heart that it was not the truth. When Bliss attends the 400 Ball her father gives her a huge Emerald necklace. He tells her it was her mother's and it is an emerald that fell from Lucifer him self's crown. Bliss has a unique attraction to it but surely her mother could never own something so evil right? Who is her mother anyways? And how did she die? MASQUERADE is the second installment in the Blue Bloods series. The story picks up a mere few weeks after the end of Blue Bloods and is just as action packed. Schuyler is coming into her character quite nicely. She is not afraid to dig a little deeper. The only part of Schuyler's character I do not like is how distracted she gets from the big picture. She knows there is a serious problem and that the Silver Bloods are roaming free yet she seems to forget everything when she is around Jack. I loved the progress that the story made. The ending made me run out immediately to buy the third book, which I devoured in one sitting also. MASQUERADE is a book that is not to be missed, but Blue Bloods really should be read first for the story to be fully understood.Melissa De La Cruz is the author of the Ashleys series, the Au Pairs series and now the new Blue Bloods series.
