"The curvature of space-time is called gavity. It is part of the dance, the process of creation."Though gravity may be thought of as this way, this is Chopra's wishful thinking. Do mankind really know much about gravity is?(Feyman says we can describe gravity but we don't know what it is.) How does dance and gravity make for creation?"The Unified Field is the ground state of all there is. It is the potentiality for space time and space-time events"How can mankind know that there is an Unified Field if he is within and part of it? Is it possible to know of a totality (Unified Field) if one is part of it?  Even if there is a Spirit (which I think there is), are Men able to discover the Spirit or the Unfied Field so that, as Chopra says, "the Spirit and the Unified Field are One".  That is, if we cannot know what the Unified Field is, and the Vedic sages say that the Spirit can not be known or described, how does Chopra know that the Unified Field and the Spirit are one?Why would we believe that the Spirit in the Unified Field exist in dimensions that Man even are aware of?  That is, if space and time are four dimensions, are there other dimensions still?  Why does anyone believe that the Spirit operates in dimensions we are aware of?  Only a hundred years ago, scientists thought Newtonian laws explained it all.  How soon before quantum mechanics be dethroned?I don't understand how Chopra can claim to describe It, when It has been described as undescribable by the sages.The problems go on and on.... This book is an exercise in creativity, without having thought through the implications thorougly.
