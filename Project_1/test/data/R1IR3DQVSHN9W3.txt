However, it is full of interesting facts that any cat owner would find interesting.It is consists of 2-3 page sections organized by subject.  It addresses questions like, why cats purr, what effect catnip has on them, how cats find their way home, etc.Desmond Morris is a zoologist and he has a deep knowledge of many subject areas.  This is a simple read, but it is quite interesting and a nice gift book for cat owners.
