I'm also a tourist, as I love the City, and I travel there too, although I don't have go to very far :). This book is small, so you can put it in your pocket or purse and have it with you anytime you might need it. It covers all of the main features a resident might need. Getting around. Local blow up inset maps of each neighborhood. Lots of information about attractions (like Golden Gate Park or the Presedio) that is as or almost as detailed as most guidebooks. The print is small, so on the one hand, you will be amazed at how much information is in this book. But the print is small, so if you need glasses, either wear them or don't get this book. Or bring a magnifier with you :(. When I was first learning the city, this and a Streetwise San Francisco map is all I carried with me, and they were all I needed. Now, I don't need anything most of the time, so I don't carry this any longer except on occasion. I have many other guidebooks on San Francisco, but most of them didn't add much of value to the basic information contained in the NFT guide. If you want chatty discourse, you will not get it here. If you want raw and clear information, you will get it here. The book implies tourists shouldn't apply by the title, but that is marketing. It's as useful for a tourist as any guidebook, if you are a tourist that wants to get off the beaten path of the few main tourist attractions and actually explore the City. It doesn't focus on tourist attractions, but it does list them. So if you want a book that has 50 pages on Fisherman's Wharf, this won't be it. If you want everything to get equal treatment, this can work. And you'll find information about places you won't find in the guidebooks, which makes the City that much more interesting. One thing this book won't do is weigh you down. And, it's well constructed, and made to hold up to a lot of abuse. The paper is strong, and the cover is flexible but also very strong. Far better than the simple paperback format of most guidebooks. In short, this was a great purchase, and I would recommend it as one of your resources if you are living in or visiting in San Francisco.
