Jim Gaines has got a lot more going for himself than a bunch of Grammy's for his engineering and production. He even has a lot more going on than a career spent shaping the sound of legends like Stevie Ray Vaughn, Buddy Guy, Santana, George Throughgood, Herbie Hancock, The Blues Travelers and Huey Lewis.Maybe his biggest accomplishment was landing Sandy Carroll for a wife. And proving you can mix (pun intended) business with pleasure he produced this fine album of contemporary blues, mostly penned by his wife, and featuring her deep soulful southern kissed voice along with a virtual who's-who of first call  musicians.By the way, if the title of the album, Just As I Am sounds vaguely familiar, it's because the tune was made popular by the late, great Luther Allison and written by Carroll, Luther Allison and James Solberg. Carroll had a long professional relationship with Allison (and many more huge blues stars such as Albert King and Reba Russell) during her time as a preeminent contemporary blues song writer. The tune closes out the album and is a touching, tender blues ballad given here a pinch of Louisiana country flavor.This album has it all, from contemporary blues to Tex-mex tinged retro rockers, and country/cajun blues and a kiss of zydeco. The guitar work is grand, the backing vocals perfect, Carroll's piano work is nice, and there is even some nice, blues organ. All in all, a fun disc showcasing Sandy Carroll's song writing, bluesy pipes and touch on the piano. throw this in the middle of your mix and have a little fun.
