This is a good book for couples to read and discuss: you may not agree with it, but it is a good discussion starter.The marriage counsellor author claims to have found 10 basic needs people have and has sorted them into the top 5 for men and top 5 for women.My wife and I are certainly not your average couple, if his list is really reliable.His list of the top emotional needs is:1. Affection2. Sexual Fulfilment3. Conversation4. Recreational Companionship5. Honesty and Openness6. An Attractive Spouse7. Financial Support8. Domestic Support [= help with household duties]9. Family Commitment [= help with child-rearing]10. AdmirationHe points out that a man's top need might be his wife's eighth need. It is important to her, but not nearly as important as it is to him. And vice versa, of course.Reading the book has made me reflect on how well I meet my wife's needs. This can only be a good thing.I knocked off a star, because the book is marketed in Christian bookstores, but is hardly a Christian book. But I highly recommend reading and reflecting on what he has to say.
