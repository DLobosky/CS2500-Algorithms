I purchased this phone from Amazon and have been using since 2 monthsCons:- Can not conference 2 outgoing calls. But you can conference up to two system handsets together with one outside call.- Can save only 50 numbers in the phone book.- Speaker phone exists only in the handset not in the base. I think this is same for most of the phones in the market.Pros:- Great call quality (both using handset and speaker phone)- Excellent range, I am able to use this phone from my neighbors house. Its amazing.- Longer talk time and greater battery life. After the full battery charge, I used this phone continuously for 2 hours in a conference call and I still see 3 bars out of 3 in the battery indicator. Panasonic claims the talk time is 17 hours for this phone but i have not tested. I noticed that the standby time is more than 5 days.- Alarm works perfectly in the handset- Light weight handset. The handset uses rechargeable AAA batteries which is easy to get.- Large buttons in the number pad.- The screen is clear and you can see the caller ids clearly. The screen is auto shutoff after few seconds to save battery.- I am using one handset but this system can be Expandable up to 6 handsets
