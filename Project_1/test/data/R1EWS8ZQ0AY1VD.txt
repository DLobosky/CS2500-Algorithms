This whole cat and mouse film wraps up to an astonishing conclusion, when Darth Vader reveals  &quot;what really happened to Lukes father&quot; We all know the drill, but  thats to bad, since thats one of the coolest surprise endings i've seen.  When they used in in the third film, it just seemed gratitious, to tie up  loose ends. Oh well. Excellent, more action and emotion oriented sci fi.
