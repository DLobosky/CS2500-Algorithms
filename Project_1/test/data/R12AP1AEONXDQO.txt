This series takes the conspiracy and monster-of-the-week formula of The X-Files and lets it run. This series is about serial killers and mass murderers. They are the monsters-of-the-week. There's no aliens or mutants, just normal looking individuals who have a few things missing in the head.It stars Lance Henriksen as a burnt-out former FBI profiler (agents who delve into the minds of serial killers to figure out how they tick in order to catch future killers) named Frank Black who has resettled in a quaint and quiet neighborhood of Seattle, WA. But whatever caused him to retire from the FBI hasn't stopped him from helping police agencies on the behest of a private law-enforcement group called The Millennium Group.Each week, Frank is called in to help in a murder investigation that has the look of a ritualistic killing. This series really pushes the boundaries of whats allowed on TV with some of the very disturbing images they show on each episode. The images are not gratuitous since it helps the viewer see what Frank sees. It also helps explains how such images and thoughts can numb a person to the degradation and evil all around them. I would be burnt-out just like Frank is I had to see those things in my head all the time. But with the help of his co-workers within the The Group, he prevails and stays out of the abyss for one more day.Lance Henriksen's Frank Black is the series. Lance seems perfect in the role of Frank Black. The weathered, lined face that seem to have seen more than it should have and his low, gravelly voice makes Frank Black his. I cannot see the Frank character being played by anyone else.Millennium is a series that takes abit of daring to watch and sit through. A series about looking into the minds of serial killers is not for everyone, but should at least be tried. The acting and writing is top-notch. The perpetual doom of the night scenes and the sunny dispositions of the day scenes at Frank's yellow-painted home makes Millennium one of the better-looking series to date. Chris Carter took a daring chance with this series and I think he succeeded. I recommend this series for fans of The X-Files. It is a much superior series to the other serial killer drama, The Profiler.
