Ms. Manguso has written a medically graphic but affecting account of her battle with an auto-immune disease. Written in brief paragraphs with short chapters, the author is clealy recalling a bad dream that she rather not recall. A poet, her writing is lyrical and conversational.  Once the reader starts her story, you will not put it down and it is easily read in one sitting. But it is a book that you will come back to.
