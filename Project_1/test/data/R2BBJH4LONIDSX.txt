He's a complete master of the fretboard and whammy bar whose guitar can sound angelic and then suddenly thunderous. Many of his most riveting and agressive songs were played including "Becks Bolero," "Big Block," Brush With The Blues" and the intense "Scatterbrain." His eastern influences also resonated on wonderful songs such as "Nadia" and the psychedelic "Blast From The East." Jeff Beck's most tender and complex songs really impressed the audience and UK music critics. Examples are "Angel (Footsteps,)" Cause We've Ended As Lovers" and the inimitable "Were Were You." Beck's majestic rendition of the Beatles' " A Day In The Life" is utterly captivating and it has rightfully won a 2010 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. "Led Boats", "Behind The Veil" and "Stratus" are also spellbinding highlights on this flawless all instrumental CD. Jeff Beck can literally coax, caress and strangle a universe of sounds from his guitar without using hardly any effects. Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Brian May and Tom Scholz have all declared that Jeff Beck is the greatest solo guitarist. This CD verifies their erudite assertions.
