The fantasy sequences here are truly astonishing at times, and are so colorful and imaginative that they're a treat to watch. Alas, if only the story and acting had done as much for me. I found it pretty slow going, all told, but am duly impressed with the vision presented herein.Allegorical, weird, wild, and yet also somehow a little too ambitious, Mirrormask is certainly worth checking out if you like Henson's firm's imagination enough to put aside story concerns for a couple of hours. Phantasmagorical, plus and minus.
