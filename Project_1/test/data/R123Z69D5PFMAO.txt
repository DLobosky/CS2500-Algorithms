She will go for months without wrecking one of her toys, then, suddenly- she will shred a chosen toy. I have tried every brand of toy, but none have ever stood-up to her for any amount of time. These Coleman toys are incredibly tough,the eyes and other features are stitching so that there is nothing for the dog to chew off of the toy. The fabric is very strong and not easily punctured by sharp dog teeth. My dogs have always tried to destroy the squeakers as soon as I have given then the toys. The Coleman toys have more than one squeaker and they are durable. Since the fabric is so tough, the 6 dogs have been unable to chew through the cloth and remove the squeaker. I will buy more of these toys to replace the other non-Coleman toys that my 6 dogs destroy. I recommend these toys.
