And the (included) bushing (that keeps pellets from falling into the receiver) is an important touch.BUT --- there was no provision for a lanyard attachment, or a grip knob. When you drop one of these trays in the grass somewhere, you'll see what I mean. I tapped mine and added a small loop on the right side. That way, I can "tray-in" a pellet (say, a Predator --- which is too long to rotate in the magazines), then yank the tray and pop the magazine in --- without juggling.BETTER YET: I honestly do not know why I hadn't tried this before. This seems to be the best place to put this comment, so far. The Predators are (in my experience) pretty "emphatic" in their performance. But they're too long to rotate in the Benjamin magazine.THERE IS A SOLUTION: Load the magazine completely. Then, push a Predator in the exposed (first-shot) hole, pushing the pellet that had been there out. Make sure the tip of the Predator isn't hanging out front.This will give you a full 10-shot magazine, with a "first-strike" Predator capability --- and 9 of your choice (mine's Crosman Pointed) behind it. If you've used the Predators, you might've noticed that follow-ups are generally superfluous. But with a little care, this really does work.
