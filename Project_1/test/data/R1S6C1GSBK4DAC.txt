Tierney is quite the scholar. I have to say, however, that the reviewer who sees a few flaws in the book is correct, although I wouldn't say that the thesis is totally undermined at all.For those of us who are seeking to overcome the east-west division in Christianity (note that I did not say "Church") and who find the role of the papacy as a crucial element to that union, I recommend: Brian Tierney's "Origins of Papal Infallibility" and "Foundations of the Conciliar Theory"; Heft's "John xxii and Papal Teaching Authority"; "THeir Lord and OUrs" ed by Santer; "The Unity of the Churches of God" ed by Sherwood; "Byzantium and the Roman Primacy" by Francis Dvornik; "WHat Will Doctor Newman Do?" by John Page; "Towards Christian REunion" by Bermejo; "Ecumenism" ed by Cunningham; "Catholicity and the Church" by John Meyendorff (everything he writes is insightful and scholarly); COngar's "Diversity and Communion" (read everything he writes!); "Peter and Paul in teh CHurch of Rome" by Farmer and Kereszty; and "Rome and the Eastern Churches" by that great scholar Aidan Nichols. There are, of course, so many others, so if you know of any that I need to read, email me via the "about me" page! Thanks!
