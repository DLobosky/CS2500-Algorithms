Marie Osmond has a beautiful voice, and this album is pleasing.  Steppin' Stone was released in 1989.  All ten of the songs are likeable.  Also, the album sports a laid-back quality to it.  My favorite songs are "What's a Little Love Between Friends," "A Too Blue Moon," and "Let Me Be the First."  "What's a Little Love Between Friends" is a pretty one, while "A Too Blue Moon" has a nice refrain, and "Let Me Be the First" features smooth harmony vocals during the chorus.  The CD is almost 35 minutes.  The song lyrics are not included in the CD insert.  Steppin' Stone is a recommendable piece of work.
