Roz is fiesty and independent and not interested in marriage at all but wants to be a journalist.  Her father is trying to marry her off and in frustration she takes off on her horse to go and think.  She is hiding near a bridge when she hears voices then 3 shots, then sees two bodies fall in the river who look like the wanted man that killed her friend's father.  One is floating down the river and one made it to shore.  Believing the man on shore to be dead she goes for a closer look.  All of a sudden (Eli) reaches out and grabs her and puts a hand over her mouth.  She goes with him out of fear and believes him to be a wanted murder.  As they travel together and she cares for his wounds (he was shot in the leg and a graze on the head) and they talk... she begins to doubt the validity of her thoughts that he is a cold blooded killer.  He thinks she is sassy and independent but he respects her because of it.  She begins to really feel drawn to him because of his inner strength and the fact that he likes her for who she is not because she has money or society connections.  She nurses him back to health and lays out a plan to clear his name.  It is this whole plan in which many mysteries come to light.  Although they are each feeling drawn to each other he really feels that once his name is cleared he must leave her.  He thinks that because he is a half-breed and not from society that she will be subject to gossip which he doesn't want to do to her.  What will he decide???????If you like action, humor, mystery and a happy ending then you will love this book.  I thought it was a great read.  I recommend it.
