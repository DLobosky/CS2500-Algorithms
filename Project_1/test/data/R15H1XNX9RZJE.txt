I bought this book after reading The Best American Spiritual Writing 2010 and 2007. While all the pieces in these collections are well written and interesting, there weren't any in this edition that left a strong impression on me. I also felt that much of the writing in this collection was on topics that were religious rather than spiritual. If you only have time for one collection, I'd recommend the 2007.
