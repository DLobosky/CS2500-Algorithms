For long-time fans, this is a treat (although the selection of songs on the recording could have been a bit better).  For newbies, it's easy to get a taste of some shredders you may otherwise not be aware of -- some of the best are here.  It is hard to pick a favorite song, but I guess I would choose "Over the Edge," by Stephen Ross.One note on the downside, the remastering of the Vol. 1 songs is unfortunately a bit dull, especially when compared to Vol. 2 which is remastered by a different person and sounds much cleaner, brighter, and richer.If you like this collection, I suggest you checkout This Is Shredding, Vol. 2 which I believe is actually a bit better than the Vol. 1 collection (the remastering is better and the songs are more melodic overall).
