I bought this ring along with another smoky quartz ring from the same vendor. This ring fit nicely, but the large stone was chipped, scratched and had numerous bubbles in it. The silver is 'heavy' looking, not delicate. The other ring had to go back because it was simply HUGE, and I didn't want something that big, but it was in excellent condition. It sat a good half an inch above the top of my finger and the stone was as wide. This ring was also big, but not overly so. Neither appeared like good quality rings but then for these prices, you can't really expect top quality.
