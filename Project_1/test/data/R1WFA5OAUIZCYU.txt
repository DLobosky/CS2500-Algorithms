It allowed a much deeper and multi-faceted relationship to develop between them.  And it also helped Anna get to know 2 of his brothers very well - which gave readers a chance to get to know them as well.  I loved the relationship among the 3 brothers as well as meeting their father - the Duke - his wife, getting a glimpse at their relationship, other members of the family and its history, etc.I adored Anna's relationship with Morgan, and how that character developed.The troubles facing Anna even had promise.But some elements of the book that would have been fine became incredibly frustrating because the book simply dragged on for too long.  Honestly, I think a good 100 pages could have been cut and it would have tightened up the plot, made the danger seem more real and pressing - and not led me to roll my eyes at some of the impressions held by, and misunderstandings between, our hero and heroine.  **spoilerish** Because of the drawn out story/book, Anna spent far too much time not trusting an obviously trustworthy Westhaven.  And she began to look at minimum foolish if not truly stupid to not see how his (and his father's) power could have greatly diminished if not entirely removed the threat.  For his part, Westhaven made every argument for marriage under the sun, save the one that would actually have mattered - that he loved her!  Since she'd admitted her feelings for him, how could he not have realized that the fact he returned those feelings might have gotten him the positive response he so desired.  While this gave his family members some funny moments when they essentially rolled their own eyes at how he was bungling things - a little of that would have been great but there was far too much opportunity since in my opinion this story was artificially stretched.  And I really can't see to what end.At the same time, rather than take advantage of the length to provide new info/back-story as opposed to repeating the same things, we were left with huge missing pieces of the family history and dynamics, especially regarding Westhaven's 2 deceased brothers, how one of them may have been involved with a woman who was briefly/previously Westhaven's betrothed, etc.  This is the first book in the series, yet parts of it felt like I was reading a 2nd or 3rd book.  I will very likely read the next book in the series because I did get to know and love Dev.  I am glad I read this - but even more so that I only spent 89 cents vs. paying full purchase price.  Significant editing/chopping length could have transformed this book - at least for me - into a 4 or even 5 star read.  The pieces were all there, but too much adrift in a sea of excess (and therefore repetitive) verbiage.
