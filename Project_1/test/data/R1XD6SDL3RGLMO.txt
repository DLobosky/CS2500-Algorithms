&quot;Life Strategies&quot; is one of those rare finds, a self-help book that does not wallow in big words or esoteric concepts.  Mr. McGraw outlines his steps for success in life in simple, direct, yet engagingly  written chapters.  The organization of the book is excellent throughout and  reflects an author who has had extensive experience in dealing with people  from all walks of life.  He deals with concepts such as self-reliance,  individual responsibility and similar notions often downplayed (or ignored  outright) by other authors seeking to play into the culture of  victimization. You will find none of that in Mr. McGraw's book; his main  theme is that we are responsible for our own lives.Once you pick up the  book, it is difficult to put down; you will find yourself nodding your head  at what you have always known in your heart, but do not always acknowledge  in your daily life.
