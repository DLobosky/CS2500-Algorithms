On the plus side, so far Claire and her friends have managed to survive getting on the wrong side of some Morganville VIPs...Vampire Important Persons. But their temporary peace is in danger of collapsing, thanks to the arrival of her new boyfriend's scary father and his vampire-fighting supporters.Review:While I really liked Glass Houses (book one) I loved The Dead Girls' Dance. Being the second book in the series, the groundwork has all been laid out in book one, and so the world building gets a bit more detail and the characters have a chance to build on their relationships.The tension in this book is so much stronger than the first. Shane's father is a fanatical nutcase and his bikers are so scary, the sense of danger they convey is so strong. Again it ends on a big cliffhanger (but with book three to hand I was fine with that). I loved how the four friends have to try to maintain a balance within their own group but also with the vampires and humans in Morganville, it sets up so much conflict which is really interesting to read about. And just when you think it can't get any more complicated, Rachel Caine throws one psycho stalksy brother into the mix. I can't wait to read more about him in the next book. I love a good psycho.I'm really enjoying the way the romances are unfolding too. They are a bit more complicated than the usual romance, but aren't full of people making stupid decisions so they are interesting and not annoying. Much appreciated, as the cliche romance grates a bit.SPOILER ALERT I had one concern with the story which was the manner in which Claire's drugging and attempted rape was handled. I didn't like that the boys got told off by a big scary vampire and that was it. And that then Claire kind of relates to them due to their fear, and later considers how they're probably nice people most of the time. And then later finds out that Monica set it up and nothing happens to her. This bothered me as I worry that young girls would read this and think that letting something as heinous as this 'go' is the normal way to handle it. I understand that in Morganville things like this are not dealt with in the same way as in the 'real' world, but this really stood out for me as the WRONG way to handle this. SPOILER OVER.I'm realising that rather than a typical trilogy or four part series, this is more like the Sookie Stackhouse series in that there is endless potential for the story and the characters and there's likely to be many more stories to come. Hooray!
