So, it all came down to price for me, which, as of this writing was found cheapest on Amazon. It comes wrapped in plastic wrapping and each one was received without scratches (good luck finding that at an office supply store). Here comes my favorite part though: No label stuck to the thing!  So, you get to spend the extra 5 minutes watching hamsters do stuff on youtube. Highly recommended.
