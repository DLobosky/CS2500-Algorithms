This is a sweet, easy to read book on 50 things that can help improve the happiness of your life.  I found most of them things I could do better and some I could start doing.  A few I was on the fence about and may or may not try them in my life.It was a hard book to put down since all the chapters were short and each led into the next.  I think reading one a day would be a great way to really use this book to its fullest.  That way you could bring that secret into your life during the day you read about it.Being happy is a choice and I think that Luci makes that clear in the idea that you can improve your own happiness with a few simple steps and ideas.  Make the choice to be happy, or make the choice to be miserable it really is up to each of us to decide how we will face each new day.  I love the saying, "If Mama ain't happy, ain't no one happy."  So true in my life, I set the tone for my family each and every day.  I would much rather set a happy tone for all seven of us to follow then an unhappy one.Do you want to be happier?  Who doesn't?  Give this book a try and I think that anyone can find something that they can use between its pages.  Change is sometimes a good thing ;)
