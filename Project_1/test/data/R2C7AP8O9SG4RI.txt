No matter how fantastic or commonplace the setting, her characters draw us in, make us feel welcome, and gently encourage us to enjoy ourselves. The settings and storylines of Future Histories are definitely among the most fantastic Giselle has written, and the exploration of gender and sexuality is both deeper and broader than ever before. Once again, it's the characters who encourage us to embrace the new and the unusual, as opposed to being distanced or alienated by it.Overall, the themes here are of fluidity and choice. Gender and sexuality are neither solely attributes of birth, nor the product of societal conditioning. Instead, they are deeply personal aspects of individual identity, as wondrous and as diverse as the people expressing them. These are stories that entertain and arouse, but they are also stories that make you think. I loved each and every one of them, and sincerely hope you'll take a chance on sharing that joy.
