My 5 year old loves Moxie Girlz.  I like the fact that they are a step down from "Bratz" dolls which I thought were too made up and teenager-looking.  She loves their "fashion" clothes!The only strange thing is that they don't have feet.  When the shoes come off, there is just a leg with a ball on the bottom (that plugs into the shoe).  So if your child looses the shoes....well you just don't want that to happen.  I told my daughter to keep their shoes on at all times.  I don't think she has two barbie shoes that match anyway, so while this seems weird, it's not a big deal.No complaints here, though I notice that the price has gone up. (This review is based on an approximate $12 cost) I would not pay $29 for it as it is currently priced. YIKES!!We have not tried the snow due to some of the reviews I read and, well, we live in the Northeast and have our own snow this time of year.
