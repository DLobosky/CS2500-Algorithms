I haven't had any good results with refilled cartridges, so I only buy new. That way, the quality is a known factor. I print both documents and photographs from my old HP 3620 printer, and this HP27 lasts a good long time; even after the ink level indicator says it's nearly empty, I can get ten good documents printed out before the output fades!
