The story took place in the 1960's telling about Philip Chabot's life as a youth, how and where he grew up, his schooling, his friends, and his home life.  I found this part of the book very interesting as it leads to the beginnings of a power he discovered, his Psychic powers and how he learned in many odd ways to control those powers.  Very few of the few friends he had believed he had any special powers but they knew he was "different."  Philip had recurring thoughts of China made more interesting when he met a male friend of Chinese descent who roomed with him for a while.  Through Philip's mind he wanted to talk to China.  The friend told Philip that he was engaged to marry the granddaughter of Chairman Mao but he could arrange for Philip to become the person to marry Mao's granddaughter if he wished.  After some thinking Philip came to the conclusion that perhaps this would be a way for him to "talk" to China and he agreed to become her fianc&eacute; even though he never had talked to her or anyone in China connected to her/  Philip had worked for his father but he wanted to get into the photography field on his own, not just in the old-fashioned layout work he was performing for his father.  All the equipment was outdated in his fathers business so one can see why a more upbeat job would advance his life.  Philip did go to college but had a hard time studying his courses.  His mind wandered too much to concentrate on school.  Eventually he took off, leaving his home without telling his family and with little money besides his savings for his future.As Philip drove he saw things again only more than previously.  Philip was finally put in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital.  He found out he could leave if he wished but he felt he needed this place for his good and his future.  Philip made many connections while in the hospital and he did not try to leave, in fact, he was helping other patients as much as he was being helped and he seemed to like it, all except the drugs. In time he was released and went home with the condition that he see a doctor for further treatments, which he did.  He started doing free work for the local newspaper in hopes a salaried job might be available if he showed them his great ability in photography.  He was eventually given a paid position but soon the newspaper had to cut staff and he was gone.Philip returned home to once again help with his fathers antiquated catalog business.  Eventually he took off again and his real adventures started using his physic ability.  While reading this book I had a hard time believing that anyone had such powers but the proof is there with the many contacts Philip Chabot had, the many people he met and told fantastic things about them past, present, and future.  His life in the 60's is very interesting.  Meeting foreign people psychically, mostly in England, Russia, and eventually China, followed by conferences with the FBI and the CIA.  He could carry on conversations without the use of phones to others that had the same gift.When I finished the book it left me wondering if Philip still has these psychic abilities or if that ability has disappeared.  Philip, you had quite a life, one that I wonder if it was enjoyed or led out of fear at times.  These abilities would make any one of us start to wonder if we were normal or if we truly had that extra ability that Philip had.
