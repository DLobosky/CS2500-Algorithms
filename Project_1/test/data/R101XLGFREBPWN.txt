Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz by L. Frank Baum is the fourth book in the oz series and deals with the adventures of dorothy, her relative zeb, the talking horse Jim and the the very strange kitten Heureka. In this story we get to meet the vegetable people, the return of the wizard of oz and princess ozma, the cowardly lion and many other beloved charachters from the former books. The illustrations are splendid and the adventures are filled with exciting encounters and astounding discriptions. This series just gets better and better and I can not wait to read the next book in this splendid series.
