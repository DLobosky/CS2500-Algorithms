First of all, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it RIGHT NOW!  The action sequences are excellent, not to mention the plot and music score.That said, I had high hopes for the DVD release, as it promised  extended sequences, 5.1 audio, and better image quality.  As for the first  two, I was not dissapointed.  The extra scenes contributed to the plot and  enhanced the action.  Also, the music is excellent.  The image quality,  however, leaves something to be desired, which is why I only gave it 3  stars.  The MPEG translation (the process of converting 35 mm film into DVD  format) was horrible with dark scenes and motion (the waterfall scene was  especially bad) resulting in a blurred and/or pixelated image.  All I can  say is that I hope they release another version.Oh, and if you don't yet  have it, grab the soundtrack.  It's kind of in the theme of The Rock or  Crimson Tide, by which I mean that it is really, really good.
