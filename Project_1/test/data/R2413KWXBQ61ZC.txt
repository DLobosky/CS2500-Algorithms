The bad new: it's a dark version of the Goonies without most of the fun. The good news: my cousin got it from OnDemand. I didn't spend a dime on this movie, yay!Super 8 borrows from Aliens, the Goonies, ET, the directing style of Jaws or most older Spielberg movies, and the Blob.It's not the worst movie but definitely not worth any of the hype and the preview was much better than most of the movie.I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an "Extended", "Super", "Ultimate", "Collectors" version of whatever movie at some point.I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your "Ultimate", "Platinum", "Gold", "Silver", "Special Anniversary" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even them I will buy one version of your movie and no more.Oh, and flixster.com sucks! If you give me a digital version of a movie, don't make visit a new site or make me register for a new service. I already have one and don't care about all of the other services.
