This DVD is worth the price just for the opening chapter filmed in what appears to be Wudang Mountain.This Tai Yi Daoist Form is a series of sword work which includes incredibly fast strikes, swift turns and footwork, very low lunges, dragon turns, right and left and they are all performed with the outward appearance of an unworldly spirit. No fight in his face, only focused intention. Master Zhou is strong, balanced, light, swift and soft, all in the same breath. Poetry in motion.This DVD is rated at skill level one. That's a bit of a stretch if you have no experience at all with sword. If you know any sword forms and warm up or sparring drills, then level one it is.The instruction on the film is in English and Chinese, you can choose when you begin the play. No subtitles to distract. I find the narrators voice very easy to follow.He begins by giving a history of Sword play as weapon and a means to better health. There are some wonderful photos/paintings of the old masters. The shots of Master Zhou practicing in front of the temples in the mountains are stunning. Made me want to buy a ticket to China!There are short pieces about Sword etiquette, care of the sword and safety. A few warm up exercises are shown. I would have like to see more of them as well as warm up partner drills with the wooden practice swords. I think that would have been appropriate for a level one beginner disc.The Tai Yi Daoist Form is shown in slow motion and at real speed. Master Zhou also breaks down the movements, names them and uses them in application with a student.I do practice one short Yang style sword form that I learned about 10 years ago. My teacher at the time taught one move every two weeks, (four, one hour classes in each week). He would watch us do the move and then add the next one into the form. A slow way to learn, but very effective. Personally, I find it hard to stop the disc, practice a move, restart, again and again. I would like more repetition of the form, in sequence on a beginner dvd. Everyone learns at different rates. One thing for sure, the DVD gives a clear overview ofboth forms and applications. I especially like the list of movement names included in the packaging. I find it easier to remember forms if I know the name of the movement.This is a welcome addition to any Martial Arts library. Pure Power and Poetry.
