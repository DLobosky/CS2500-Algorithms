These audio books were written by Anne Emerick, translated from English into Spanish, and put together on CD with both versions being read by bilingual actors.  Each chapter is first read sentence by sentence.  First, a sentence is read in English; then it is read in Spanish.  When the entire chapter has been read sentence by sentence, it is then read all the way through in Spanish.Designed to help people learn Spanish without the `work' of a traditional language program, No Work Spanish takes a very different approach to language education.  This approach is very modern, and incredibly inductive.  I don't feel that this approach is all one would need to become fluent in a language, or even to learn to read the language, but I do feel that these audio books have their place.In order to become fluent every student needs to have a good input of audio from the target language.  In order to really understand the cadences and syntax of a language, one needs to hear it spoken, and No Work Spanish does a great job of this.  Still, I feel it is better suited as a supplement.  Adults who have had former instruction in Spanish will be able to pick up a great deal of their vocabulary again as they brush off those rusty Spanish skills.  However, children will learn much faster with a more traditional, direct-input approach.  I believe it would take quite a while to build a workable vocabulary from such an inductive approach.  I recommend trying out No Work Spanish as an adjunct to such a program, not as a replacement.In that supplementary role, I think No Work Spanish is great!  It is really a unique product, and my daughter (who hasn't had any formal Spanish at this point) told me that she could pick out similarities between Spanish and English words just from overhearing me listening to the audio CDs.  I think that is pretty neat!  These are great to listen to when your hands are busy with some other work - when you are driving, washing dishes, cleaning house etc.Yaks March on Washington is told from the perspective of a ranch dog, it follows the true story of an Idaho rancher who travels across the US with six yaks on his way to a Tibetan festival.  This is a fun, short story, read by a male voice actor.  The pronunciation of both English and Spanish is clear and authentic (to my ears at least), and the story is told on one CD.  This practical, engaging, and outdoorsy story will be very appealing to male students.
