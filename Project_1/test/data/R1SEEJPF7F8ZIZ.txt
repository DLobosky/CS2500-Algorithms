I disagree, I knew all along I was watching Star Trek, and not just because of the characters, but the shipshots/space shots, it very much felt like Star Trek, in my opinion, they went out with a big BANG!Bottom line, if you are a fan of Star Trek, you MUST get this set, the video and audio are excellent quality, and you get a nice load of extras, and the bonus 'Evolutions' disc, once again I never saw these movies before, and I will be watching these again soon, now I need to get 'The Original Series' movie set, I've seen all those, but I still need it on DVD, buy this with confidence!Trek-on.
