It's always gratifying when a piece of hardware just works, and this is just such a piece of hardware. I plugged in the transmitter, put the included AA battery in the mouse, and Windows XP did the rest. Seamless. No drivers to install, no problems whatsoever. I was mousing in 10 seconds. As for the people who complained about its limited range, that strikes me as unreasonable. It works from five feet away, and I can't imagine why you'd need that much.
