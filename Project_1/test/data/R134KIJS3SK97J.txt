And, because the stickers are *not* removable, you effectively wind up with a single-use book. This should have been an inexpensive paperback or even a disposable sticker book, especially considering the limited seasonal appeal.The color scheme is, unsurprisingly, pastel, however some combinations are hard to read (e.g., pink on blue). The bunny on the front cover is covered with glitter which is not a personal preference.
