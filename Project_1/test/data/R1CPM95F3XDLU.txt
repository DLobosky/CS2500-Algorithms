I've seen plenty of the CC episodes too, mind you, so I'm aquainted with every phase of the show, I just see a lot of fans poo poo the SciFi years, and I'll tell you right now some of my very favorite episodes are from those last few seasons.Anyway, here's a breakdown of Vol 4, which feature 4 episodes from the SciFi era of the show, all episodes that I was familiar with, but until I bought this box set, I hadn't seen in at least 5 or 6 years:GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS:  A 60's drama that chronicles the rise of Michelle, an aspiring Go Go dancer and her eventual entanglement in the world of drug dealing that everyone in these rise to fame movies falls into.  I remember this being an "okay" episode previously, but now having watched it a few times again its become one of my top 10 favorite episodes.  I think this is actually a really great "first episode" to show to people who haven't seen the show before.  The movie has some really wacky characters, the plot is cliched but moves quickly enough, and everything they do to accomplish those set plot points they do in just the stupidest way possible (the idiotic dancing, pouring beer on a motorcycle seat, robbing a jail by having ONE trustee exit, then having TWO come back in while being completely unnoticed by the sheriff they JUST WALKED PAST), making all the riffing just as easy as can be.  Really a great episode, even the host segments are funny (Mike "Taliban" Nelson).  One of the best on the set, and like I said, one of my top 10 favorites.HAMLET:  This one gets trashed by a ton of MSTies but I don't really understand why.  True, its not the greatest episode, but its far from deserving the "worst episode ever" tag that gets repeatedly thrown at it (I'd watch this over SWAMP DIAMONDS any day of the week).  Basically, its Hamlet, but a terribly boring, sparsely set, Made-for-German-TV version that Mike and the Bots have to sit through.  Its about the dullest production of Hamlet I've seen, but I still thought they did an admirable job, and I found myself laughing out loud quite a bit at several very funny riffs (see my review title for one such example).  I think it gets a bad rap mainly due to fans not really being familiar with Shakespeare, and therefore are somewhat intolerant of the film itself.  Whatever the reason is for all the haters though, i still think its a fine episode, not the best by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable to me.OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK:  A movie made for PBS starring Raul Julia.  Its just a terrible Sci Fi movie that makes very little sense at all.  I remember liking this episode a lot back in the day, but upon watching it again found it to be a bit on the boring side.  The riffs weren't that fast and furious, and the movie itself is just a chore.  Its still worth watching, and I did get a chuckle or two, but I remembered it being much funnier.  Still a fan favorite, so your milage may vary, but its not a favorite of this fan.SPACE MUTINY:  A classic.  Basically the 80's Sci Fi equivalent of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" in that it gets everything so very wrong that it ends up being a completely hilarious movie, though not at all on purpose.  Mike and the Bots have a field day with this one and the great riffs combined with the complete insanity of the actual film itself make it an easy favorite of mine.  How can you not love the car chase through the ships basement on two dinky electric go carts("Toro! Toro!... These things are made by Toro!")?  Just so much to love about this episode, its a must own.All in all, a good set of episodes.  Two are amazing, two are okay, but all are worth seeing at least once.
