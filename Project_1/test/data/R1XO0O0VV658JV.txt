Since there were limited reviews on refill inks and particular printers I decided on this printer. The experiment cost me about $115 total. And I do have to say it does work, this particular combination this printer with the continuous feed (piano) system.  My current cost for ink I estimated to be less than a cent a page, this includes color pages also. Since the price was so low I did not bother to do the final estimates.  For once, I can print b/w and color pages as much as I want (no photos) and not have to worry about replacement cartridges.  My previous cost was $30 for 800 pages on my HP and about $40 for 2500 pages on my brother laser printer, I have to catch the toner on sale.  Technically if you used the original brother ink with this printer it would be more expensive than the HP printer.  The reason refill inks probably works with this printer is I imagine because, the ink cartridges are less high tech, but does work well. I have been using the combination for over a month now and have gone through 6 reams of paper, about 3000 pages. Whereas I used to printout emails and web pages using b/w on my HP because of the cost now I print out in color (fast normal quality) instead.  The only problem I had was initially after the first 2 reams of paper the print quality began to drop, this means that the test page showed missing dots. I could'nt figure out what to do, I emailed the guys who sold me the continuous feed system, they were very helpful and responded immediately but they kept thinking I got the feed system coiled up or something. Anyway I found a video on youtube that taught how to clean the print heads with water, I did it and then had to auto clean it about 10 times and viola, never a problem since. I do try and do a auto clean after heavy usage or at least once a week now.  Apparently, auto cleans wastes ink but who cares my ink is now too cheap.In summary this combination of this printer with piano style continuous feed ink works, you will save a bundle and never have to worry about ink prices again.  Like I said there are not much reviews out there. I took the risk and it worked. HP printer + refill ink might be big risk my HP Photo premium did not work (see my other review).  The only limitation I have now is since I bought the low end printer I do not have auto feed and duplex, features I will add next time I buy a brother printer which will be soon because I put this baby through lots of prints.   I had to get this review out to folks because it has saved me a lot of $$$$, since I work from home and have 3 kids, I do a lot of home printing.
