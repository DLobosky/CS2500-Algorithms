There is a direct correlation between the audacity of Poirot's mustache and the quality of Suchet's performances in this series.  In this movie, it is a sad, tired looking thing, and that perfectly describes his performance here.  In fact, several of his later works lack the intensity and flamboyance present in his early work that made his character so popular. Over time, you can see how drab his mustache has grown as well.The whole cast seems to follow Suchet's lead, delivering lifeless performances in a stale atmosphere.  It's as if the ending was a foregone conclusion. There is no tension over the murder, no background buzz about the gaiety and thrill of the adventure from riding the fabulously exotic, luxurious and perhaps slightly decadent Orient Express. The location is completely wasted. They might as well have filmed this on a public transit bus.Trivia:Did you know Suchet played a role in a Poirot movie starring Peter Ustinov?  He played Inspector Japp in the movie Thirteen for Dinner.
