First, let me say I haven't seen the movie. But based on the promos for it I was so turned off by the INaccuracy, I refused to see it.In the promos, there's a woman hanging up her wash on an outdoor clothes line. With the Japanese buzzing past her, presumably on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.The facts are the Japanese attacked at 6:00am.Now, you may say that it's possible for a woman to be doing laundry at 6am on a Sunday.But in the same promo, there's also a little boy playing baseball by himself on a little league field. Also with the Japanese buzzing by.Complete and utter HOGWASH. And an insult to my intelligence.Admittedly, since I haven't actually seen the movie, I could be taking these scenes out of context. But if the Japanese planes had been sighted by civilians(not to mention the Military) at a time previous to the invasion, wouldn't that put a damper on a surprise attack?
