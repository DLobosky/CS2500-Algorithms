I have tried many different lubes and this is the only one I have ever found somewhat satisfying (other than Elbow Grease for extreme anal penetration)and able to use for an extended period of time during sex. I am not claiming that one application keeps going because I find this lube does loose it's lubrication effect in an average amount of time. I don't find that this gets sticky or have excess build up. Out of all lubes that I have personally tried it is the only one that doesn't feel nasty within just a couple of minutes. I am usually so disgusted with the lubrication if using a different product that it ruins the sex. I have not used this with any male masturbation devices like the flesh light, etc... so I can not comment on the interactions between this lube and those practices. I have used it for many sexual experiences and lots of anal play including toys made out of various materials, including various sizes (as large as a fist) and have never had any problems. Finally I personally have not had any problem with stains, smells, or other adverse reactions.
