After my first pair of JBuds fizzled and died on me after about six months of daily use (I'm a DC Metro rider), JBuds did the right thing and sent me these J2's for free. Right on cue, this pair has now also died. Can't say I didn't get my money's worth, but I feel obligated to report that durability is a serious issue with this product. Just know what you're getting into here.
