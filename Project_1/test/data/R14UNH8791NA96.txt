The flimsy plastic fork-shaped connectors between the ear cups and the headbands snapped when I rested my head on one side. I bought the Sennheiser HD 202  as a replacement. The 202's are far better, and for a few dollars more a big improvement. I wish I'd bought the 202's in the first place. Please see my review of the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones for more information. I chose the Sony set because it seemed the least expensive headphone set. Spending less is only good if the product lasts long enough to receive value, these did not last.  If you are still considering this set, remember the Sony MDR V150 are actually very small diameter cups supra-aural, not circumaural. These are important distinctions to know when purchasing headphones. Circumaural will fit completely over and around the ears, not contacting the outer-ear parts. The supra-aural models look very similar (especially in photos), but are smaller in diameter and will fit with the pad contacting the outer-ear parts (penna). That contact flattens the outer-ear against the skull, causing pressure. My motivation for moving to over-the-head sets from earbuds and plugs was to avoid irritation. Circumaural is the most comfortable choice for sensitive wearers. I gave these 2 stars because they are not useless. If you want an inexpensive set, they sound ok. If handled with care, they could work well enough. They are not uncomfortable, just found to be far less comfortable than the others, after comparison.
