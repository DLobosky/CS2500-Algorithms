Victor Frankenstein has always been the apotheosis of 19th Century atheism.  He is a man who has seized the means of creation and is intent of making himself the god of the 21st century.  Unfortunately, he is also very much a sadistic sociopath who sees his creations as disposable.  To be assigned tasks, used until worn out, disposed of if they veer from Frankenstein's compulsive perfectionism.  His plot is to replace key officials and flood the world with his manufactured humans.  When the time is right these will rise up and slaughter the rest of us.Koontz goes into considerable detail about the nature of Frankenstein's realm.  We see first hand the cruelty, disregard, and insane utopianism that are its spirit.  And under the surface, we see the mistakes.  Frankenstein's genetic manipulation and brain programming aren't perfect.  Stranger monsters lurk within the cultivated flesh, and others struggle with unexpected human needs to nurture and be cared for.  This is a frightening realm.  One that has spilled over into the human world and threatens its very existence.Against the 200-year-old mad doctor (now called Victor Helios) is a desperate and small team.  One is Deucalion, the first of Helios' creations - born in murder, left for dead, the intervening years have worked many changes, leaving the monster more human and determined to unravel Helios' plot.  Two humans work at his side - Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Maddison.  Much of their part in this novel is defensive.  As the investigation progresses, Helios becomes aware of the threat to his kingdom, and O'Connor and Maddison find themselves in a struggle to find clues and survive a string of assassination attempts.The writing is a bit more simplistic than in the first volume, possibly due to the use of a different co-author.  But even so the narrative runs smoothly.  And the characterizations of the citizen's of Helios' dark utopia, the recreation of an almost gothic empire are excellence.  Koontz understands that a horror story needs to be more than a catalog of violence to be a complete success.  And he also understands the philosophical implications must arise from the story, not drive it.  This is a story that can be read at several levels, and works equally well at all of them.
