There is a blue power LED on the front of the unit to indicate when its on. The very top knob, is the "treble" control. The middle knob, is the "base" control. And the bottom knob, is the "volume" control.I have the sub up against the wall, to the side of the tv. Both speakers are on either side of the tv, and the speakers power is plugged into a power strip. The first thing I did when I switched on my tv, is adjust the controls. I turned the tv up to volume level "50," as I feel this should be a loud listening level, I then adjusted the volume on the sub accordingly. I like to have the treble all the way up, as this system only gets so crisp.I then cranked up the base all the way up. However, I noticed that the sub was performing noises when it shouldn't and it was overdriving a bit on some parts such as music. This was actually good news, as it meant that it was able to get pretty powerful for its 4" driver size! To prevent damage to the sub, I turned the sub volume down a little bit. Once I got the adjustments just right, I put in the movie Space Balls.SUB UNIT: I only spent $28.00 dollars for this at Amazon. So, if I compare this to the sound of my $200.00 Logitech Z5300 sound system, of course I am going to be disappointed. However, when compared to the price I paid for it, and the fact it only has a 4" driver, I think it sounds incredible! Dude, I am totally not making this up, it really sounds great, and is a great addition to my shop tv system.It doesn't really provide a real hard pounding base, which is good, as you don't need that for movies. Its more of a low tone base, so it gets real low, which is great for movies, and things like explosions going off. Do I think it goes as low as my Z5300 system? No, absolutely not, but does it need to? If you live in an apartment, you can't have a system like that, so you will have to be happy with this one.SATELLITES: The smaller speakers are not capable of going as loud as my Z5300, or my home theater Sony system either. However, considering what they are rated to do, I think they do fine. Though I wish the treble could go up even higher with them, I am completely satisfied, and don't feel the need to return the unit. As far as how well these little speakers reproduce sound, I think they do quite well for their size. The mid-range does not sound half bad either and really compliment my system well.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, I don't think this is the best sound system by far, its obviously a low quality unit. However, I am absolutely amazed at how much sound I get out of this speaker system, definitely worth the price I paid for them! I would recommend this speaker system for to be used on tv's, or computers in which you watch movies on. I don't however, recommend them for music listeners or hardcore gamers. 3 out of 5
