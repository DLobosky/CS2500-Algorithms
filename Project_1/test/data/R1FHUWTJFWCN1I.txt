With Christmas coming up, my wife and I wanted to purchase a Webkinz for each one of our children, as a stocking stuffer.  My youngest daughter adores cats, so when my wife and I found the Webkinz Himalayan Cat here on Amazon, we just knew our daughter would love it.  Now then, I would like to ask you to look carefully at the picture posted here on the Amazon product page.  Notice how fluffy and cute this cat looks.  Now, please take a look at the product picture that I posted in the "Customer Images".  This is what my wife and I actually received in the mail from the retailer.  Now ask yourself, does that look even moderately cute?  The Webkinz Himalayan Cat we received looks like some sort of possessed junkyard cat!  The hair is all stringy and tangled, the tail is not fluffy at all, and the overall feel of the cat is not even moderately soft.  My wife feels that she can somehow comb out all of the knots and tangles, so she doesn't want me to send it back for a refund.  I sure hope she can make this cat look far better than it did when it arrived, because I definately will not give this item to my daughter the way it looks now.  It is honestly one of the ugliest, scariest looking stuffed animals I have ever seem in my life!I am still giving this toy two stars, because of the included tag that has a code for accessing the Webkinz website.  The animal itself may be an ugly mess, but at least my daughter will get a code to enjoy a year of playing with a virtual pet on Webkinz.  I feel that the makers of these Webkinz animals should package them in some sort of box or other package, which would prevent the hair from getting so matted and tangled in the stores and during shipping.  So in the end I guess we are keeping the Webkinz Himalayan Cat, at least for the use of the Webkinz access code.  However, I would certainly not purchase this particular animal again, and I do not recommend it to anyone.  If you think the product photo of the Himalayan Cat looks cute, as my wife and I did, be warned that there is a good chance you will be getting something that looks more like the customer image photo I have posted.  Webkinz produces some very cute animals, and there are a lot of better choices than this cat.  =o(
