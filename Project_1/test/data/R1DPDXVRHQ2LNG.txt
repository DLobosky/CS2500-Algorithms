The single most entertaining and successful film of the year "SHREK" (DreamWorks...), arrives on DVD in a double disc set that includes widescreen and full screen versions and bonus material skewed towards younger kids. The unusually sharp digital transfer is about as good as is technically possible and brings to life a beautiful world inhabited by all manner of questionable but mostly lovable characters. Mike Meyers' inspired voice work for the title ogre is dead on in every aspect and implies much more humanity than even the words he says.  Eddie Murphy is consistently in the zone as the up-beat, bluntly honest wise guy Donkey. Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow bring the princess and the vertically challenged king to life.  But the most interesting thing that looms over this hugely successful film is the personal war between Disney's Michael Eisner and DreamWorks' "Shrek" producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. The rivalry and bitterness between the two former Disney associates has resulted in several extraordinary animated products that are probably much better than they might have been.  Let's hope they keep competing on a personal level because "Shrek" is just about perfect.  Of all the bonus material, making of stuff and commentaries, the thing that's most lacking is something, anything, from the two brilliant writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. It's the best screenplay of the year.  By far.  One to own.
