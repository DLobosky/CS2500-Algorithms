This remake of a 1970s cult cassic is not as scary as it is compleatly disgusting.  The grosse-out fest begins in the first 20 minutes when the hitchhiker pulls a pistol out of her, uh, female genitalia.  Right when the chainsaw starts up a youngster gets his leg hacked off.  The phsycho with a skin disorder drags him to the basment and throws a hand-full of salt on the wound.  There are very few truly scary part, and most of them are the glimpes of the killer's deformed face.  I could'ent feel for the charecters that this town of hicks are bent on killing. Although, Jessica Biel is really hot.  If you have a weak stomach, leave this one be.  If you are a horror movie buff, rent the 1970s version and hold off until this one comes on cable.
