An an owner of both, I would like to offer my own comparison of the two, focusing on the topics that come up most frequently in Christian apologetics, namely the existence of God, the problem of evil, biblical contradictions, miracles, the resurrection, science and the Bible, etc.  Coverage by page count for the two volumes are as follows:_______________________________Baker Encyclopedia_____IVP's New DictionaryEvidence/Arguments for God____________32-1/2_________________11Problem of Evil________________________5-1/2__________________3-1/2The Resurrection______________________23-1/2_________________5Bible Criticism_________________________5-1/2__________________2Bible Difficulties/Errors__________________6-1/2__________________5-1/2Miracles_____________________________38_____________________5-1/2The Trinity____________________________7-1/2_________________3-1/2Views of Creation/Origins_______________15-1/2_________________4-1/2Science & the Bible_____________________9_____________________2Evolution______________________________9-1/2_________________2-1/2Big Bang Theory________________________4____________________1/2C. S. Lewis____________________________5_____________________1Salvation of Infants_____________________5-1/2__________________0In addition, the articles in the Baker Encyclopedia tend to be more structured, with sub-headings, text tables, and numbered lists, which make them much easier to follow and to browse.  The articles in IVP's New Dictionary are almost exclusively undifferentiated paragraphs of text.Furthermore, in the area that I am most familiar with (science & the Bible), the articles in the Baker Encyclopedia are much more informative and balanced.Therefore, between the two, I recommend Norman Geisler's Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics.
