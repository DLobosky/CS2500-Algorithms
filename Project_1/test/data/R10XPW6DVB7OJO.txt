This is a "greatest hits" album cd of the "modern version" of Lynyrd Skynyrd. It consists of 12 great songs, taken from their studio album cds from the 1990's. The songs are "Born to Run" (Their song not Bruce's song - Skynyrd's song is better), "One thing", "The Last Rebel", "Devil in the Bottle", "Edge of Forever", "Money Back Guarantee", 'FLA", "Smokestack Linghing", "I've seen enough", Travelin Man (with the late Ronnie Van Zant singing along), "Never too Late" and O.R.R. (Outlaws, Renegades, & Rebels). This is a great cd and a "must-have" for any Skynyrd fan!!! Thanks and may God Bless!!!
