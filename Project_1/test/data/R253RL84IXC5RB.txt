We also get to see Cro Cop take on Josh Barnett, which is also a highly anticipated fight. The rest of the fights could go either way, having little effect on the Pride divisions. Let's get to the action.Hirotaka Yokoi v. Heath Herring:They call Heath the "Texas Crazy Horse" over in Japan. He is a madman in there most of the time, which makes him an exciting fan favorite. He comes out blazing in this fight and the ref calls a timeout as Yokoi is taking knees to the head on the ground after being dropped. This is very strange. It all ends not too long after this point. This is a very good fight to kick off the event.Ricardo Arona v. Sergey Ignatev:Arona is coming back from being KO-slammed by Quinton Jackson, his only Pride loss. Arona looks great this time out and gets himself back on track with an excellent display of ground fighting technique. Arona lost his shot at fighting Wanderlei Silva for the title to Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, but he is determined to get back to top contender status. Alexandre Emelianenko v. James Thompson:This immediately turns into a wild slugfest. Thompson is making his Pride fighting debut. Do you think he makes a good showing or goes quickly down in flames in a matter of seconds?Alistair Overeem v. Hiromitsu Kanehara:Overeem had lost his last fight to the UFC's Chuck "The Iceman" Liddell by knockout. He is back in Pride and looking to re-establish himself. He dictates the pace of this lopsided fight. Kanehara doesn't give in, but he takes quite a beating to prove his heart.Dan Bobish v. Mark Hunt:Bobish is cut very early on by a knee. The fight is allowed to go on... This is a pretty decent fight, but you don't really see the best of Mark Hunt. We do get to see a very awkward knockout, though, which is always good.Dan Henderson v. Kazuhiro Nakamura:Dan Henderson is something of a wildman - inside the ring. Outside, he seems to be very stoic. We see the wildman again tonight and someone gets hurt...Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipovic v. Josh Barnett:This is Barnett's Pride debut...against Cro Cop... Should be awesome. Barnett talks trash before the fight. Cro Cop laughs it off, as usual. The fight BLOWS. You'll see what I mean. This was a huge letdown, given the buildup and gravity of this fight. Too bad it couldn't have gone differently. A rematch is offered after the fight and hopefully we will see it in time.Wanderlei "The Axe Murderer" Silva v. Quinton "Rampage" Jackson:This fight is ultra-hyped by Pride. The first time these two warriors met, Silva won in the first round. Jackson claims that Silva doesn't even hit hard and gives Chuck Liddell (who Rampage knocked out) more credit as a fighter. Jackson is on his cell phone during the playing of the Brazilian national anthem, showing no respect for Silva. I was dying to see this fight and it starts getting exciting around 2 minutes in. There is a lull in the action and then they are stood up, where they exchange and we see Silva fall to the mat. Silva turns the tide in the 2nd round and we see an amazing finish to this back and forth battle of the top middleweights in Pride Fighting. This is one of the better fights in Pride history! The DVD is a must-own.
