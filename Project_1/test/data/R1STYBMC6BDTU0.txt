This is also a very scary method to spend this much money and get nothing physical to show for it, right? Have no fear; the code works just as well if you get it electronically or on a plastic gift card. This is well near a brilliant plan for owners of Garmin GPS's. Pay one time; get up to four updates per year to your core GPS map software, for the life of your device. I've actually paid more than the price of this subscription to update one of my GPS's. So this was a no brainer for me.The part that is particularly tough, there are no instructions on how to actually use this code. The following will walk you through the steps to an update.First step - go to the Garmin Website and verify that the exact model of GPS you own is listed. Don't assume your model is listed - go to the website and verify it is really listed first. The list is huge, long, major long. Amazon also has a compatibility checker at the top of the product page. You can also email Garmin to be certain this will work with your model if you have separately purchased the European maps and added them to your GPS. Let me clarify the European Map deal - some models come with Europe built in, those will show up in the compatibility checker (a Nuvi 670 has NA and European maps installed from the factory). If you bought a unit that only has North American detail maps - this product WILL NOT add Europe to your unit. You must first purchase the European maps, install them, and then use this update subscription. Second Step - order this 'gift card' from Amazon and get the activation code. Third Step - make sure you know your MyGarmin user name and password - if not create an account. If you've had a GPS for longer than 1 year, you should have an account. Fourth Step - Plug your GPS into your computer with a USB cable. Go to the mygarmin website. Log into your account. And then select the MyMaps tab. Beside your GPS you will see a link for Activate Gift Card. You enter the code from Amazon in the box labeled Product Key. Now the automatic stuff happens. The product key is validated, and then starts the download process. First it checks your computer, then checks for your device, then checks for compatibility, and then launches a download manager. You will see a pop up and you'll have to give permissions like 10 times before the manager installs, and starts the download. Don't be afraid of the download manager. It's simple and only works with Garmin's website. It won't trash your computer. Now the part to be afraid of - my first update to my Nuvi 765T is 1.92Gb. So you darn well better have a very fast internet connection (my comcast connection did that download in around 20 minutes) or you'll need to start this up before you go to bed at night and just let it run. Last step, once the download manager has downloaded the whole file (you can check a box that says "close when done" and "launch when done"), click on Launch on the download manager box. The file will extract to the destination folder you set up in the early steps of download. Once extracted, the update program will run. The prompts there are simple and straightforward. I'm not sure what the update speed depends on, but they warn you it can take up to 2 hours. Mine updated in around 10 minutes. An important caveat that you cannot miss. This is for ONE GPS. ONLY ONE GPS. You cannot use this same code to update other Garmin GPS's. It does update both NA and Europe on that one device. You have to purchase a second card to update more units. Honestly, if you buy two updates to your GPS, this card pays for itself. I really love the "no questions asked" quarterly updates to my GPS. Type nuvi tips and tricks into your favorite search engine. The first hit is a resource on how to better use your Nuvi.
