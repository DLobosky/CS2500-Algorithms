If you touch up your chain before the chips are reduced to sawdust your work will be a lot easier.  I usually touch up the teeth after about an hour of cutting hardwood and two hours in softwood.For a touch up you will only need to make one or two strokes on each tooth as the provided file really cuts well.  If you have hit a rock or nail you will obviously need to file more but at least your day isn't over if you forgot to bring your spare chain.  Just remember to file all of the teeth the same amount or the chain will cut crooked.Saw shops usually take off about 2mm of steel from each tooth when they do the sharpening.  This really cuts into the life of the chain.  At $35 for a new chain plus $10 per sharpening this gets really expensive.This tool is inexpensive, requires no electricity, is light-weight, is easy to use (good instructions) and will save you a lot of time and money at the saw shop.  The gauge makes it easy for even a neophyte to cut the proper depths and angles.  What more can you ask?Remember to get the cutting depth gauge and flat file when you but this tool.  You will need it after a few sharpenings.
