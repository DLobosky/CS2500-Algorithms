This is a very unsatisfactory Kindle edition of Owen's work.  There is no table of contents, linked or otherwise, so that to find a poem you have to flick through them from the beginning.  But, worse, the poems are not formatted as verse but as prose, so that all the lines run together on the page.  This is the kind of quality that would have been criticised even in the early days of Kindle books and for a free edition.  To offer such a low standard in 2011, and to ask customers to pay for it, is completely unacceptable.  I hope the editors have the decency to issue an improved version and to offer free downloads to those who have bought this one.
