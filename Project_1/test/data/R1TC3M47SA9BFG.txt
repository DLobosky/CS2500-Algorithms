"The Mask of Cthulhu" is a collection of a handful of Lovecraftian Mythos stories written and published in the 1940s and 1950s by August Derleth. Although Derleth published over a dozen short stories and one novel as "posthumous collaborations" with Lovecraft, all of the stories contained here are credited to Derleth alone. Nevertheless, they are all knee-deep in the Mythos tradition that Lovecraft created and which people like Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard and Derleth himself fleshed out further.The fairest comparison for this book is probably "Watchers out of Time," the collection of "collaborations" between Derleth and Lovecraft. If you enjoyed one book, you'll (mostly) enjoy the other. Both are exceptionally well-written, and Derleth is an easy-to-read and commercial writer - just the thing you need if you read during your commute. There are a few things in favor of this book - since Derleth is freed from the pretense to carrying on Lovecraft's style the stories are both longer and are written in a more Derlethian style than those in "Watchers." Since all the stories here were previously published in magazines such as "Weird Tales" (whereas many of those in "Watchers" made their first appearance in Derleth's edited book "The Survivors and Others")you'd be right in assuming they pack more of a punch and are more satisfying fiction. As a rule, stories that survive the scrutiny of an objective editor are stronger than those that do not. To me, there are three standouts:"The Return of Hastur" in which the contents of a last will are not properly honored."Something in Wood" in which we're presented with a mysterious miniature idol."The House in the Valley" in which an artist in a secluded house descends into madness.On the negative side, it's in these stories that Derleth starts to do several things that drive many Lovecraft fans up the wall. Firstly, there is an over-reliance not only on name-checking places and things such as Innsmouth and the Necronomicon at every opportunity but also in leaning on the implied, steady presence of the malevolent Cthulhu himself far too often. Rather than remain in the background as local color, this technique brings the Mythos front and center where it draws attention to itself. Secondly. Derleth editorializes regarding the Mythos and conceives of them as an elaboration of pre-Adamic history from Christian theology which is radically at odds with how Lovecraft himself presented the Mythos in stories such as "At The Mountains of Madness" and "The Call of Cthulhu." Weirdly enough, this doesn't affect how the stories unfold one bit, but the sermonizing stands out because it's so out of place and isn't well-integrated within the stories.In sum, this is well-worth a read and exceptionally atmospheric but be skeptical of Derleth's additions/revisions to the Mythos when he gets on a soapbox!
