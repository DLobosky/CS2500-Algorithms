This is a modern retelling of a young girl chosen to birth a child of God and her best friend who struggles with the idea of actually believing her.I enjoyed the beginning of the book immensely, but as it went on I lost interest. I felt there was too much religion for my taste and that took me away from the story after a while. Also, I did not feel like there was a lot of development of the characters and the story where they should have been, so I felt I had to force myself through the book to finish it.I did like the differing POVs of the story. I felt this book was unique in how the story was happening around Ivy versus happening to her. Virginia was a great character and I enjoyed getting into her head in each chapter. I really liked the cover of this book as well. The artists' rendering of the wings was spectacular, which is what originally drew me to the book.I would recommend this book to those who appreciate the Bible and religion, because there is a lot of that intertwined in the story, but personally I did not enjoy it.
