Chenier is carrying on the tradition of his father - the legendary zydeco musician Clifton Chenier (who died in 1987). And this album - recorded in one session shows he's got the talent - as well as the producing skills - to do it. Four of the songs came from the younger Chenier, including the title track and "Hot Tamale Baby", while the variety of the other tunes is wide. Boozoo Chavis's "Paper in my Shoe" is, of course, in the zydeco realm, but who would have expected a Tom Waits song (!) - "Clap Hands"- on a Louisiana music album (especially an accordion-based one)? And the closing track - Curtis Mayfield's "We Gotta Have Peace" is another; this one with a world peace message.The package is nicely designed too, with a 16 page book of lyrics to the songs.I've played this a few times already and it gets better each time. If you like Zydeco, you can't go wrong here. Obviously, the talent is being passed down to the next Chenier generation.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
