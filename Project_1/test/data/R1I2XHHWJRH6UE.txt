But I love its functionality -- I bought a previous version two years ago for my 3rd-generation iPod Touch and now this one for my iPhone 4S.It slips on or off in two seconds (literally), fully covering the back (except the camera) and perimeter (except the mic/speaker) while leaving the screen exposed and the vibrate switch and USB/earphone jacks accessible. The on/off and volume buttons are covered yet respond perfectly to pressure/touch through the case. It's practically weightless and adds minimal bulk (increases my iPhone from approx. 4-1/2-inch x 2-1/4 x 3/8 to 4-3/4 x 2-1/2 x 5/8). It shows no smudges or fingerprints (but is washable if there's a need) and feels good in the hand -- the supple rubberized material creates some drag so the device won't slip out of your grasp or slide off a table. Highly recommended.
