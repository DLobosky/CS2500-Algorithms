Too often for beginning readers, stultifying rhyme and brain-numbing text turn off the brain. This is vibrant, with the left page using rhymed phrases (you will NOT find Pat Sat On The Fat Cat!!!) that feel exciting and natural, good language for early readers. The refrain (or chorus) is on the right hand page, and best of all everything is in large print! The only thing missing is a list of other titles in the series.
