James Taylor has given us so many wonderful albums over the last couple of  decades (Gee, is it thirty years already?) that it truly surprising to see  him come up with yet another blockbuster of a song cycle as he has produced  here. From the opening bars of "Copperline", a dreamy recollection of why  it is we can never go home again to the comical yet thoughtful "Frozen  man", in which Taylor playfully cautions us about the dehumanizing  possibilities science is beginning to confront us with, there isn't a dog  in the bunch. As always, this is an eclectic mixture of folk ballads like  "Native Son" and "The Water Is Wide" to an excellent cover of old favorite  "Everybody Loves To Cha Cha Cha" to contemporary songs like "Got to Stop  Thinking `Bout That". What we have here, folks, is a guarantee of  entertaining, superbly rendered, and always memorable music by one of the  old masters of popular folk-rock. After all, "JT" has now successfully  negotiated the fifty-year mark, and like the rest of us boomers, shows no  sign of slowing down or repeating himself. Enjoy!
