This just came in the mail to me toady, and I love it. This is such a nice huge bottle to toss my change in. I did have an NFL bank, and that's filled up and I needed a new bank. What surprised me is the size of it, it's huge.  Much bigger than the NFL back I was using, and that wasn't small.  I also love it because it looks like a giant coke bottle.  :O)  This would make a great gift for yourself, or if you want to give this to your child or grandchild, and watch it with them, and they fill it up.  This is also a wonderful way to teach your child or grandchild about money, and how to save it.
