I'm all too familiar with Dominican hair products, however, I was looking around for a Brazilian hair product which name I cannot recall, sounds like Nads, Nat's or Nats (btw, not the hair  removal lotion), when I came across this product.  My hair needed help after doing an ApHogee protein treatment for my 3b/c chemically-altered-hair, my hair is now in worse condition than before I did the apHogee regimen, it is now dryer and more brittle.  The consistency depicted on this treatment pleased me which is why I decided to order it, very thick.  The product arrived in great condition well packaged and overly sealed (much appreciated).  The bottle is huge for such a reasonably low price which is surprising to me.  Also surprising, is how this treatment leaves one's hair so silky, tangle-free and soft. My hair is strange, I think the deal is that my hair reacts positive to NEW product application or perhaps it is quite possible that this product is actually a decent product.  Who knows? (rhetorical) Future update will follow (someday)...
