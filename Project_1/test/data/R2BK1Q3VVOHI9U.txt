Having David Lean's Oliver Twist on a Criterion Collection DVD is a dream come true.  I've loved this film since I first saw it but was able to see more of it thanks to Criterion.  The film has always had a crackly scratchy sound to it and the film was so dark the pictures were difficult to see.  Criterion cleans up the negative and shows the film with crisp sound and a great picture.  It is very enjoyable and less difficult to make out.  If you haven't seen the film, it is definitely one you should.
