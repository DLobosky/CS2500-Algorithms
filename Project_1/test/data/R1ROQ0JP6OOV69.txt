Publius Ovidius Naso's "Fasti" (calendar) is undoubtedly his most neglected piece of literature.  It is justifiably belittled by his timeless epic the "Metamorphoses," it stands out as dull and lifeless when compared with the bawdy and lusty "Amores" and "Ars Amortoria," and it never reaches the emotional appeal of his famed "Heroides."  Although the "Fasti" is a rich storehouse for Roman astronomy, religion, and ritual.  And at times--mostly in the prologues to each of the calendars' months--Ovid takes his poetry to a level of creativity and depth that rivals his other poems; but unfortunately these are only short-lived.  Another setback to the "Fasti" is the fact only six months out of the calendar year remain (January to June).  It is up to question whether or not they were ever finished or simply didn't survive through the centuries; but nonetheless this misfortune is yet another hard knock for the "Fasti."  It is certainly difficult to give Rome's most profound poet such a low rating, but when this is sized up with his other works, it doesn't stand a chance.
