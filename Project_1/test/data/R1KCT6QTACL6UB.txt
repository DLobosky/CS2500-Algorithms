Dubbed by Newsweek magazine as &quot;the most exciting individual in the American theater,&quot; actress/playwright Anna Deavere Smith gives empathetic reading to this landmark narrative.  Known for her portrayal of Nancy McNally on the popular TV show &quot;The West Wing,&quot; Smith has also written and performed two one-woman plays pertaining to racial issues in America.				It is one thing to read about the injustices of slavery from a historical or even an observer's point of view.  It is quite something else to learn of the daily life of a slave in the indentured person's own voice.  Such is the case with &quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative&quot; penned by a female slave in the 1850s.	According to the editor this manuscript has existed for 140 years, and is quite probably the &quot;earliest known novel by a female African-American slave and the earliest known novel by a black woman anywhere.&quot;  Also according to Mr. Gates a slave escaped from a North Carolina plantation in 1857 and was able to reach New Jersey.  It is his contention that she is the author of this book.	Whether one wishes to question the authenticity of his identification or not is quite immaterial considering the compelling material within &quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative.&quot;  The relationship between ladies' maids and their mistresses is revealed in sharp detail, as are the offensive overtures by a relentless master.  The slave and narrator is presented not as a human being but as chattel, valued only for what she might bring on the block.	         - Gail Cooke
