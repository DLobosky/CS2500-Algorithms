Nicholas Cage running through the woods in a bear outfit, his bear claws clocking women in the face, etc.)... show the extended version of the 1974 film. This set contains both versions. The extended version is the version I show to people watching this movie for the first time. Again, don't watch the recent remake with Nicholas Cage if you haven't seen the original first. It will destroy the first-time experience of one of the greatest horror films of all time. After the first viewing of the extended version, you can compare it to the theatrical version, then go to the recent remake for some laughs.This is Christopher Lee's finest, though he made a fine Saruman in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The extended version contains additional scenes of Lee and Edward Woodward. By the way, Edward Woodward is the man of the hour in the original, a very honored guest. Acting like you wouldn't believe, and again, more Woodward to enjoy in the extended version.
