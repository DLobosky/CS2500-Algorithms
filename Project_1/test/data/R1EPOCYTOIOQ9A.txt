I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories.  However, there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary.  Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the  politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard  to follow and identify with otherwise.  I had difficulty empathizing with  any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there  are so many characters in the story.  However, there are several hot scenes  in the book and therefore it may be worth the time and money to purchase  the book.
