This movie is everything you could want in a Disney film!  It's cute, charming, sweet, funny, entertaining; has great classic-style animation, comfortable, familiar characters, and an important message at the end:  Family is all about LOVE (and if you don't have any REAL family, really good friends will do in a pinch)! A QUICKIE SUMMARY OF THE PLOT: This is the FIRST Winnie The Pooh movie that centers around everyone's favorite comedy relief character:  T-I - DOUBLE GRRR -ER!  (And Tigger has NO problems hogging the lime-light for a change)!  In the story, Tigger, who evidently is tired of &quot;being the only one&quot; gets the urge to bounce around with others of his own kind.  Suddenly feeling kind of down in the dumps about not having any REAL family, he seeks out Owl for advice (because, after all, Owl is an &quot;expert&quot; when it comes to &quot;family trees&quot;)! I won't tell you how it all turns out (in case you can't figure it out for yourself!) but it also includes a really COOL Tiggerific MUSIC VIDEO, which my five year old daughter is absolutely CRAZY about! SO, HOW DID OUR FAMILY LIKE THE MOVIE? IT'S UNANIMOUS!  We ALL loved it!  It's just a really, really cute movie!  If you haven't yet seen it, rent it tonight.  Afterwards, you may decide to just add it to your Disney collection.  (We did)!  Ta-ta for now!
