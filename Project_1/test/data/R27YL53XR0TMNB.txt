 In some cases, what Covey says the rest all say. The biggest difference is the process, not the method.
 
 In audio form, it lacks. The listener, who may be commuting, is not able to process the ideas. What works as a book is less effective as audio. This is by no means a criticism of Covey's challenges, but of the device he uses to impart them.
 
 Covey's "Seven Habits" are like eating properly during the gestation of your baby. The short-term results are hard to realize, but the foundation for good health are laid. Follow what Covey says, and in the long-term, you will be highly effective.
 
 Covey starts with explaining that the first step isn't external, but internal. It isn't just that Covey is trying to get you to feel good about your abilities. Instead, he wants you prepared for the hard work the seven habits will require. In fact, Covey deplores the cheap 'character ethic' method, noting it evolved away from character, and more into quick-fix influence techniques.
 
 He separates influence and character, and wants the reader to know influence without character is not good. "Only basic goodness gives life to technique." The book is not a lesson in technique.
 
 The Seven Habits are divided into chapters:
 1- Be Proactive
 2- Begin with the End in Mind
 3- Put First Things First
 4- Think Win/Win
 5- Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
 6- Synergize
 7- Sharpen the Saw
 
 Covey, despite how it is a management and professional growth book, has also written a personal growth book. It is not a relationship book, as in the sense John Gray writes, or a weight loss book, like Dr. Phil writes. Fans of "Who Moved My Cheese" by Johnson will connect.
 
 Though Covey won't charge at the reader by asking him to repeat a mantra of "I think I can. I think I can," he does show the reader the ways of realigning their perspective, their goals and their strengths for the greater good of both the listener, and those he interacts with.
