Think of 9/11. It was at first a bright and sunny morning with no clouds in the sky. Suddenly you see a plane crash into a building and smoke is everywhere.Some people watching it on TV would have been terrified by it. But then these brave dogs ran into the dark smokey building and didn't mind. They found people,kids and cats and other dogs and brought them to safety. See the true story of lots of dogs on Steptember 11 2003.
