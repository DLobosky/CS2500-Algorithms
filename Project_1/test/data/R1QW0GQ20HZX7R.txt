So far, this is my favorite novel by Ms. Rose.The plot is solid, the suspense addictive.  The characters are strong and compelling, and not as sappy as the characters in her earlier tales. There is still a lot of lip twitching, which tends to irritate me after twenty or so occurrences.  However, I believe this author has grown a great deal.I truly enjoy dealing with and revisiting some of the same characters that populated Ms. Rose's previous works.  I hope David Hunter gets his own story down the road because he is an interesting character.Shelley Dawn, author of Dark Nights and Sweet, Sweet Jessie
