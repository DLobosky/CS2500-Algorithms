Walking with Leslie Sansone" contains two indoor walking exercising programs: a one mile "gentle" walking program and a two mile "brisk walk". Each walk is hosted by Leslie by herself and features a clock in the left-hand corner of the screen that counts down the minutes left in the program. Also included on the DVD are five mini walk/workout tips (Leslie mentions in the introduction a three mile walk but that is not included on this DVD).One Mile Gentle Walk:This is a nice energetic one mile walk that takes about 21 minutes (Leslie says it is a 15 minute walk but the 21 minutes include the warm-up, cool down, and stretches). The routine includes Leslie's four basic steps: walk in place, side steps, kicks, and knee lifts, as well as kick backs, walking forward and back, and upper arm movements. What I like about this one mile walk is that Leslie incorporates a few movements that make this a gentle yet somewhat brisk walk: double side steps, double knee lifts, and tap outs. Not only does it make you feel good about the one mile exercise but helps prepare you for some of the steps when you are ready to tackle the two mile walk.Two Mile Brisk Walk:This is a nice two mile indoor walk (it takes approximately 32 minutes to do) that gets your heart rate up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something at the end of the routine. Again it features Leslie's four basic steps as well but also adds in kick backs; double side steps; single knee lifts/double knee lifts/four knee lifts; side steps where you put your heel down in front; and tap outs that turn into lunges. Each mile takes about 15 minutes to complete and the second mile is more intense than the first. The cool down period lasts about five minutes including two and a half minutes of stretches. All of this makes for a nice brisk exercise program.Five mini walk/workout tips:These tips include Beginner Stretching; Brisk Walk Alternative for Beginners; Easy Walk to Stay Flexible; What Makes a Power Walk; and Anatomy of a High Knee March. Each of these is very brief (less than three minutes) and I really didn't find any useful information included.Summary:"Start! Walking with Leslie Sansone" contains two very good exercise routines for both beginners and long-time Leslie Sansone fans.
