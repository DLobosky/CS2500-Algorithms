This autobiography was originally released in hardback in 1995.  In it, Betty shares the full extent of her personal and professional history from her beginnings in the industry through the early 1990s.  Included are the facets of her life that we are most familiar with:  "Password," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Golden Girls," her devotion to third husband Allen Ludden, and her love of animals of all kinds.  Her memoir might be most valuable for its insights into the early days of television. Imagine cramming a five-hour program with interviews, skits, and commercials -- all performed live and in front of just one camera!  Or working on holidays, just like regular days, in order to faithfully entertain the audiences at home.  Over the decades, there were numerous opportunities to star in sit-coms, to host parades, and of course, to participate in game shows, one after another.  The woman has had quite the busy life.  We get the impression that she has always liked it that way. Though it would be easy to accuse Betty of name-dropping on every page, the fact remains that she has worked with and has been friends with some of the most famous actors and producers in the history of the medium.  She takes the high road here and does not dish much about any of them.  And her career has been so jam-packed that she cannot dwell on any particular topic or any show for very long.  As a result, her approach must by necessity be a tad shallow when it comes to chatting about some of our favorite people or enterprises.  But she does offer somewhat generous detail about her family life:  from holding a home base in California with her parents, to moving to NYC to be with Allen Ludden and his three children.  Tons of black and white photographs accompany the narrative.In the 15 years since this book was released, Betty White has added even more credits to her resume.  She has been part of several short-lived sit-coms, has made guest appearances on a wide variety of shows, and has won yet another Emmy.  Now TVLAND's "Hot in Cleveland" seems to be reinvigorating her popularity.  "Here We Go Again," indeed!  Read this book if you want to reminisce about the old days of the black and white broadcast.  Revisit that magical world that created wonderful actresses like Betty White.
