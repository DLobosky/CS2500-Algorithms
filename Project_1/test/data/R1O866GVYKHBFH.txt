I have and enjoy many of the workouts that include utilization of the props, but their use typically slows the pace of the walking during that section.  This workout features some of the regulars that those of you who have been doing Leslie for a while will recognize:  Carol, Jo, Linda, Mary Kay - as well as her 14 year old daugher, Marie, and 20 year old niece, whose name I can't recall.  These women don't seem to be aging, but improving, so if it's the walking doing it for them, I'm "in"!  I bought this DVD for the 3 mile workout, which actually clocked out to take place in about 38-40 minutes, with the stretch taking up the remaining workout time listed.  The workout is high energy and everyone seems to be having giddy fun.  The only reason I rated it a 4 is because this is not one of Leslie's best cueing jobs.  She typically does a pretty good job of cuing, but there were numerous places where even her "class" was caught off guard - and one place where she apologizes.  It doesn't detract at all from the workout - and if you've been doing her workouts for a while, you'll be able to follow along.  After all, as she repeatedly tells us, you can't do these workouts wrong.  I mention this mainly for those who are considering this as their first purchase.  If you start out with the 1 and 2 Mile Walk, by the time you work up to the 3 mile, you'll be a veteran and won't be troubled by this at all.  However, if this is the first workout you do, this one is not really indicative of her usual cueing.  All that said, I'll take the few very minor flubs that come with this infectiously fun workout any day.  As I've said before in other Leslie Sansone reviews, when a friend told me about these workouts, I thought walking in front of your TV was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  But I tried one and got hooked.  I find these workouts easier on my sensitive feet and I get more mileage in than when I use my treadmill.  There is no fancy footwork to learn - if you can walk, side step, lift your knees and kick, you can do this workout ... and if you don't want to do those things, just keep marching.  It really is that easy. If you've never exercised before, this is a great way to start - and if you're already regularly exercising, check out the reviews to find the ones that are a little more demanding.
