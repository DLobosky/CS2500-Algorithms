This is the third book of Mr. Zandri that I have read and they are all fantastic. He has a way with words and he will grab you from the first page. He has a talent for incorporating the past and the present in his novels that is not confusing. All of the characters were developed fully and I felt that I was right there in the prison with the inmates. Jack had a troubled past and he has to prove that he was one of the good guys. There was corruption, suspense, romance and action that kept me engaged throughout the whole book. I finished the book very quickly and I was looking for more. I look forward to reading the next book in the series Godchild.
