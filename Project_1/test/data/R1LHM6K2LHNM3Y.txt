Paid $99.99 two months ago for this digital recorder.  I'm a frequent user.  It's my backup for my work.  Today it froze and it's stuck in the "Please Wait" mode.  It won't turn off.  It won't turn on.  It won't charge.  It won't do anything at all.  It's frozen.  I have about 3G worth of recordings on there that I can no longer access.  It's not worth a nickel if it won't work.  It's now a plastic piece of garbage and I wouldn't recommend this brand or this product to anyone.
