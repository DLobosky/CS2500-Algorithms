I ... He presents his wife in this book as someone who cannot get better. He does not discuss treatment. He does not seem to have a real clue as to what the BPD really is and that is a neurobiological medical disorder. A brain disorder needing medication.He discusses Gunderson's work which is good but old. It would have been helpful for the author to have done some recent research before writing the book to provide hope to families and borderlines. The book leaves one with a feeling of no hope and leaves families with thoughts that borderlines should be left.It is important to note that not all borderlines are alike. His depiction of his wife and how the BPD is expressed in her life will be very different from another person with the BPD.It was stated in the book that BPDs are manipulative which is incorrect. This was thought at one time but we know now is untrue. Here again, we look at the research and not at what others tell us.This book is dangerous for borderlines and families to read because of the reasons above. Leads one to believe there is no hope, no treatment, BPD partner has no mental health issues and blaming the BPD for everything.For an M.D. in the field of psychiatry as the author, he flunked badly. The only way that he can do a "make-up exam" is by doing an intense self examination - what was going on with me inside for my life to become so out of control during that time period; why would I give up control of my life to another human being; what is it about me that needs to feel I can control another human being; etc? This is where healing comes from for BPD families, not from this author's perspective.It is important to remember that we attract those who are functioning on the same level emotionally. If we find ourselves with a mate who has a mental health disorder, chances are we are not well either. What is important is not to focus on your partner to move ahead, but to focus on yourself asking yourself what is it about you that is not well and what will it take to become a happy and healthy person?Families of the BPD many times make the mistake that this author has and that is to continue to focus on the borderline to improve one's life as if happiness is all up to the borderline and the partner is "fine." Untrue.
