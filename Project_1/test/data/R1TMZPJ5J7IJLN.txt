Love Gun contains one of the best lead guitar solos ever recorded on Ace's "Shock Me" and two great songs from Gene, "Plaster Caster" & "Christine Sixteen". Unfortunately this is the last album by Kiss that be considered a true group effort. I would actually rate it 4 1/2 or 5 stars if it was not for the sappy, Phil Spector-ish "Then She Kissed Me".This album hold up & invites multiple listens even after 25 years. A must have for any hard rock fan.
