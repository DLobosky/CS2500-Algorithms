Just as a point of interest to those of you looking at this saw.  Do yourself a favor and go and review the ridgid r4510.  i owned a bosch 4100 and thought it was great until someone stole it from my shed.  Well, because of my deductable i was not covered and had to look for a new one.  I had read the review of the Ridgid r4510 and decided to look at both. Actually, i compared all of them and eliminated most except the Ridgid and the Bosch.  I fully expected the bosch to be the better of the two due to it being one hundred dollars higher in price..   I did every comparison possible.  took them apart, re-assembled them, folded them, closed them,  compared the fences rolled them around,  raised and lowered the blades and tilted the blade.  In the end, I found the ridgid to be a better value and easier and more accurate.  First of all, the fence on the bosch chatters when you move it,  My old one did and this new one did also.  Doesn't seem like a big deal but it is frustrating.  I lived with it on my old saw but when i moved the Ridgid fence i was really surprised.  Smooth as hell.  Also, the Ridgid has a micro-adjust feature on the fence itself which is a real advantage.  the ridgid folds easier and folds completely flat and upright which makes for easier storage.  I used it to trim some doors and i was truly impressed.  It also is guaranteed for as long as you own the saw which is a real plus.  Check them out  yourself,  the Rigid is sold by home depot and the bosch by lowes.  Both were within two minutes of each other and that made it easy for me, but, take the time and you will be surprised.  One other thing.  the guys at Lowes didn't know squat about the machine.  Just make sure you get the new model with the split guard.  there are still some old ones out there and they have the old guard which was not very effective.  The new guard seemed to be exactly the same on both the ridgid and the bosch.  Really, the ridgid had more features and was 100 dollars less.  Also, if you are a veteran of the military, both home depot and lowes give you a ten percent discount......nice bonus.  Good luck.  But either will serve  you well.
