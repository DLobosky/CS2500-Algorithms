I bought my favorite (ok, the only flavor I'll ever drink) Slim-Fast through here in an effort to save money.  I'm always buying the Creamy Milk Chocolate Slim-Fast but only sometimes on sale.  Much to my delight, I discovered I could indeed save a little money buying bulk & having it shipped.  I'm still going through it but when I'm done, I'll be checking on here to buy it again - assuming I still can get a good deal.
