This book gives you detail after minute detail on exactly how to persuade anyone . . . even those who don't want to be persuaded.Hogan and Speakman have unmasked and detailed some of the most effective persuasion techniques ever tested today. What I really like is the way that they tell you about the technique, show you exactly how to apply it step by step and then walk you through exercises that make the new knowledge yours.This is a guidebook, a treatise on persuasion and an eye opening exploration into what is possible when persuasion is systematically and ethically applied.One of the most interesting sections in the book is the Persuasive Language patterns and the $10,000 persuasion trick.I also enjoyed this book as a guidebook to predicting human behavior and the tactics and strategies for predicting outcomes will bring you back time and again as you practice them and experience their effectiveness.An amazing book and a must read for every serious persuader.Dave LakhaniAuthor - Persuasion: The Art of Getting What You Want and The Power of an Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour a Week.
