Someone comes to Chet in hopes he can find their brother in time for the big football game.  Chet takes the case. He has to solve the case, save the school, and oh, he has no plans on skipping lunch.   That's all I want to say about the plot, I don't want to spoil anything. This series is so funny, I actually found myself laughing out loud at what Chet was doing and what he was up to. The Author has a fantastic writing style.  The style is set up as if we're watching an old time detective move. The writing is crisp, quick and refreshing. The author does something a lot of children's authors don't do, and that's keeping the ages of his readers in mind.  It's right on their level, and will keep adults engaged.I tell my students about this series.  If you want your kids to read, then this is a great series to start with. I love it and can't wait to read more of them to see what Chet is up to.If your kids start this series, I can promise they'll be hooked.
