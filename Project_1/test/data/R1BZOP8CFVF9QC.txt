Icelandic Sagas are truly the best of Medeival literature.  They are much easier for modern readers (and therefore more entertaining) than the epic-heroic poetry which was standard throughout the rest of Europe. Other reviewers have already said plenty about this saga.  I just wanted to note that Laxdaela Saga is included in the collection "The Sagas of Icelanders" also published by Penguin Classics.  That's the version I own.  It seems that many of the sagas from that collection are also published in single volumes.  If you're interested in sagas, the bigger book is a much better value than buying them all seperately.
