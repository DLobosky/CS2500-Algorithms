This is not the first Kingston flash drive that I have had. The one that I had before was 16 GB and also very nice with my mac. However, it does not have the feature that I like most on this flash drive... The protective cover that loops around the entire drive (a whole 360) ! I don't have to worry about losing the cap anymore. The key loop is small, but it is a good size for a string to hold it with. The price is great on amazon too, especially considering the free shipping.
