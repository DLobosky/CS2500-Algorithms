I especially found the outside pockets more useful than the inside ones to put all my smaller things. The outside pockets all close up either with velcro or zippers which is great. Because the outside pockets are pouches and not slit pockets found on other tool bags, you gain a lot more storage room beyond the standard specs of this bag (26x14x14).As for the inside, you will lose a slight bit of storage room due to the rails for the retractable pulling handle, but not very much. What I think is neat are the two padded side pockets which look like gun holsters, but obviously made for drills. I used one of the pockets to hold my Makita drill and the other one for my Arrow staple gun. These two holsters have a velcro strap to hold the tool in place. Near the top on the other side are 3 more inner pockets which appear designed to hold Makita 18v 3.0ah batteries. I used a couple of those pockets exactly for that purpose.Quality-wise, I can tell this bag is made of strong material. I think somewhere I found info saying it was made of 600 denier material. I have looked around at similar bags which had 600 denier and I do have to agree this bag looks like 600 denier. It definitely looks durable and when I loaded it up with about 50 pounds of tools, I picked it up by the straps and can tell this sucker is super strong. Keep in mind there are 1680 denier bags out there and this bag is not as thick as those, but it's definitely thick enough and is plenty strong already.Just like other reviewers, I wonder how strong the telescopic rolling handle is because it seems no different from the telescopic handles used in typical luggage, but the bag itself is top quality. I tried rolling the fully loaded bag around and it seems to be ok.I read other reviews about the zipper. I don't know which part of the zipper broke on them and which part they said was plastic. The actual zippering mechanism (the slider?) I got was metal, but the zipper itself I can't tell if the teeth are plastic or not; looks like it's made of some kind of nylon material; don't think it's metal. I do have to say the zipper (not the slider) looks a bit thin, but it seems there is no stress on it when I lift the bag so I don't think it's going to be a problem for me unless I really try to overstuff this bag and close the top.Overall, this is a top quality bag and fits my needs.
