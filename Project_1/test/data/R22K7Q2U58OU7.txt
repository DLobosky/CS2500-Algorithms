My opinion, as a review should be, is that this moveie should be rented. I bought it for several reasons....1)The Game and Fight Club are by the same director and I own them as well. Both are among my top 5 movies...2)This movie was originally released as a superbit release3)All these reviews giving the movie a 4 or 5 star rating.Unfortunately, I just had a slew of people over to view it in DTS on a big screen WEGA TV and it was lacking alot of what I saw in Fight Club and The Game. The movie was not a suspense film. When compared the Signs and the Sixth Sense, I would almost say there was no suspense at all. I recognize the movie as a thriller. The forever passionate Jodie Foster did have her moments in the film, but the score didn't seem matched with the acting. It's like the composer wasn't even watching the movie while they were recording.There were alot of inconsistencies in the film. While it was noted in several scenes how much noise a footstep made in a largely empty wooden house, there were other scenes where a burgler would drop a heavy object or bag and no one heard it. I mean Jodie's awake, lying in bed and there isn't any other noise at all. At least a thud would be heard a few floors up, let alone the sound of normal and slightly raised conversation....In the end, it was agreed upon that the great film we bought before renting wasn't that great ...Hope that helps some of you out there who are Superbit supporters as well as Fincher. Almost forgot....the case was definately substandard.
