Brilliant and innovative at the time when it was first released, I can only compare watching this film today with watching a car wreck. Fascinating, it leaves you feeling empty. I don't mind senseless violence in the movies (one of my favorites is Romper-Stomper) but this movie is heartless and pointless. I give it three stars only for the ground braking role it played in the film making history.
