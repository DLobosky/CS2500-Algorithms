These DVD really helped him. My favorite part is the safety song which sings about not running in the street, and not going near the water without an adult's consent. My son used to have no fear of water (ugh!) but now he stays a few feet from the edge. Hurray! My son loves the DVDs, but even more so, often requests the bonus CDs that come with it. They make him very happy when we listen to them in the car.I think these DVDs are targeted towards children on the Autism Spectrum, but honestly, ALL children could benefit from this music learning.
