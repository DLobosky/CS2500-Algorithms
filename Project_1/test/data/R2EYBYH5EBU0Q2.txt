I purchased this set with the matching necklace and was very happy with the quality of both. As I mentioned in my review of the necklace, glass beads of this size and shape (heart) sell at a local bead shop for $3 each, not including gold plated bead spacers, beading wire or gold plated earring findings. It would cost $36 for the heart shaped glass beads alone! While this set would make a nice single gift for someone special, it can also make several gifts... 4 gifts as is, or up to 13 gifts if each heart from the bracelet was made into a pendant to be hung on a ribbon or satin cord. Very simple wire wrap using head pins can transform each heart into a pendant; it literally only takes minutes. Again, as other reviewers have stated, it's a nice gift all on its own, but for a very unique and special, affordable Mother's Day gift? Add the necklace. You couldn't make the set for the combined price. Plus, she won't see anyone else with her same ensemble!
