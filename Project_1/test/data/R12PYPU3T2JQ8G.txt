I bought this model from B&H due to its availability over amazon's. I love the 250 GB model as I prefer to have the capacity for all of my favorite applications, videos, and music on my tablets without having to switch the SD cards with the smaller capacity models. There are vast improvements over the Archos 70 250 G model which I also own. I would share some of the observations here :Initial SetupIt is pretty easy to run the setup as it navigates you through the steps the first time we powered it on. I ran into issues of not being able to connect to my home Wifi when I went through the initial setup. After I downloaded the latest firmware updates to my desktop and did a manual upgrade to the Archos 80 G9, everything ran fine. Interestingly, I ran into the same networking issues with the Archos 70. The instruction for upgrading the firmware manually is available on the Archos support website.Display and SoundThe display is much nicer  70 with a brighter screen and better viewing angle as compared to the Archos. However, it still does not match the quality of the more popular tablets like the Kindle Fire and Asus Transformer which I also own. The unit's speaker produces adequate volume but the quality is not great. I have no problem with the multi-touch screen and it seems to be quite sensitive. The Archos 80 G9 250 GB model weighs 23 oz vs 15 oz for the Archos 70, quite a bit heavier in comparison.System and stabilityThis Turbo version runs pretty fast and is quite noticeable when we run multiple applications including surfing on the internet. It is still not very stable as I occasionally had applications frozen which required a forced stop. Even though Archos claimed improvements on its hard drive performance for this model, I got occasional pauses while playing videos as the hard disk seemed to be busy buffering and streaming the video data. I hope the future firmware upgrades would take care of these issuesApplicationsThis is what I like the most as the Archos G9 has full Android market support. I had to side-load the Google Apps for the Archos 70 and it did not support applications like the Slingplayer (for remote viewing from our home DVR). With the Archos G9. I am able to download and run all of my previously purchased Google  market apps, including the Slingplayer. The 3G slot is a great addition particularly for traveling uses in European and Asian countries as we could buy SIMS card there for a relative low cost as compared to Wifi services there. The 3G USB slot can also be used to hooking up an external keyboard for added versatility.Battery usageThis model seems to consume more power and drain the battery faster than the Archos 70. I was able to use it for only a few hours before a full re-charge is needed.OverallI am happy with the Archos G9 250 GB model due to its vast improvements over the Archos 70. Archos seems to be the only tablet manufacturer which provides high capacity storage so the choice is clear if we want a tablet with the portability and capacity.
