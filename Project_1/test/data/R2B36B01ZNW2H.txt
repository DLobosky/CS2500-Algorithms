But I would like it to progress into something and that's what I was hoping for with Twice Bitten. Thank goodness Ms. Neill threw me a bone.What I Liked: Love the thick tension between Ethan and Merit! Things progress a bit and then there's some complications. I just love it, all of it. I can't wait to see where the next book picks up.We finally learn Merit's first name (yay!), but not the story behind it (boo). When I say `the story behind it' I mean that I want to know why she doesn't go by her first name. There has to be some sort of animosity going on and I want to know the cause behind it. It's kind of weird that she's not fond of her father yet she has taken his surname as her first. It's a bit confusing.I love this cover the best, so far. Merit loses the innocent look and looks fierce! I love her fighting outfit.What I Didn't Like: Still not loving Merit as a heroine but I have to admit, the girl is growing on me. She still has time to completely win me over.Overall Impression: Twice Bitten is my favorite book of the series so far. I was really happy with this one. I'm really anxious to read the next book, Hard Bitten, especially with the conflicting emotions from fellow book lovers. That bitterness and tang regarding the 4th book in the series is what got me to read this series to begin with. It's a good Urban Fantasy series. One I recommend you read if you like the genre.
