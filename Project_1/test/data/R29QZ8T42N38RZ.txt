Accoustic pianos are not a choice due to the size, weight, cost, and tuning requirements. I love the idea of a piano that is always in tune (and can move if we move), but I wanted to be sure I was teaching my kids in a way that they could easily play a grand piano if presented with one. The biggest concern is muscle memory, and making sure their fingers are used to the feel of a real key. Roland makes some of the top-of-the-line pianos, but they also come with a high cost. I am sure the sound might be a bit better, but I could not justify the expense. I tried out some of the higher-end Yamaha pianos, and while I was impressed, still was shocked at the cost. The P85 was the lowest cost Yamaha piano I tried that seemed it could be good for teaching. It sounded nice, feature the weighted keys with "graded hammer standard" (GHS), and was reasonably portable. However, I felt the P85 keys were a little hard to push with a little too much return. I had a higher-end Yamaha nearby (non-portable) and found the keys much better. The store also had a grand piano, and the higher-end Yamaha was much closer than the P85. With a little research, I discovered that the high-end Yamaha pianos (the ones that cost $2k and up) use "graded hammer effect" (GHE), a step up from GHS. Since the discontinuation of the P-140, the P-155 is the least expensive piano to support GHE. It also has 128 note polyphony, 14 voices with 4 tonal varieties, and support for a sustain pedal (you only need 1 pedal for most playing). What are the downsides to the P-155? Some other digital pianos have far more voices, more recording capability, and louder speakers. The P-140 only had 6-watt speakers.  This was improved with the P-155 (12W speakers), but it is still not the best.For the class of piano that this is, the improvements do not justify the price upgrade from the P-140 to the P-155, but if you are just starting out, there's no better piano for the price.  And if you can get a good used deal on a P-140, it will be just as good.
