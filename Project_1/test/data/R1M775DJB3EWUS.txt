The HowlingIn an attempt to get back into the Halloween spirit, I decided to watch "one of the best werewolf movies ever made" according to the Los Angeles. The Howling is a classic 80s horror film that took werewolf action to a new level. The modern era might look down on this movie due to its out-dated special effects. However, there is a great time to be had with The Howling.Karen White, a TV newscaster, is on the edge of catching a serial killer named Eddie. She is told to meet Eddie at a local adult shop. She arrives at the shop and enters a theater booth. In the booth, she is assaulted by Eddie. Karen narrowly escapes due to the police arriving just in time. Eddie is shot and assumed dead. Karen is traumatized by the event and has breakdowns just thinking of what happened in the booth. Her doctor suggests taking time off at a secluded retreat known as "The Colony." "The Colony" is not what it appears to be though. Many hairy secrets are hidden underneath the anomalous characters living in "The Colony."I doubt I am going to spoil the story for anyone when I say that Werewolves are the huge secret. Karen Shaub, a fellow reviewer, asked me not to use the word cheesy in my reviews anymore, so I will try to use other words to describe these furry beasts. The Werewolves epitomize the archetypal 80s style monster. Clearly, you cannot expect Underworld type visuals from this 80s classic. The Werewolves are frequently men in imaginative Werewolf costumes. The transformations, while detailed, lasted far too long and came off as ridiculous. The Werewolves might have been good for their time, but are nothing compared to some of today's CG marvels.The acting in this movie is decent. Sometimes you will deal with overacting or under acting. At one point, Karen's best friend is killed. Karen sits in sorrow for less than a second and continues what she is doing. Music works to perfection. Suspense is created with the sound track. Even those who are not usually afraid of 80s horror will find themselves jumping every now and then.This DVD is a dual-sided disk packed with extras. On the side with the film, you can listen to a commentary track with the director and others. The other side of the disk is jam packed with good extras. There are many making of features. There are also deleted scenes and outtakes. There are trailers and a photo gallery. This pulls The Howling up to a four-star rating. Pick this one up to satisfy you 80s horror craving.
