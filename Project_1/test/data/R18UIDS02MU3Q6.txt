On occasions the images were appropriate to the action, at other times they seemed purely decorative. I cannot understand the reason for the participation of a line of extras mimicing Siegfried's actions during the forging scene. Additionally the almost mechanical forest scene looked quite unattractive and the articulated dragon was a bit of a flop.The singing:Lance Ryan in the all important part of Siegfried has a steady and strong voice but his tone is somewhat unatractive and lacks the glowing radiance that is found in the great exponents of the role. The rest of the cast are very good with excellent performances from Wotan (Juha Uustalo) and Brunnhilde (Jennifer Wilson).The conducting: Zubin Mehta seems to elicit less inspired orchestral playing than in the other 3 operas. This impression may be partly due to the more distant and less well balanced recording quality.The filming quality is again excellent. In summary, this DVD is worth watching but the ultimate experience is less satisfying than I found with the other 3 parts of this Ring cycle.
