STORY: Family moves out of the big city to be in an area &quot;safer&quot; for the kids. But when the previous owner of the home they just bought gets out of jail, they discover the country can be more dangerous than the city.MY FEEDBACK:1) It is always a pleasure watching Quaid and Stone. They are quality actors who have a charisma about themselves.2) The movie takes what seems an eternity to get going. Once it does get going it seems like it is over way too quick.3) The suspense scenes were telegraphed way in advance so they weren't suspensful after all.4) Plot holes galore. Too many unanswered questions. A lot of potential that just went to waste.5) The ending was dumb! The very last shot seemed to be the director's effort to leave you guessing if things are really resolved or not but it was so haphazzardly done that it felt out of place vs. a natural progression of the story.OVERALL: If it was any actors other than big names ones like Quaid and Stone, this movie would have recieved a 1 star. Not worth renting unfortunately.
