We bought 12 of these and none worked.  They didn't even pump up the wrist strap to measure blood pressure.This is Chinese junk - do not buy at any price.Since we didn't get around to testing them until after the return period had expired, Amazon would not take them back.We scrapped all twelve.Dave Dougherty
