It is always on my Epicurean Cutting Surfaces 18-by-13-Inch Kitchen Cutting Board, Natural.  The ruler is painted on and lasted until the first scrubbing.  It's totally gone after one washing.  It would have been better if it the ruler was engraved.  The edge isn't too sharp but a couple of passes in my Chef's Choice® Commercial Model 2000 Diamond Hone® Knife Sharpener fixed that.This is a well-built and functional product that every chef should have.
