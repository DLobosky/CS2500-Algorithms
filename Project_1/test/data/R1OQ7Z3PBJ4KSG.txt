I was a big fan of the TV series a few years back, and seeing this game in all its HD goodness really brought back memories.  NUNS uses a type of cel-shading that, for all intents and purposes, looks amazing in comparison to other games I've seen and even exceeds the art/animation quality of the anime.  Colors, line detail, and shadowing all look fantastic for the characters.  I was especially impressed at the fluidity of battles and fighting motions that seem to have been captured and digitally recreated to perfection.  In contrast, the backgrounds are a bit dull, but even in the manga/anime, they were never that big of a factor in terms of art.  Aside from that, this is easily the best looking Naruto game to date, thus far.Audio - 4.5NUNS offers a Dolby Digital 5.1 track in both Japanese and English.  For a video game, I thought it was adequate considering that most titles these days are just now starting to delve further into higher quality audio.  Directionality is fairly good, balancing music, sound effects, and dialogue mostly through the front sound stage, but also through the rears on occasion.  Voices and sound effects are taken straight from the anime, providing a familiar experience to fans of whichever language they prefer.  I believe I heard that the music was also composed by Toshio Masuda (the composer of the series' score), or at least someone from his staff, so that's another plus.  The only problem is the Ultimate Jutsu glitch, where on occasion you'll hear this explosion sound loop in itself at the end of a battle.Gameplay - 4.0NUNS makes for a visual treat in terms of commercial fighting games.  If you or your friends are fans of the franchise, you'll probably enjoy hours of fun fighting against each other with most of your favorite characters.  However, the story mode leaves much to be desired.  Basically, you run around Konoha performing ninja missions, most of them coming in the form of mini games, and then the occasional battle and even monster battles (which graphically speaking are the prettiest parts of the game).  Story mode itself is fun at first.  But with little diversity and no cut scenes whatsoever to advance the plot, one can only hope that, with their foot now in the door, Namco will improve on this flaw in future installments.The battle system itself isn't really a "fighting game" in the sense of the usual suspects (Street Fighter, Soul Caliber, Tekken, etc.), but more so a button masher.  Players can essentially have 4 items to use in-battle, one jutsu, one ultimate jutsu, and 1-2 support characters that can either combo or jutsu as backup.  Don't let the button mashing be too big a concern, however.  There are actually enough tactics you could use to make it a little more challenging when fighting someone who actually knows how to play.  Unfortunately, most of my friends don't...  But overall, it's still fun to play with friends, if not for the experience, then at least for the eye candy.Packaging - 5.0NUNS Limited Edition comes in a spiffy steelbook casing and includes the game, the soundtrack, and a limited edition Naruto laser cel.  There is also a plastic slipcover with the PS3 and NUNS logos printed on the front and a small picture of Itachi on the bottom of the spine that goes over the case.  The case itself has a picture of Kyuubi (Nine-tails) Naruto on the front and Cursed Seal Sasuke on the back.  If your friends have tendency of not washing their hands, be prepared to wipe a lot of fingerprint smudges off the case after they leave.Overall - 4.0If you're a fan of the franchise and can spare the money, it's worth looking into, but only if you plan on having friends over on a regular basis.  The visuals and audio are top-notch, but aside from the battles, the story mode just isn't enough as it becomes more and more stale after a while.  Recommended for fans, a rental at best for the casual gamer.
