Saw this on dvd the other night and couldn't really believe it.  Here are ten (10) - Count 'em - ten quick and easy obeservations:1.  It's easy to watch "Saint Elmo's Fire" from beginning to end, but that's not because it's a great or even a very good story.  It's not.  It's a watchable film due to some other elements that were probably unintentionally included.2.  For those of us who remember the early years of Reaganomics and the recession of the early eighties (Which could easily have gone into a depression), this film brings back memories of how bad things really were at the time.Whether it purports to be or not, "Saint Elmo's Fire" is, in large part, about life under the Reagan administration.  It's too bad that Oliver North didn't put in a cameo, but I guess he was probably busy getting weapons to the Contras at that time.3.  I'm not going to summarize something you can see for yourself, but I will say that this film is about a group of seven self-absorbed, terminally cute, whiny  preppies following their graduation from Georgetown University.  Although Rob Lowe deserves every accolade he got for his portrayal of a walking pile of human waste, Demi Moore's character is especially despicable and hateful.4. At the middle of the film, I kept wishing for something dramatic to happen... Like the group goes out in a car and they drive head on into a brick wall at ninety miles an hour.After about an hour of viewing, it's hard to care what happens to any of the characters, because the plot is so contrived. None of the characters portrayed in the film remotely resemble human beings, at least in the way they react to given situations. Each seems about as two dimensional as the life-size cardboard silouhettes of movie stars you'll see in the lobbies of theatres from time to time.  The way the characters react to the world around them doesn't seem real or even remotely possible.To his credit, Emilio Estevez actually does crank out a good performance, but his pursuit of the Andie McDowell character is not just embarassing, it's also borderline behavior.All of the above aside, here's why you should get a copy of "Saint Elmo's Fire" and watch it from beginning to end:5.  First of all, ignore the characters, ignore the story, and just cue in on the visuals.It's hard to believe that the eighties really produced such excesses in bad taste, but it's all here on film.  Just check out the Lofts and some of the clothing and hairstyles, to say nothing about the attitudes.6.  All that this movie is not is much greater than what it actually is."Saint Elmo's Fire" is a film that precluded "Seinfeld" by just a few years.  Check it out!  Like Seinfeld, it has self-absorbed characters you really wouldn't want to know personally, and it's a show about nothing.7.  If you watch "Saint Elmo's Fire" with friends, you can actually turn the sound off and make up your own dialogue for the characters as you go along.One of the most confusing aspects of "Saint Elmo's Fire" is that there is no clever dialogue, and no jokes, visual or otherwise.  Not one real shed of humor in this film.The upside is that since there isn't any real storyline anyway, with a little imagination, you can have the characters saying things to each other that even R. Lee Ermy would feel weird about!8.  The David Foster Love Theme instrumental is repeated over and over, dozens of times.  Just when you think it's going to stop, it starts up again. Isn't that wonderful?9. Two words, Baby: Chick Flick!10.  Would I recommend this film to my friends? Sure!  Anything's better than watching "The English Patient".Bonus Comment:  I predict that by the year 2025, this film will be a tremendously popular camp favorite with people who are yet to be born, or are in their early infancy.By 2025, Ally, Judd, Demi, Emilio and the gang will be enroute to the old actor's home.  By then, kids will look at "Saint Elmo's Fire" in much the same way that most kids of today watch movies like "The Trip", or "Hell's Angel's `69" and think that their parents used to be Martians.
