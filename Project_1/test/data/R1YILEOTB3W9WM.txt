They introduced me to Kundalini Yoga and this is now the type of yoga I do most often.That being said, this DVD is not one of my favorites.  I appreciate that they add creative twists to Kundalini yoga, but this one is not one of their better efforts.What I liked about this DVD:--the different music.  It's still new-agey, but with a faster beat. --Ana is radiant and glowing, as always.  She is a joy to watch.--Both Ravi and Ana give instruction.  I love hearing both their voices.--the new moves.  In spite of making over 20 Kundalini yoga DVDs, Ravi and Ana manage to come up with new moves.--how I feel after doing this DVD.  Like with their other DVDs, I feel calm, yet energized and happy.What missed the mark with this DVD:--the odd choice of scenery.  The workout is filmed against a backdrop picture from Hawaii (or maybe California).  It looks totally fake.  The lotus blossom and Buddha sitting in the left corner look out of place.--the cardio section did not flow well at all.  This portion was very choppy.  Perhaps if Ravi had given some more explanation as to the purpose of each move, the moves would have made more sense to me.--having to do the cardio section with shoes.  Excuse me, but yoga with shoes?  It breaks up the workout to have to stop the DVD, put on shoes and then come back to do a sloppily edited cardio section.--the matrix doesn't work.  You can select maybe 3 sections and then the selector freezes.  I don't bother with the matrix anymore. --Odd and inconsistent camera angles.  It's nice to see the poses from  different angles, but several poses must have been filmed at different times.  One part of a move shows Ana sitting lengthwise on the mat, the camera then switches to Ana sitting cross-wise on the mat continuing the move.  This may have been because of the re-editing they had to do, but if this wasn't the case, this is very distracting and to me shows sloppy editing.  Yes, the poses flow, but it's distracting.--Stops and starts when switching scenes.  There are a few places where the DVD seems to stop and then quickly start again.  It's the editing and not the DVD. Again, this may have been because of some re-editing they had to do.This DVD has a place in my collection, but I would recommend any of their older DVDs instead of this one.
