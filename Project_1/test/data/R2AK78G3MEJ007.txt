Secondly, I wanted to have a flash MP3 player for working out.The player itself is small, with a high quality glossy 320x240 screen.  It is about the size of a credit card.  Note the screen is very sensitive to fingerprints and is NOT a touch sensitive screen.  Instead, you control the Zen through a four-way controller, play/pause button, menu button, back button.  To me, this is more effective since some touch screens can be hard to use.  This player has an impressive list of features. It supports the standard features---playlists, playing back by artist/album/genre, shuffle and repeat playback, MP3 playback.  Beyond that, it has an SHDC slot onto which you can load more music and videos (if 16 GB isn't enough space for you), can record voices, synchronizes contacts/tasks/appointments with Outlook (a much handier feature than you'd think since it gives you a small phone book), and can receive FM radio (helpful in gyms where TVs often send audio to a particular FM station).  In terms of what music formats does this support, it supports most common formats---WAV, MP3, AAC (iTunes Plus format music), WMA (but not lossless).  Unfortunately, the player does not support Ogg Vorbis files (royalty-free MP3 workalike).As for videos, Creative provides software to convert almost any video to work on the Zen.  Windows Media Player can also convert videos to work on the player.  Personally, I'd only watch TV shows (or shorter) since the screen is so small.  Using Windows Media Player, synchronizing the Zen is simple.  Windows Media Player 10 will see the Zen and allow you to synchronize playlists, copy songs to the player, and the likes.  With all of these features, what are the downsides?First of all, songs and video stored on the SHDC card are not included in the list of items on the player.  Instead, you need to browse the memory card and play each one individually.  The player can copy all data from the SHDC card to its internal memory, but if your player is full, this won't help.  I use the SDHC card mainly to store videos.Secondly, editing playlists in the player is extremely awkward.  You can create playlists and add songs to them easily.  However, you cannot sort a playlist by album/artist/genre---it becomes a flat set of songs.  This means you cannot remove, say, an album from the playlist, without removing each song, one by one.Also, the Zen sometimes locks up.  I found that most common when I tried to edit playlists using Gnomad 2 on Linux, when the playlists contained WAV files.If you are using a Mac this player may not work for you, since it does not appear as a USB drive.  You can use the "Gnomad 2" software on Linux to work with the Zen, but I'm not aware of any Mac software to communicate with the Zen.Since the Zen is not from Apple, it does not have an iPod interface, so it cannot use most of the tons of iPod specific accessories, but that is true of all non-iPod players.Basically, if you have a large library of WMA files (the default when you rip music from Windows Media Player) and don't lust after the look of the iPod (it is a very stylish player), the Zen is a far better choice than the iPod.  Converting WMA files to MP3 hurts the quality of the music---I don't advise it.If you want a solid media player, and want more storage for your money ($150 gets you an 8 GB iPod Nano), the Zen is a better choice than the iPod.However, if you are on a Mac, or use iTunes as your main media player, the iPod is a better choice, since the iPod/iTunes integration is so smooth.
