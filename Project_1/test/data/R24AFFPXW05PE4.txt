I am coming to the realization that the reason why I have these two consoles is not just because I wanted the exclusively licensed game content for each (such as Zelda on the Wii or Halo on the Xbox), but it's becoming more and more apparent to me that the Xbox is my single-player console, and the Wii is my multiplayer console.  I tend to play immersive first-person single player games that take advantage of the HD graphics and audio power of the Xbox 360, while the Wii is generally used to play multiplayer games, especially when we have friends over.This game will not disappoint on that front.  The action is frantic and hilarious.  The microgames consist of dozens (Nintendo claims around 200 in total) of different tasks centered around a number of "forms" or starting positions.  For instance, the first form you will encounter is the Remote Control, and you hold the Wiimote just like you're holding the TV's remote control.  From this position you might be tasked with accomplishing anything from tossing some stir-fry in a saute pan to flipping pancakes, or shooting cans or even bouncing a tennis ball on a racquet.  There are forms like "The Handlebars" where you hold the Wiimote crosswise with both hands, or "The Diner" where you hook up the nunchuk attachment and hold the two controllers like a fork and knife.Pretty much every microgame is timed to last just a few seconds so you have to think - and act! - quickly.  The more you play, the better you'll recognize the challenges, but that doesn't mean they're easy!  Each type of microgame generally has at least three levels of difficulty, and in addition to getting harder you'll typically find that either you have less time as you get farther into a series of challenges.The single-player game is really just about introducing the various forms and unlocking different activities, culminating in unlocking the multiplayer games.  You should be able to complete the single-player portion in an hour or two to unlock multiplayer mode.Multiplayer mode offers additional games (two to start, and playing through each one unlocks another game, which unlocks another, for a total of 7 or 8 multiplayer styles that accommodate anywhere from 2-12 players, depending on the game.  This is where what I see as the first real shortcoming of Smooth Moves comes in... you can only use one Wiimote at a time.  It seems pointless to force player to pass the Wiimote back and forth (especially since the action is usually happening fairly quickly, and Nintendo insists that you must wear the wrist safety strap, which can make it sometimes difficult to get ready in time for your turn).  Allowing the use of up to 4 Wiimotes would be much preferable.If you are not into the multiplayer experience, then you will definitely want to pass on this game.  It's a fun game to run through, but after a few hours you would be bored out of your mind.  This is primarily a party-oriented game for 2-4 players (though as I said, some games allow for up to as many as 12 players taking turns).  It's kind of like the popular card game Uno.. not so much fun for two people, and much better with four - the more people you get playing the more fun it is for everyone.  A lot of the games cause you to do crazy things that everyone will be laughing about so it's not a lot of just sitting around, waiting for your turn.
