I originally reviewed this player a week ago and gave it a neutral review. I have deleted that review and now give it a negative review because it has become incompatible with my Samsung TV. Other faults include a very slow start up - by that I mean from the time you turn it on until it is ready to function, an idiotic system which from a heading on the initial screen scrolls both up and down and finally an instruction book and web site which are useless.On the other hand, the Sony technical support is exceptionally good. The Blu Ray picture is ok, not as good in my opinion as a year older LG BD370 and the upconversion of conventional DVDs is excellent. This player has a myriad of sites which one can go to, set up to the internet with the built in WIFI was easy, although  the wireless receiver has a limited range - in my house it would not work 50 feet from the wireless router. The player promises it will be 3-D upgradable.I also do not like the way Netflix streamed movies are displayed, by that I mean the menu and the way one gets a description of them. My LG BD370 has a better display and easier menus.Today I spent approximately 1 hour with Sony Tech Support trying to fix the problems I was having. The person I spoke to had a very good knowledge base and was very helpful but after an hour, without resolution to the problem, I gave up, packed the set and returned it.As I have been very pleased with my LG BD370, I ordered a newer version the 570. I must add I did not initially want to purchase another LG as I found their tech support to be very poor and did not want to reward them; however after I read many of the reports of the Samsung players on the Amazon web site, the Samsung players seem to have more problems than the LG ones. Stay tuned as I will add a review after the LG arrives.In short I would avoid this Sony player
