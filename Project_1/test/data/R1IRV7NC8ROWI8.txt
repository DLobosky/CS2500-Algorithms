This could confuse your results as the top tab might be yellow or orange underneath.I do like how these are packaged, the bottle makes it easy to get the strips out, and the strips are bigger than the Phinex strips we compared against; however, the accuracy for us is what is more important, and we feel that these strips test more acidic than they should.
