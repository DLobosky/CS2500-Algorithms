Cars 2 is not that bad as it was projected when it was released. I had a sense from the reviews that the story isn't warm as the other movies of Pixar (re: Mater being put down by McQueen). However, this did not seem to be entirely true. This one has nicely written story, which values friendship indeed. Nevertheless, I cannot rate this as five stars as it lacks the identity of Pixar movies. Pixar has been known to be make extremely innovative, brilliant and highly entertaining animation flicks. Each time, Pixar just didn't make the movie, but actually created a whole new world and introduced an ultra-fresh concept and had been seldom repetitive. Take any flick from Monsters, Nemo, Cars, Incredibles to Wall E, every movie is as isolated as an island, yet remarkably brilliant and incredibly warm (humane). It's not an easy challenge to maintain. However, this is the exact thing gone missing in Cars 2. Without any innovation and depth, Cars 2 just remains a excellent animated movie, not a "Pixar" movie.It is impossible not to compare this with original CARS, as it will not be judged by anyone as a standalone Pixar animated movie. Hence, here it is..1. This one is more action-based than the first. The story resembles to a Bond movie, hence at times it appears as if the real actors are just given a 'car-face' to play. What I mean is, this movie isn't outstanding in terms of originality of animation, its more of a action movie plot played by animated characters.2. The first one has better story and quality animation. Don't take me wrong, cars 2 animation is top-notch, but it's just an extension of the first one. However, I must give a standing ovation to the Tokyo, Italy and London they have created!3. Cars 2 is waaay behind the original movie when it comes to real laughters. There is hardly any point where you will laugh aloud. Hence if you are considering this as a comedy option, just don't expect much.4. Most characters are pulled from the original movie, this one has only one prominent character (mcmissile by Michael Cain), I couldn't think of any other.All in all, Cars 2 is okay to see once, and it's perfectly fine to skip it if you love the original. It will not be too much to say that it's better to watch the first one twice than to spend a lot of money on this.
