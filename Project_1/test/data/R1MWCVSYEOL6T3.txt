There are a ton of elements in the film-making process that M Night seems to be extremely gifted in.  Camera-work, generating atmosphere, lighting, set design, he's outstanding with; maybe the best since Hitchcock (as some people have implied).  Unfortunately for 'Signs', concise story-telling dosen't seem to be one of them.There are a couple of real issues with the plot of this movie that needed to be addressed before this movie was released. For example, the ending was similar to 'War of the Worlds', but the hook dosen't make any sense.  Why would aliens with a certain weakness want to invade a planet covered by so much of it?  At one point a stat is given about Joaquin Phoenix's home run record.  Does anybody appreciate how far that home run would be?  It would be the longest in history.  I don't care how many times the guy struck out.  Barry Bonds strikes out all the time, he's still in the majors.It was little points like this that were just killing the experience for me ....
