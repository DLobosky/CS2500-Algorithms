It was with mixed feelings that I awaited the delivery of my Blu-Ray of Time Machine 2011: Live In Cleveland.  I had purchased the CD/MP3's from Napster the day it came out and was a bit underwhelmed.  Geddy's vocals were a bit lacking and I thought that age had begun to caught up with him.  I thought the CD was a fine momento for those who actually went to the show and little more.  I had seen this show at the end of the first leg, and I thought the performance in West Palm Beach was better than what I was listening to on my I-pod.I gave that CD three stars basically saying that those who wanted a souvenir of the tour, it was worth the cash, but on it's own merits, there was better live versions of most of the songs out there.  I still stand by that review.  Many others as well reviewed the CD similarly so I know I'm not alone in that thought.My Blu-Ray arrived a week later.  Ok, I thought, you know what it sounds like, but at least you'll like the visuals.  My expectations were definitely lowered.I was blown away.  Don't get me wrong, this is the exact same tracks that are on the CD's.  There are a few seconds of dialog missing from the CD and the CD is broken up between Limelight and Camera Eye, whereas the Blu-ray keeps the intermission intact.  I certainly can hear some of the same weaknesses that I heard on the CD.  Time Stand Still has some cringe inducing moments.  But for some reason, maybe it's the DTS surround mix, Maybe it's watching them play as well as listening to the content, but for whatever reason, Geddy's vocal weaknesses are not as apparant in the Blu-Ray as they are in the CD.  I am not an audiophile by any means, so I can't really critique the "mix" or any other aspects others here may be able to critique more effectively. As a Rush fan, I simply love this Blu-Ray.  I have both Rush in Rio and Snakes and Arrows Live on DVD.  Rush in Rio is a great concert video but the camera shots are too short and don't seem to linger on the band long enough and seem almost random in their cut aways.  Snakes and Arrows Live is a much better show.  It's looks and sounds much better, though the crowd in Holland can't compare to 40,000 brazillians, however the Snakes and Arrows Setlist is not one of my favorites.  The Time Machine tour show is simply amazing.  The concert is filmed brilliantly and the shots are logically situated, focusing on a band member at the appropriate time.  Whether it's Neil doing a fill-in, Alex doing a solo on the Mandolin, or Geddy performing a bridge on the synth, the camera tracks whatever band member is dominant at the time.Overall, his Blu-Ray provides a completely different experience than the CD.  I'll continue to listen to the CD as it is a portable version of this fine show.  But as far as an over all experience this Blu-Ray just blows the CD and most other Rush Concerts I've seen filmed out of the water.  So much so, that I barely notice that Geddy is not at his prime vocally.  Musically, the band here is in top form.If you went to this show then you'll want to pick up both the CD and the Blu-Ray/DVD as you'll want a portable version of this show to listen to in the concert, or while working out, or wherever you are.However if you only want to buy one version of this show, then this Blu-Ray is the only way to go.  It is amazing.  And finally, if you already purchased the CD and were somehow disappointed, then I suggest you buy the video.  It's hard to figure out but it's on a magnitude better than than the audio only version.  Someone tell me I'm wrong.  I just can't believe that I'm listening to the same performance.  And yet there it is, the Blu-Ray/DVD blows the CD out of the water and I have no idea why.A definite must have!!!!
