Why can't Warner Brothers just give you a download code for iTunes like every other studio?  UltraViolet is HORRIBLE. Stay away!  I may never buy another WB movie again. That said, Gree Lantern is a good if not great movie. I just feel like I was duped with this purchase because of the type of digital copy (UltraViolet).  I got doubly duped as I bought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 as well. Ugh!  I am literally at a loss for words. I recommend buying from iTunes if you,want a digital copy.
