Aftermath shows a tremendous leap for the band. Mick Jagger &amp; Keith Richards were starting to bloom as songwriters and the band started to step away from the heavy R&amp;B sounds of their earlier albums. Brian Jones was the founder and spiritual leader of the band and Aftermath contains some of his finest moments with the band. &quot;Paint It Black&quot; was the band's third number one single and it sounded like nothing they had done previously with it's sitar work and eerie, apocalyptic sound and doomsday lyrics. &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; has the lowdown, dirty vibe that would permeate alot of their future records. &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; is one of the all-time best Stones songs and the samba beats and controlling lyrics. &quot;Lady Jane&quot; sounds stately with the harpsichord, &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot; moves along smoothly and the &quot;Going Home&quot; closes the album on a strong note.
