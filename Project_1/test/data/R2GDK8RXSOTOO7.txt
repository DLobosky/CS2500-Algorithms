The pace certainly quickens. Evan Margolin and Moira Denike return in SalsaCrazy presents Learn To Dance Salsa Beginners Volume 2, picking up basic dance lessons right where they left off in the first DVD. Dancers wise enough to tackle the Beginners Salsa Dance DVD 1 before starting this one will have an edge on those who jumped to this DVD. Even still, those who skipped to the beginners DVD 2 and have had some experience with Salsa dancing will catch on fairly easily. In this DVD, you will learn a variety of turns-the inside turn, turns with neck rolls, belly roll turns, etc.-and other moves like the hammerlock. Don't let the terminology scare you. Each step is broken down for you with close-up shots inset on the screen to really help you study the move. Through reviewing the entire series, I've learned that those are key aspects present in all of the Beginners DVDs of the SalsaCrazy Learn to Dance Salsa series.This DVD also gives a great deal of attention to making the perfect turn when completing patterns. From where the leaders' thumbs and palms should be to how followers should keep their hands and elbows so turns are smooth, seemingly effortless motions, Evan and Moira make sure you know exactly what to do. After that, it's on to learning patterns and variations on those patterns. By the end of the DVD you'll know enough moves to keep things interesting throughout an entire song...and through the entire night if they have enough endurance to manage. (No worries, I'm told it takes time to build up to be a Salsa pro that can stay out on the dance floor all night without getting too winded.)Typically, I'm not a fan of instructional DVDs but this and the other SalsaCrazy Learn to Dance Salsa DVDs have proven to be light-years beyond others on the market. I would, without hesitation, recommend the DVDs to anyone looking to learn to Salsa dance.
