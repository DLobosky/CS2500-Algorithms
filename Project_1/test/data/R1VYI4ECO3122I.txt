It sits on a shelf, still in it's original packaging, UNOPENED.  It's part of my collection.  I get a lot of pleasure from just looking at it.    It's not really meant to be played with, or even handled too much If you know an adult fan who or serious collector of Star Wars memorabilia or of Bobbleheads, this is a great gift.  If they're not that into it, I would get them something else.    It's not a toy for children.  The only thing that moves is the head.  The head is held on by a spring.  I would think that if a young child plays with it, it would soon be broken. The child would probably be unhappy with it because of the limited movement.  There are MANY good Darth Vader toys available through Amazon, and they fit a wide range of different ages.This is a wonderful thing for the right person, but for many people, it's not a good match.
