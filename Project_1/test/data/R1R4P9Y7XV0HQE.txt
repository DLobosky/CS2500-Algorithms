I am very pleased with them. They are about 2 1/4 inches tall. I find them to be a nice fit with the Melissa and Doug folding dollhouse. I like their size with the furniture that comes with that house actually better than I like the size of the two dolls that come with the house. So I am making these the ones I use in it.
