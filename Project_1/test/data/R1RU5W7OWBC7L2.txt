Shout! Factory's first Gamera DVD release (overlooking their Elvira's Movie Macabre edition of Gamera, Super Monster) finally gives the monster the respect he deserves. The video and audio quality are fantastic. Extras include a booklet, original Japanese trailer (with subtitles), a Gamera series retrospective featurette (with not 100% accurate subtitles, but subbed nonetheless), publicity image gallery, and an informative audio commentary by kaiju authority August Ragone. The DVD lacks the original US version Gammera the Invincible, or the Sandy Frank-released dub from the 80s. Despite these shortcomings, this DVD should belong in every kaiju fan's collection.
