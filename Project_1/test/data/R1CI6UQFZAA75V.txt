So I gave good stars.Took a star away for misleading "generic" picture AND supposed to be 'custom' fit.When trimmed down to size, it is a pretty close match for the small OEM carpet mats.As the other reviewer noted, they don't quite have the same width and coverage as the OEM carpet.The Drivers side is not wide enough really, I would have liked them to extend more to the door sill.Drivers side also does not 'quite' match the left side foot rest shelf.Not a true 'custom fit', but close.
