This thought-provoking new work by prolific Harvard professor Edward O. Wilson, an outspoken and acclaimed Harvard naturalist who founded the field of sociobiology, is in effect a paean to the hopes for recovering some sense of balance and perspective between the natural world and the political, economic, and social forces now posed against it. There is much passion as well as polished prose herein, and Wilson employs his fabled ability to tell a story well to spin his thoughts and perspectives into a convincing and often compelling argument for a much more rational and intelligent approach to the issue of reconciling the goals of the so-called civilized world with the needs for radical change in how we affect the natural environment.  Wilson wisely poses the issue in terms any intelligent reader can understand; showing us how dangerously close we are coming to fatally wounding the natural world, and what we must now proceed to do if this natural world is to be saved from the unwieldy hands of mankind. He employs a fanciful imagined conversation with Thoreau in the woods near Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts, and draws out of this dialogue a perspective lovingly laced with both an appreciation for the sanctity of the natural world and our own seeming inability to recognize how badly we have interfered with its vital processes and qualities. In an argument at once both intellectual and emotional, Wilson counterpoises his concerns with aspects of the ecosystem with similar concerns about how to manage and encourage human social and economic activities less antagonistic and more beneficial to the natural environment. He argues quite persuasively that the most meaningful and momentous debates of the new millennium will be to attempt to allow human economic, material and social progress while minimizing the deleterious effects of such efforts on the natural world. He also allows that issues regarding relative equity of material distribution make it difficult for western economists and politicians to suggest the rest of the world disengage from their enthusiastic quest for material plenty for themselves while we in the advanced industrial democracies of the west float in our well-cushioned laps of luxury.  Yet, the fact remains that as this economic drive for material wealth proceeds, we are losing the race for biological diversity and an integrated and healthy biosphere. Indeed, he argues, what he terms the `trajectory' of specific species loss is, when all else is said and done, a result of human choices and the human appetite for turning the biosphere in a material marketplace for human consumption.  Finally, then, we have to recognize that if we are to slow or even reverse the alarming pace of biosphere degradation, we must shift to a more long-term orientation, one in which we recognize the fundamental ways in which our own long-term well being, health, and prosperity depend on our ability to walk more softly on the earth. As he says, we must come to see that conservation and active concern for the natural world is absolutely vital if we and the world itself are to long endure. Yet for all this, he ends the book on a positive note, sharing the idea that any civilization capable of envisioning God, embarking on the colonization of space, must surely have the intellectual and spiritual capital required to safeguard the natural world and the panoply of life it holds in its borders. Enjoy!
