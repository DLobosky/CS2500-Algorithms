I used to have this on DVD and I only watched it once. Perhaps this is because the film is quite boring and even the presence of the beautiful Famke Janssen cannot balance the trash out.Every set looks the same as the last and it's just so dull. It should have been gorier and milked it's hardly original concept for all it's worth. The dialogue simply stinks too. Jerry Goldsmith's music is below par also which is very strange for him as he usually produces the best stuff.Sommers went on to direct The Mummy and The Mummy Returns and from these 3 films it's easy to guess how his typical standard will be. Skip it.The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and non-anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen.
