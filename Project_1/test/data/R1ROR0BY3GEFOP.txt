He plays a dual role here as the mummy ImHoTep/the modern Ardath Bey. He seeks his lost love, the woman he died for thousands of years ago, and finds the lovely Helen played by Zita Johann. Classic material, lovely shots of Egypt, and a great film overall.The collection also includes "The Mummy's Hand". While not as good as the original, it is spooky. But it also lacks the chemistry and a good strong cast and it is more of a comedy than a horror film. The original story is changed, and this one is a lemon in my opinion.These are all "Sons of" movies, featuring Mummys. Lon Chaney Jr stars in "The Mummy's Toumb" and to be honest, the script is lacking and this is not a good vehicle for Lon Chaney Jr's excellent talents. The story is changed, we no longer have ImHoTep and Ardath Bey, but now have a different story with the mummy being Karis.He reprises his role in "The Mummy's Curse" and again, he is good, but the script fails him. We move from Egypt to - "Cajun Country" Huh?And finally, we see "The Mummy's Ghost" again with Lon Chaney Jr. as Karis and featuring John Carradine as the mummy. Again, the story spins, but we are treated to a couple of great actors in a film that was not totally bad, but not anywhere near the original.The films keep to the "lost love" theme, but never make it as good as the original.Quality wise, these films are cleaned up, the sound is very good and overall the appearance of these films is remarkable. There are also extras, like the making of the film, theatrical trailers, stills, and film history. This is a two disk set with a double sided DVD.These "collections" do contain some films that you will not find anywhere else, and if you are a big fan of the old Universal horror films, especially The Mummy, and cameos by classic actors, this collection will fill the bill. This one was a bit better in that it did have one classic movie and one "Son of" that wasn't so bad.
