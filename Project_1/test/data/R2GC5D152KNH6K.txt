One of the things I really loved about this story was the unique storyline. The story developed well and I found the characters to be quite likeable and developed nicely for the length of the story. Being that I am an avid erotica reader it wasn't quite as steamy as I would have liked, but aside from that I really enjoyed the story and look forward to reading more from this author.
