Reading this book provides a fairly compact history of Cisco Systems' ascent from a start-up to temporarily being the world's most valuable corporation in less than 20 years. As best I can tell from comparing the book to interviews with Cisco executives and news reports, the data included are pretty accurate.The only significant things missing from this book is enough context on why Cisco has been more successful than other companies, and while it may become less successful in the future. The details are there, but the highlighting of what is significant is too general and light. The essential point is that a company needs a vision, strategy, values, culture, management style, and business processes that permit it to prosper from irresistible forces and trends, regardless of how these turn out. Cisco has adhered to this perspective more than almost any other company involved with the Internet.The aspects of what Cisco does differently come primarily in using acquisitions to add talent and provide flexibility responses to unclear, emerging technology trends. The accomplishment here is that the talented people stay, are more productive than ever before, and fit comfortably into the Cisco culture. Hardly anyone ever does these things well.  Cisco's big advantage is that it can quickly take these technologies and expand their distribution.The authors also understate the significance of how Cisco has multiplied irresistible forces. The focus on the Internet allows the company to benefit from both Moore's and Metcalfe's Laws. Because of that, Cisco has enjoyed a very high stock price (although recently it has dropped to being only a mere high stock price). That makes for low costs in acquiring and keeping top people, through the use of stock-based acquisitions and stock options. Converging technologies mean that the Internet basis allows the company to impinge on other forms of communications as the convergence occurs. All this means that Cisco has the potential to be 10 times the size of Microsoft. The key difference: Cisco is much more adept at irresistible force management in the newer technology areas.People who want to understand more about high tech competition, how to create a successful company, and find good investments will all find this book to be valuable. I especially recommend this book to people who are about to start up a new business. Do take the material with a little grain of salt though. As good as Cisco Systems is, they're not quite as good as this book suggests.  But without the magical stock price growth, will Cisco be as successful?  Probably not.  Could overconfidence be part of the problem?  The recent slip in the company's expected rate of growth shows that the company is merely mortal after all.    Also, if you are looking for a great investment, I think you will find greener pastures in mass storage where the irresistible forces are even stronger.Never mistake temporary alignment with powerful irresistible forces for intelligence.
