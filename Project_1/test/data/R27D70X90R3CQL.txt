"Sweet Deception" is an INTRIGUING concept...I was totally CAUGHT UP in the budding romance of Joan and Ronald...Mrs. Sargeant weaves an ENGAGING tale...with a cast of well-developed and UNFORGETTABLE characters...the conflict and drama that the characters, (main and secondary) struggles with make this novel that much more compelling and entertaining...she creates quite a CAPTIVATING grown & sexy romance about personal and professional growth, love and life, and the UNFORTUNATE dysfunctional dynamics that some families experience...the whole church, family and erotic romance writing situation will quite possibly make for some interesting discussions among book club members.
