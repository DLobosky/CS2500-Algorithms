The deal is that he is to be partnered up with Dox as well as two other professionals whom he doesn't know, doesn't trust and basically doesn't really need.  So, why is it necessary for them to be part of "The Detachment"?Rain and his team are being tasked to take out several targets of political appointees who are conspiring to throw the United States into turmoil through the guise of terrorist attacks and then use this disruption to basically instigate a Coup to take over the control of the United States.  Colonel Horton wants "The Detachment" to dispose of certain individuals to disrupt the coup.  Rain and his team are efficient in the work that they do.  But they are also very smart individuals and they start to question what is really happening.Through a very strange set of circumstances the team becomes the number one enemy of the State and are being hunted.  They are viewed as the problem and that they must be eliminated.  The team is in turmoil and the unity which was never there is surfacing.  There are trust issues.  When you have a group of assassins with trust issues you have a volatile situation.  When John Rain be able to handle the team, do the job, complete all the task and in the midst of this figure out the truth of what is really going on?  That is the gist of the book.   I found the writing so/so.  I didn't think that Eisler did a good job of developing the characters and the situation well.  That could be because this is another in the John Rain series.  Maybe he feels that everyone knows the characters and he doesn't need to do much development.  I don't know, but I felt it was weak.Also the 'hits' that the team does are not very suspenseful.  They are simple, to simple.  There should be some more complexity to them.  That made for a bit of boring reading for the first half of the book.  The story then starts to pick up as the team realizes that they are being hunted.  But again, there is a lot of dull action instead of the intense suspense action that most thrillers give.My bottom line.  If you like John Rain you are going to enjoy this novel.  You will not be disappointed.  If you are new to John Rain, then maybe go to the first couple of books in the series and read those first and then come back to this one.  I think you will enjoy it more if you do that.  I know I would have.  I now have to go and read the first books in the series.So, yeah, I give it a not so stellar rating, but I enjoyed it enough that I went and bought the first two in the series and will be reading those this next week.  So, if it caught me enough to buy others then maybe after I finish those I will return and upgrade my rating.  We will wait and see.As always, Enjoy Reading!
