The song , Redbone Hound", which leads off her one-and-only (why only one?) album, will have you hooked (it did me) from the get-go! You'll be riding along and find yourself singing "Ahooooo!", just like she does on the chorus. But this is just the beginning. Every one of the songs - all self-composed - is a winner, in both lyrical content and instrumentation. She had help of such Austin marvels as guitarist Redd Volkaert and the production quality is superb.The album was released in 2006 but seems to have flown under the radar. NPR chose "Good Enough" for the "Song of the Day" but if you didn't have your radio on, you would have missed it. Otherwise, it seems that Vaughn is Austin's best kept secret. Do yourself a favor, if you found this review by chance, get this album. You'll be playing it a lot!  Hopefully, Vaughn will get back in the studio and record a follow-up as good as this one. Three years is too long to wait!Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
