It is accurate, easy to use, and will save you a TON of money because you won't have to blindly follow the advice of your neighborhood pool store.  Highly recommended!!Background:  We just had built a new backyard pool this summer.  Initially, I took water samples every week to two (sometimes three) different pool stores that sell chemicals and equipment to pool owners.  I quickly learned that water testing is half-art and half-science.  I also learned that NOBODY will be as careful to perform water tests on your pool water than YOU.  Finally, I learned that there is so much variation in testing methods -- leading to differing, often conflicting advice from the pool pro at the pool store -- that the best course of action is to just do everything yourself.  It's easy to do, and it'll save you money, too.More background info:  I mentioned above that I had my water tested by two (or three) pool companies.  Using water samples taken at the same time and place in my pool, and having the water tested within the hour, these pool companies would give sometimes widely varying test results -- leading to sometimes conflicting advice.  Example:  Pool Co #1 said my free chlorine was 4 ppm, while Pool Co. #2 said my free chlorine was either near zero or super high, like around 10 ppm.  Example #2:  Pool Co. #1 said my Total Alkalinity was way too high; add acid!  Pool Co. #2 said my alkalinity was a little low; add baking soda!  Whom do I believe?  This is why I test my own water now -- I *very carefully* measure everything, including the amount of water being tested, and the drops of the chemicals I add to the water.  I'm not in a rush; I want accurate test results.  What I LIKE:- It's easy to learn how to test your pool water for all the essential things:  Free Chlorine, Combined Chlorine, pH, Total Alkalinity, Calcium Hardness and Cyanuric Acid (stablizer).  Only the cyanuric acid test is a little tricky, but you can easily repeat that test over and over without using more test chemicals (more on that later).- There is a very helpful pamphlet included in this kit that explains a lot about water testing and sanitizing.  It's pretty easy to read, too.- Using this kit lets you very precisely determine chlorine levels, including both free and combined chlorine, without having to do any color matching.  In fact, there is no color matching for any of the tests except the pH test.What Could Be BETTER:- I wish the kit came with a larger supply of the chemicals you use the most:  the powder and drops used with the chlorine test, and the red drops used for the pH test.  These are the tests you'll want to perform daily.  The other tests can be done between once a week and once a month.- The kit should point users to the Taylor website's videos which show how to perform the tests.Additional Advice:  Using this kit, I'm taking a minimalist attitude towards pool chemicals.  I don't shock the pool -- EVER -- unless combined chlorine is 1.0.  That saves money on chlorine.  I don't add clarifiers, phosphate removers, shocks, superchlorinators.  I keep my pool water around 3-4ppm with high levels of stablizer so the chlorine doesn't get burned up in the sun.  I do add algaecide once a week as a precaution against algae.  And I only add acid when pH rises to 7.8 or higher.I've already disregarded the advice of the "pros" who have suggested that I add this chemical or that chemical to my pool.  Using this Taylor kit, I am confident that I can continue keeping my pool water crystal clear and sparkling by spending 5 minutes a day doing chlorine and pH tests, and a few more minutes doing the other tests on Saturday morning.  If I followed the advice of the "pros", I would've dumped acid into my pool when I didn't need to, or I would have shocked my pool even though there was no reason to do so.  With knowledge comes power, and this Taylor kit gives me the knowledge I need to maintain my own pool water quality.Highly recommended!!!
