Before the Ove' Glove I always used a towel or pot holder to protect my hands when removing something hot from the oven. Invariable a finger would slip and get burned. This can't happen with the Ove' Glove or preferable a pair of Ove' Gloves attached to your hands.So far the Ove' Glove (s) have worked wonderfully for us. As long as you don't try to carry a hot pot around the house for a few minutes, your skin is safe when encased in the protective armor of an Ove' Glove. These gloves are worth every penny.
