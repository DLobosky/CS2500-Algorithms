When you have a knife like this, that's nice and heavy, it does all the work, and all you have to do it lower it.  I also love the "sure" grip handle. I've been cut on other knifes without this kind of handle like this one. This handle will not slip out of your hands, even when your hands are wet.  I l also love the shape of the knife. When I use it, my hands are protected from the blade.   It has an easy and natural cutting motion. I love to cook, and have had a lot of knives, but nothing comes close to this. I honestly can't say enough good things about this knife. If you  know someone that loves to cook, then this is a knife for them. Don't go for a cheap knife. After all, you get what you pay for.  You can't miss with this knife!  If you get it, I can promise you won't be sorry, I know I'm not.
