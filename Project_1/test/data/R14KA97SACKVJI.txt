I just learned how to make my own chocolates and these chocolate molds have blown me away. I am lactose intolerant and I also want my chocolates to be sweetened exclusively with xyitol. The mix goes in the molds and the little chocolates look like they have been made by a professional. So cute! Though I did not oil the molds the chocolates do not stick and come out very easily. The creases and the detail on the leaves are amazing. I am ordering more of these molds. Unlike the other reviewer I love the fact that they are not too deep. They are perfect for my chocolates!
