Dynamic transducers move more air than balanced armature transducers, and therefore tend to produce more bass. This is certainly the case with the HA-FX66s. I like them for listening to rock and for using when working out. At present (2/17/2010), Amazon is selling Altec Lansing BackBeat Pro IEM for the same price they are selling the HA-FX66s for (pennies under $20). The BackBeat Pros (which have a list price just under $100) use balanced armature transducers, have weaker bass than the HA-FX66s, but considerably more clarity and presence and a superior soundstage. I find them best for listening to Classical music.There is a company called Comply that makes foam IEM tips that fit the HA-FX66s (Comply T-400 Foam Tips, sold at Amazon as well as Radio Shack). They come in different sizes and some users may find that they are more comfortable and give a better seal in the ear canal and thus better sound than the tips that come with the HA-FX66s.The HA-FX66s are marketed as being comfortable due to the "air-filled soft body" of each monitor, and I find them to be the most comfortable micro-headphones I've used. And because they do not stick out of my ears at all, they are perfect for wearing in bed, because if I fall asleep with them on, there is no discomfort when I turn my head in such a way that my ear rubs against the pillow.Having said all that, if I were going to buy only one pair of IEM, given a choice between the JVC HA-FX66s and the Altec Lansing BackBeat Pros when both are selling for just under $20, I would choose the BackBeat Pros (they are really a steal for $20). I had to use tips other than those that come with them to get a good seal in my ear canals, but the fidelity is outstanding for the price, and to me is worth the sacrifice of bass. I'm glad I have both IEM and if someone who wants to spend no more than $20 on IEM is willing to sacrifice some fidelity, especially in mids and highs, for beefier bass, they should, IMO, go with the JVCs. (I've had no problem getting a good seal in my ears with the largest size tips the JVCs come with.)The JVCs come with a carrying case, but it's tiny, it looks and feels cheap, and I wouldn't use it for anything but as a place to store the extra tips. The bodies of the JVC IEM are aluminum rather than plastic and seem quite sturdy, and the slider on the Y-shaped cord is a nice extra touch.
