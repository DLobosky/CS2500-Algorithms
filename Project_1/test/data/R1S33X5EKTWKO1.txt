You've just graduated, and want to make your mark on the world.  What should you focus on?  Maria Shriver has excellent ideas for you!Most young people desperately want to carve their own niche and acquire competence in the 20s. In the course of doing that, they can fall into stalled thinking about living up to others' expectations and achieving perfection. This book provides a good antidote to those misconceptions. The advice encourages humility and realism. Because Maria Shriver is a celebrity who works in television, this message will seem relevant to even the most starstruck.The weakness of the book is that she only tells her own story, but doesn't use anyone else as an example.  We all can learn from everyone we meet, so Ms. Shriver does fall down in this one department.  Her memoir focuses on her life from the end of college to now. She comes across as well-meaning in this book, someone who's heart is in the right place and is willing to work like a dog. Even if you don't think you like her, take a look at the book. You can tell after a chapter or two if this is for you or not. Of her advice lists, I thought that 'pinpoint your passion' and 'be willing to fail' were the most pertinent to young people today who are just graduating. The reason these are important is that your passion will get you through the ups and downs in your chosen direction. Failures are your best learning experiences.Naturally, if someone you know wants a career in television, this book also contains some useful information about what the process is like. It's more hard work than many would imagine!Also, I suggest that you talk to some other older people to ask them what they have learned from experience.  Most people do not have a glittering or greatly satisfying life by middle age.  If they wanted better, where did they go wrong?  You can learn a lot from other peoples' mistakes, as well.  Persistence counts for a lot!
