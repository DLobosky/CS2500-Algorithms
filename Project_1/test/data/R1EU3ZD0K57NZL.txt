Not only this but also the sound of a classic church hymnal as background music sets the tone for a Christian religious movie.  The narration that follows, is by no means boring or soporific, as the music and voice and images presented are very engaging and intellectually stimulating.This documentary focuses solely on "The Life, Convictions and Martyrdom of" a man by the name Dietrich Bonhoeffer at the orders of no other than Adolf Hitler and his henchmen.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a pastor, theologian, university professor, anti-Nazi conspirator, and martyr who detected early on the evils of a new monster rising amidst his germanic countrymen (Adolf Hitler as Fuehrer, racism as means of national liberation, the deification of state authority, the corruption of the state churches) and amidst Christendom before the break of WWII in September 1939. His theology and actions also saved the lives of some Jews he personally helped escape to Switzerland.The presentation is rich in quotes from his writings, church sermons, and letters he wrote.  One gets the feeling of familiarity with his books ("Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Faith in Community," "Cost of Discipleship / Nachfolge," "Letters and Papers from Prison") after viewing this film.  Also quite a bit of time is spent explaining the geopolitical and social situation of Germany between the end of WWI and capitulation of German army in 1945 and during Dietrich's time abroad in Barcelona/Spain, American, and England.This Christian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, had a living theology and a theology that was alive.  And his life and writings are as relevant to our post-modern lives as they were to the turbulent 30s and murderous 40s.As a companion (especially for the un-churched or non-Christians) I would also recommend the 2003 First Run Features production of "Bonhoeffer - Pastor, Pacifist, Nazi Resister" also found on Amazon DVD.Because His "grace" is "costly!" (to use Bonhoeffer's terminology)
