I was incredibly surprised at the wisdom and insights into Godly parenting in this book. The author sets the stage for the entire book and its message by leading out with:"When parents are fleshing out their faith and living out their days with joy and honesty, their children will be attracted to it. Children want something that is real; they want to follow someone who is genuine."He encourages you through Truth in stating, "God is more concerned with your direction than He is your perfection."I loved how the message within the book was convicting, encouraging, and filled with powerful wisdom to guide you through the necessary elements of raising kids to love the Lord. This book is a MUST read for mothers and fathers, and even single parents. You will come to understand how important your role is in raising your children in the Lord, gaining understanding that you have a "high and holy" calling.I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this book! Its message is truly essential in Christian parenting.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneezeÂ®.com [...] book review bloggers program.
