I was torn on whether to give this book a 4star rating or 3. In the end, obviously i chose a 3 star rating.I read a tiny description of this somewhere and decided to read through the "free sample". I was captured from the beginning, but i kept feeling i was waiting for the story to begin, and it never really did.I got to chapter 14 thinking " wait, ive not learnt anything new!" It was the same thing being repeated over and over again.I really liked the idea of the faery world in an "urban " setting, ive never read anything in this genre before, so i wasn't really expecting anything.I was a bit disappointed with some story plots. They kept going on about "the game" but we never found out any in depth rules or what it was about, or who started it. You could kindof make it up in your mind, or get the gist from what they said, but you never really knew. SPOILER ALERT** I also would have preferred to have gone into a bit more detail about her mother and what connection she had with the faery king! There were so many things that never really got explored.The death of the Winter queen seemed rushed and i had to read back to actually read the bit where they killed her!? It seemed to me like a kindof "read between the lines" book.I read the book in about 4hrs, i was anxious to know how it ended and the next in the series seems interesting too. But after reading this one, and how the plot plodded on (in some parts), im not quite sure i want to read the next book all the way through.In all, i think it could have done with about 100 less pages and the story would seem more satisfying!Also, i know a lot of reviewers are saying that Seth is unbelievable as a character because he's too perfect. I have to disagree! I actually know a guy quite like him! There are men out there that don't fly off the handle and act with intense jealousy! He seemed like the calm kindof guy that just took things in his stride and thought about things before reacting.The only thing that i thought was a bit strange, was that there was not enough description of Aislinn, to tell me WHY he thought she was so amazing, amazing enough to fall in love with. Same with the Summer King...what was so special about her??? I found her bland.
