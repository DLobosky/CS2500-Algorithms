I enjoyed reading this one-volume survey of the events of the 20th century, whose stated editorial objective was to provide a literate and understandable survey of the panorama of change and tumult that so  characterized these last hundred years.  Given these very real limitations,  this essay-driven approach featuring a whole drawer full of celebrated  historians is a very satisfying and entertaining way for a reader to gain  an interesting, thematic, and absorbing overview of the events of our  century. This is a useful reference book that provides authoritative  historical sources describing the momentous events as well as significant  themes of the 20th century.  It is organized both by period and by  geographical areas, and commences with an excellent social, economic, and  political snapshot of the world as the new century dawns. By employing a  number of different essayists to describe various aspects of the unfolding  drama, it provides the reader with relatively concise overviews of salient  topics without having to muck about in the mind-boggling details some more  expansive histories would. In essence, the text neatly describes the major  events and phenomena of the century, discussing the various aspects of  each, and analyzing the particulars of both social disruptions via shifts  of power as well as the remaining elements of social cohesion and  continuity. As the reader soon discovers, however, the former far outweigh  the latter in the events and trends characterizing the times.  Indeed,  when one considers the radical departure between what existed throughout  the world at the onset of the century as opposed to what prevails at its  close, one is moved by the sense that the world had been literally  transformed over the hundred-year span. Where once proud and autocratic  kings, tyrants and potentates ruled with despotic indifference, now  indifferent democracies, uncertain dictatorships, and benignly ignorant  despots rule the stage.  We've moved from unreliable telegraphs to instant  wireless phones, from horse and buggy to space travel, and from death to an  early age to whole societies of seniors planning to live well into their  eighties and nineties. Where once people lived in splendid isolation from  the outside world in a sphere only painfully connected from one community  to another by mail, telegraph, and slow travel, we now have instant  awareness of all that happens around the globe. So, if some of us are not  entirely convinced of the progressive nature of this change, even we have  to admit that W. B. Yeats captured the kernel of the times by warning  things had "changed utterly".As I mentioned above, this book provides  the reader with a quite handy reference tool and a terrific overview, and  is organized both in terms of time periods, geographical area, and also  thematically around several key master processes that were instrumental  influences in the century. It is expressly not the sort of expansive,  detailed, and authoritative source for understanding or researching  particular events such as the Depression or the Cold War. For those kinds  of discussions one must turn elsewhere.   But for its intended purpose of  providing the serious student with an approachable, readable, and useful  guide to understanding the main currents and highlights (or perhaps low  points) of this explosive century, this is a wonderful book that belongs on  every 20th century history student's bookshelf. Enjoy!
