Everything I have ever read online says that budget priced cables are just as good as their incredibly expensive counterparts branded by Moster Cable and the like. So far this is the case with this cable. Does what I need to do, linking a DVD player/surround sound system to a plasma TV. The DVD player is compatible with ARC (Audio Return Channel) so the cable both can output audio/video to my TV or take audio from my TV when not watching a DVD. Worked like a charm. And I have about $20 more in my pocket by not buying an expensive brand name cable.
