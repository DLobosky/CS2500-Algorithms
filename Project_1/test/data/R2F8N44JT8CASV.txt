I've reviewed dozens of headphones from over-the-ear to in-ear, from $10 throw aways to $400 studio quality.These are pretty great little buds for the $13 I paid. Serious audiophiles need not bother, but if $40 is the top of your range you may want to check these out.I used a V-Moda Bass Freq, Klipsch Image S4, and stock iPod earbuds as my control groups. My caparison is on sound quality only. I'll describe construction later.So, let me compare to each:V-Moda: The GoGroove were a bit brighter. Mids seem more up-front, Highs seemed crisper, Lows were not nearly as present though. The V-Moda were very muddy by comparison.Klipsch: The GoGroove lacked in virtually every aspect. This is to be expected as the S4 are five times the price ($75). The S4 lows were lower and punchier, the highs crisper and the mids clearer.iPod: Of course, the GoGroove were much better in every aspect--what isn't?All-in-all the GoGroove buds are a great value.The lows lack a little and the highs are a little abnactious, but hey...$13.A few pionts I'd like to make are that the build quality of the cabinets seems very good (all aluminum), but the wires are flimsy and seem very prone to tangling and eventual shorting. This wire problem is a common theme with all the earbuds I tested.A side note about the GoGroove ear pieces--I have rather large ear canals and tend to use the largest option available on all the earbuds I purchase. I was unable to get a decent fit with these GoGroove earbuds as the largest size available was still on the small side. This of course led to less than optimal seal and a noticeable decrease in bass and noise isolation (Yes, I factored that in--they are still lacking in the low end).
