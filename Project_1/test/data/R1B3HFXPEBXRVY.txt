Since I am notoriously clumsy, almost predictably, my first few weeks with the NOOKcolor were alternately joyful, horrible, fascinating, and annoying.  The telephone tech support was woeful in February. They knew nothing. By April, they were better trained and were able to help me with a problem they didn't have a clue about 2 months before.The problem was that I read a lot of science and other nonfiction academic books and, naturally, take copious notes on them.  After reading a book, to my horror, I couldn't open it up to get at my comments.  In February, both phone and email techs tried all sorts of things to get my book to open and they failed. I wanted to know what I could have done to have this happen.  They said I didn't do anything.  In April, on the other hand, I tried again to open this book.  The tech support guy immediately walked me through reloading the book from the B&N website.  Then he asked me if I had made alot of highlights and notes on it. When I said, "Yes," he said that can sometimes corrupt the files.  You can comment and take notes, but not on almost every page. Anyways, I've had no problems like that since, and I can easily go to any book I've read and open it to the page which lists my highights and comments.Another problem I had was that suddenly pages would start to turn on their own, with me helplessly watching.  Tech support said it was because my screen was dirty.  They recommend using a dry microfiber cloth to clean it, but I found that didn't clean it enough, so I use my iPhone screen cleaner on the NOOKcolor and it's just fine.  No more unwanted page turns.As I said, there is a learning curve in managing the menus on such a sensitive screen.  But once you get the feel, accessing the right menu becomes almost automatic.I haven't yet downloaded my music, pictures or text files onto the device, but it's nice to know I can. Meanwhile, I find reading magazines on the NOOKcolor a delight.  National Geographic. Discover, and other such well illustrated periodicals are a joy and you see the value of the 6,000,000 colors the NOOKcolor can display.  If you read art books, or books on prehistoric civilizations, as I do, you will also appreciate the superb color reproduction.The screen is backlit, but I have no problem with glare even after reading up to 10 hours on it.  I also have no problem reading outside. I do have the anti-glare screen protector, however.I truly love this device.  It has no competition at the price.  I paid $249 at Barnes and Noble an bought a San Disk for a few dollars.  I'd say Amazon's price is way too high.I did have a Kindle and didn't like it at all, except for two things, and those two things I think NOOKcolor would benefit from.  One is Kindle's "go to__" command to go to a particular page. On the NOOKcolor, you either touch to bring up the slider and then slide until you get to the page.  The problem is that it's hard to get to a specific page.  The other way to do it is to touch to bring up Contents, and then go to the Chapter you think the page will be on.  The other thing Kindle does better is "Sync to farthest page read."  On the NOOK, if you go back 30 pages or so to reread something and then turn  the device off, when  you go back to the book, it will take you to where you left off, not the farthest page read.  So, you have to remember always to go to that point before you turn it off.Those are my only criticisms, and they're not enough to make me not love this e-reader.
