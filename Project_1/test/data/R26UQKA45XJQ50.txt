I've been using it since it came out (thanks amazon for having pre-orders!).I didn't want to get the previous version (I was hoping they would give us a keyboard with the number pad, but I finally gave in and grabbed this one).They say it will last about 9 months (battery life).  I hope it does and I can't wait to test that out fully (I will keep coming back to comment).My situation:I'm using this bluetooth keyboard with my macbook pro connected to my LCD tv.I'm sitting on my couch, with the keyboard on my lap (actually the keyboard box is on my lap, the keyboard sitting on top of it (slight elevation).I've used it since it came out and I have no regrets.  The keys have a nice touch to them (sort of a textured feel that just feels good on the fingers) and it's very easy to get your work done.I keep the box on my lap and keyboard on top of the box.This serves 2 functions:Slight elevation (better for the wrists) and when I'm done I can put the keyboard back inside the case (thus keeping dust to a minimum).Pros:Nicely designed keyboard with just the right amount of space between the keys (if you used the new thin keyboard from apple, you will fit right in, if you have used any of their laptops, the same applies).Pairing takes a few seconds (very easy), and couldn't be easier.  The keys have a nice textured feel to them, I love having the function keys and this keyboard really is all you need (it took me a while to see the light, don't let that happen to you, less really is more).9 month battery life (I can't attest to this right now, but I can say I've had no problems thus far)Box makes a nice case, and a makshift desk for your living room.Cons:No full sized option (though I do like the smaller size and would not want to go back now)Not as nice as the keyboards on the key laptops (I was really hoping the new keys would be like the ones on the new macbook pros (which I have and love the keyboard), but these are the same keys as from the previous keyboard. (Not really a bad thing, nor a con, but thought I'd bring it up).Bottom Line?Couldn't be happier, I highly recommend checking out this keyboard and making it a part of your home.  Just be sure to keep your box, it's a nice "case" and "desk". ;)
