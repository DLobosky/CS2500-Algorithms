We had been looking for McCormick Cracked Black Pepper ever since we tried a bottle & realized it had become a favorite. When this arrived it was not the same pepper, though. I studied the 1.75 oz empty spice bottle I had and it also says Gourmet Collections in which the cracked black pepper was a much finer consistency (although still 'cracked'). The grind/size of the cracked pepper in these 2 large containers is too large to refill the empty spice container I had planned to use. I didn't realize that food items are non returnable - I will be giving away a lot of pepper and coming up with creative ideas to use this pepper up. This has made me reluctant to purchase food from Amazon again as the picture does not look like the pepper I was sent. The pepper in the picture looks more like the grind I was looking for & the packaging that it was sent in does not have the red McCormick label across it, but does say in smaller print that it is packed by McCormick. Unless you need this much pepper & want the large size granules, I would not order.
