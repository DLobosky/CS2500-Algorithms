If you're like me, you might know that Steve McQueen used to wear a Rolex Diver's watch.However, since I can't afford $2,000.00 for a Rolex, I'm always looking for a more cost effective substitute.  To wit, I bought the Casio Men's MDV102-1AV Sea Analog Illuminator Dual LED Dive Watch just because I wanted to find out how it compares with my main watch, a Seiko Automatic Diver's SKX007J1.I'd like to mention first, that at one point I owned the Casio Men's AMW320R-1EV Marine Ana-Digi Dive Watch, which I didn't like all that much.  I eventually got rid of it because I never wore it.  It was too gaudy and awkward.  It didn't have the look or feel of a more expensive watch and it seemed like a cheap imitation.  As an example, the water resistance depth on the watch was 330 feet, which means that it was never really meant to be worn in or around water.Not so with the Casio Men's MDV102-1AV Sea Analog Illuminator Dual LED Dive Watch.  The look and feel of the watch is similar to the Seiko's and other more expensive Dive watches.  Even the water resistance depth on the watch is 660 feet.The water resistance depth on my Seiko Automatic Diver's SKX007J1 is 200 meters.  You can buy one of these for about $150.00 from various online dealers.  I bought mine as a replacement for an earlier Seiko Diver's watch I purchased domestically from a typical retail store.  I got many years of service from it, but it eventually began losing time, so I bought the newer Seiko from a dealer based in Hong Kong, and it pretty much proved to be a good buy.However, after six or seven years, the replacement actually gains time rather than loses it.  The gain is sometimes as much as ten minutes over the course of a week.  With that in mind, I decided to give the Casio Men's MDV102-1AV a try.  At $45.00, I felt that the item would probably be worth considering based on the reviews I saw in amazon.First, the good:The watch keeps excellent time, looks great and would be inexpensive to replace.  At $45.00 it's a great value.Then, there's the not so good:First, the bezel is a little hard to move on the first try and only moves in a counterclockwise direction.  After a few rotations it seems to get easier, however, I have to use my fingernails to do it, because the knurled edge is more on top of the bezel than on its side.Secondly, while most diver watches have aluminous dial, this has an LED light which can eat up battery power and is just another thing that can go wrong.Finally, while some other reviewers seem to find the watchband cheaply made and in need of immediate replacement, my objection isn't so much with the watchband as with the placement of the LED switch at two o'clock, which has at times, rubbed my wristbone raw.Here's the bottom line:Don't expect a quartz watch to last forever.An automatic watch will need to be cleaned every so often in order for it to keep good time.  Sometimes, just like a car, they will need an overhaul and at that point, the cost will be more expensive than a cleaning.If you buy a quartz watch, the battery will need to be replaced every so often.  If it's a diver's watch and you get the battery replaced, the water resistance depth will no longer be guaranteed, even if the replacement is performed by an authorized dealer.  And, just like an automatic watch, the quartz watch will need to be cleaned every so often.Personally, I will never purchase a quartz watch over forty or fifty dollars again.A few years ago, I had the experience of attempting to revive a Seiko Quartz Diver's watch that had been in storage for several years and was never used.  Due to the way the watch was stored, it would not keep good time even with a good battery, and I eventually ended up selling it to a collector who thought he could fix the problem.  For me, it probably would have been an expensive fix.For someone who's considering a Diver's watch, an automatic is one of the best ways to go.  However, if' you're looking for a great value, the Casio Men's MDV102-1AV Sea Analog Illuminator Dual LED Dive Watch is really a pretty good deal.
