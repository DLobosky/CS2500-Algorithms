Fans of G.K. Chesterton will enjoy this witty and entertaining mystery. It centers around the discovery at Notre Dame of an unpublished Father Brown story. The book is full of references to GKC, and the professor-detective  Roger Knight is an unusual and likable character. The first two books in  this series are also worth reading.
