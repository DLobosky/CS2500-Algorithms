I say this only so you'll know what I note is based upon scientific measurement, rather than simply perceived exertion. It can also monitor calories burned per minute and just during a workout so I have great measurement in how a fitness dvd does, regardless of whether I feel I'm burning a lot or not. And I've amassed a large fitness dvd library over the years because I workout to them 6 days a week so I have a few to compare it to...Caloric burn:okay, so that said, I've learned that most dvds will fall into cardio dvds which tend to burn more calories as you do them and strength dvds which burn less during the workout but helps to continue burning more throughout the rest of the day and develps muscle which also raises metabolism. I have a much harder time finding a dvd that does both. One of the Crunch dvds does this and the Biggest Loser dvds are all pretty good at it as well. This one is one of those rare exercise dvds that builds and tones but scorches the calories and keeps your heart rate up the entire time.Cueing:Excellent. In some dvds Kathy can trip me up BADLY but this one is excellent and very easy to follow along to in spite of it being fast paced and full of energy.Toning:Full body workout, even standing ab work. Head to toe.Cardio:Keeps your heart rate in the target fat burning zone AND builds muscleEquipment: You'll need hand weights. She suggests light and heavy to medium but I used 6-7 lb the whole time in each hand. My preferred weights.Instruction: Good instruction and advice on workout out safely and for the best effect.Energy: good but not with some of the "wooop! "yeahs!" that Kathy has in some dvds that get a tad overdone and irritating at times...this one is upbeat but no silly screaming out by the backout team.Conclusion: I can't really find anything I'd change about this one. I mean sometimes Kathy isnt super high energy as though she's really loving what she's doing but that's not a huge thing, just if I had to pick sometjhing in comparison to some other instructors...but the main thing is this one will do what it says...tone you and trim the fat and you'll be able to easily follow along.
