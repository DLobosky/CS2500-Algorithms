But please listen why it's worth going out of your way to get a far better-performing product, which is also far more environmentally friendly. If in the market for this battery, try to find a Rayovac Co101p2 battery pack. The Rayovac's Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH), so it's not toxic waste when spent. This one is toxic Nickel Cadmium (NiCd). The Rayovac has a (real) capacity of 1300 mAH (MilliAmp Hours), the highest I know of for this type battery pack. This generic one is rated at 650 mAH (.65 amp-hours), and that will degrade quicker than NiMH, and will have a shorter overall life. Plus, the Rayovac is around the same price, excluding the temptation for Super Saver Shipping. I wish Amazon sold the Rayovac, but they currently don't, so one must look elsewhere--I found mine locally at Fry's Electronics, but they can be had online too. Possibly becoming harder to find.Please see my full review of the genuine (but toxic) Panasonic replacement, vs the (superior) Rayovac Co101p2. Some phone & recharging tips:- Try to run down the battery as much as possible before recharging. This will keep the capacity high (true for both NiCd and NiMH). If you only ever talk for 20 minutes and then recharge it, at some point the battery will only last for 20 minutes (worse with Ni-Cads). Full drains prevent this. - When the battery runs out of charge, or if it is very low, charge right away. It's better to store these batteries charged, than drained.- Slower charging is easier on the battery, not that you have a choice. Most phones charge very slowly.- When the charge is complete, remove the phone from its base/charger. The chargers are dumb, and continue charging, and overcharging will slowly damage the battery. If you go on vacation, take your phone off the charger (ideally after fully charging).- It can help to buy 2 phones of the same type and switch out handsets, or one phone with multiple handsets, to fully drain handset batteries. Having a speakerphone built-into the base can sometimes help while swapping handsets.- Almost all tools and personal hygeine devices with integrated or proprietary battery packs use toxic NiCd batteries. It is illegal and unhealthy to throw those batteries away. Someday soon, NiCd batteries will not be made or sold in the US, voluntarily or not. They're already being banned in Europe. Good riddance anyway; they're barely cheaper, and inferior in every other way.- All rechargeable batteries (NiCd or not) can and should be recycled. It's free, just drop them off at a real electronics store like Radio Shack or Fry's Electronics. - If you have a dead rechargeable device, and you can't get the battery out (like a shaver or electric toothbrush), you can usually just drop off the whole part.- Even well cared-for batteries will eventually die, whether used or not. But how you treat them makes a huge difference.- Other types of batteries are the opposite of NiCd and NiMH, in that it is best to drain them as little as possible, and recharge frequently. Those include lithium-based batteries (cellphones and MP3 players) and lead-acid (car batteries). Lead-acid batteries can be dropped off for free recycling at any auto parts store, and lithiums can be dropped off anywhere you could drop off NiCd's.
