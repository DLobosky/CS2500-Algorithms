With lovely deep reds and oranges, chicken soup yellows, and forest greens, we read the story of a childless bube, who is preparing for a lonely Passover meal.  A shanda.  When, oy, her matzo ball comes alive.  A Matzo Boy Boy is born. Boy, Shmoy he tells her.  He is a man, and off to make his way in the world and not in a soup bowl.  He runs and she gives chase.  As do the tailor, the rabbi, the yenta, and a wolf that is not as smart as he thought.  In the forest, the matzo ball boy gets tired and hungry; he meets up with a poor man who isn't interested in giving chase.
