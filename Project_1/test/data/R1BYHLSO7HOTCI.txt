The quality deserves 5 stars. However I have trouble sometimes plugging in my Dell desktop. It will be 5 star with another and more convenient design of the cap.Update 1/29/2011I was right when I was concerned about the cap design. My DataTraveler 100 is still functioning but it was bended due to the heat from USB gates and now unable to withdraw/pull the head of USB in. I guess that it will stop working due to physical damage very soon. Unfortunately I lost the product barcode hence I can not get a replacement.Other than that, it has been working well over the 2 years of very hard using.
