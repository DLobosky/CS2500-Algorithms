WARNINGI'm not reviewing the movie (plenty of those around) but the disc content itself!!! As seen on my Philips 60", 1080i HDTV. And heard on My Polk Audio speakers powered by my Luxmann 400 Watts(RMS) Amp.-Video- 10/10 Film grain can be seen but it was put there intentionaly for artistic effect. weather you like it or not is a question of personal taste and not quality of the product.-Audio- (Dolby 5.1) 10/10 Just superb. Some surround effects (or lack there-of) could have been a little bit better but it's not enough to lower the perfect score.-Extras- 9/10 I didn't have time to watch them all (yet) but those I did see, were quite interesting and of good audio/visual quality.
