How funny they are depends on which side of the office desk you sit on.Since this is an early Dilbert series, Wally is not there. Alice has not yet made her appearance. Nor has Asok. Outsourcing is a decade away. E-mail is not yet a common workplace affliction. The World Wide Web is waiting for the browser. Dilbert is leading a lone charge, or suffering all alone at the hands of his boss. Dilbert is also less sarcastic than he is now - a reflection of the author's growing confidence that Dilbert may be a lowly cubicle dweller, but his Pointy Haired Boss cannot afford to fire him.
