After reading this book I entered a downward spiral which lasted nearly two years.   In this spiral I went from a place of security and peace and advancement in God, to at rock bottom feeling guilty most of the time, that I would drop into hell at any moment, and having urges to do horrible things not fit for this web page.    During this time period I sought help from other Christians, some of them very seasoned, and no one seem willing to make any clear statement on this book.  In fact the few people that I did encounter who were aware of this author only raved in an unbalanced way, him like most of the reviewers below do.  They zealously press you to read all of his books from cover to cover.  This encourages the spiral of feeling bad about yourself and crazy for thinking there is something wrong with this picture.  I also encountered a some who refused to talk about the subject as well as a few who were suffering through similar struggles, though each book affects each person differently.  As a background, I am now after healing, a staff member at a successful church in a major apostolic movement and Administrator of our Leadership Training School. I am submitted to authorities as it is one of our core beliefs, and I do not believe in Once Saved, Always Saved.I'm not saying that what happened to me will happen to everyone who reads this or other books by Bevere, but now know that I am not the only one. I believe it was a combination of my weak conscience at the time, and the spirit and errors in this book which allowed this to happen.  My main purpose for writing this review, is for those out there who may be feeling the same way, I want you to know that you can put this book down and never look back.  What is wrong with the teaching in this book is hard to pinpoint, but other reviewers have approached the problem.  It uses many scriptures, sometimes out of context to define what an "offense" is, and do so broadly enough that anyone who is honest will discover that they have some.  Then, it procedes to show you how horrible offenses really are, that they are the same thing as unforgiveness, and suggest that they will send you to hell.   It does also place a large burden on the offended person without offering much if anything in the way of help to overcome this horrible problem.  What makes this one particularly tricky is that if you have a problem with the book then you are "offended" and therefore all the more damned.   If the tone had really been encouraging instead of threatining, I think this could have been a great book on an important topic.  As it stands, I think it will hurt the weak, and I think it tends glorify the author in an unhealthy way.  I was finally freed of this problem after "randomly" attending a major conference where the main speaker came out publicly in opposition to the previous book "Thus Saith The Lord?" He proceeded to tell how he had taken the Matthew 18 route with Bevere, and even to the point of having him brought before the apostolic board, but that his concerns were not addressed, and so he had to publicly state that while John Bevere was clearly a gifted teacher that there was something in the book that was clearly not of God.  My sincere hope is that Mr. Bevere would put his significant talents and anointing something which heals as much as it reveals.
