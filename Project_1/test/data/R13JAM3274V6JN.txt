Anything?  Also quit wasting precious DVD space with free episodes from other series, give us a trailer, or promo code to download, use that extra space for better video quality, and extras.  Or put the extra episodes on a bonus disc.Problems, these discs have closed captioning, but no subtitles, which would be ok if everyone had a TV with CC, I do not, why cant Paramount put subtitles on their dvds?All in all, this is a worthwhile purchase, a great show, runtime is slightly more than 9 hours, and a big step up from other showtime dvd releases, hopefully this is a glance of a work in progress of how things will be from now on (hopefully they will release blu-ray/hd-dvd releases, add subtitles, shoot more extras, have more commentaries, and put less episodes on each disc.For those who have viewed HBO's ROME, that is how this show should of been handled, they have a "road to rome" feature, which uses the subtitle track to show key historic information, not to mention they have several commentary's, very high video quality, loads of interesting extras (2+ hours).  When I watched that dvd, I learned a lot, when I watch this, I don't get the background information, I don't get the significance of what is going on, such as in ROME, when a character cursed someone with their left hand, the track shows why that is significant, which adds more authenticity to the production.you can skip this next part, it is just me ranting about what I hate about this companies dvds in more detail.Now onto my woes and concerns.  CBS/Paramount/Showtime have been releasing some tv show dvds with disastrous results, seemingly every release.  This is the first release (likely why it has a higher retail than others) that acknowledges, showtime TV shows run around 50-60 minutes in Length.  With that in mind, This is the first season in a long time to restrict each dvd to 3 episodes (disc 2 states it has 4 episodes, but it only has 3).  I hope the respective companies will continue to release future showtime dvd releases with only 3 episodes a disc (or go the HBO route, and show 2)  This is the first showtime release in some while to have such rich colors and vibrancy, however the video quality is still not what it should be, watch any other recent dvd (not from this company) and you will notice sharp detail, and high contrast, here you get a soft picture, but great contrast (odd, since this show was shot and aired in HD)I rate this a 4, only because the show is great, and you should buy this dvd.  My complaints are not with this show, I eagerly await season 2 (march) but these dvds do need more work. I appreciate showtime selling their series for such a low price (28 dollars for 9+ hours, is a very good price), but I want more extras, commentary's, and better video quality with subtitles (not closed captioning).
