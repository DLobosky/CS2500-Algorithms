A witch is killed there and the Paranormal Squad closes the restaurant while they do their investigation.  Charlotte decides to do her own investigation, with help from witch Brendan and vampire Anatole.  There were good twists and turns in this books and I enjoyed the characters.  This book is the first in a series and I will continue to read this series.  I recommend it. [...]
