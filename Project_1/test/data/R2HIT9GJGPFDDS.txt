I'll just come right out and say it... I didn't like this book. Nope. I tried. So, so hard. It didn't happen. The book was well-written, it was clear and easy to understand. The story flowed, for the most part. However, the book was way too long so the story just seemed to stretch on and on (and on). The characters... I hated them. They were boring and very "flat". I couldn't really see them in my head and I just didn't like them. I thought that that the main character, Allison, was kind of annoying. She was still clinging to her human attachments and she purposely put herself in positions that made life difficult for herself. She questioned herself constantly and had weird internal battles with herself. Um Allison, you didn't even have to put yourself through that!!!The romantic interest in this book, Zeke, was weirdly young sounding. I thought that he was way younger than her, but then again I couldn't really remember how old she was supposed to be. He just seemed much less mature than her, she had been through so much and they just didn't go together as well as I would have hoped. Speaking of the romance, there wasn't much of it. There was some crushing going on, but there didn't seem to be any actual "love" developing. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but there could have been a bit more and maybe I would have been a bit more attached to the characters then. Of all the other characters mentioned, the only one I liked was the youngest boy, Caleb. He was the least annoying and frustrating of the characters. I hated all the others. They were either gossipy, had attitude problems, or were just there to fill up pages. For a lot of them, I didn't see a point in them being in the book at all.As I mentioned before, The Immortal Rules moved painfully slow. I just wanted things to happen, and when they did happen I was just left thinking two things: 1. What just happened? 2. Why was this even happening? I definitely don't want to read the sequel, I'm not interested. I can't completely say that the book was horrible, because it wasn't. I wasn't totally bored or angry at the book or anything that would make me stop reading it, but I just wasn't really into it. I know everyone seems to love it, but it wasn't for me. I'm just glad to be done with it so that I can move on to other books.
