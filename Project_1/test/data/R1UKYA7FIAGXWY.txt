I loved the dialogue. Elizabeth is a witty and quick tongued young woman that stills knows how to remain humble and true to her beliefs. There were moments of laughter and despair through the story that kept me turning pages. I had a terrible time putting this book down. The grace of the words and the flow of the story is a beautiful lyrical quality while griping the reader's heart with characters that move across the page with ease. The romance is sweeping and beautiful to quicken any heartbeat. I savored the moments of joy and love... and longed to throttle the villains. Compelling characters, a story that is well researched and brought into the life of the reader and a romance that made me hungry for more of their story, I can say without hesitation that I loved this book and never wished it to end.This review is my honest opinion. Thanks to the publishers through CFBA for my copy to review.
