This is my new favorite kitchen essential.  I love the fact that the lid works double duty as a medium sized skillet.  This is my first purchase of cast iron (I bought 3 pieces at the same time) and needless to say I was nervous - this was what my grandma cooked on but it is easy to use and even easier to clean.  It is not super non-stick the first few times of using it (but my chemically enhanced nonstick pans are so scratched that they stick too) but after a few washings and oil rub downs they are great.  The cast iron cookware works perfect on my glass top stove although with any cookware I would not recommend to slide it across the top.  These pieces of cast iron are heavy and require me to use both hands to maneuver them but I am very happy with moving over to a healthier way to cook.  I am also excited to see how long these last - my very scratched nonstick pans lasted only five years and are now in the trash.  I highly recommend this versatile piece of cookware!!
