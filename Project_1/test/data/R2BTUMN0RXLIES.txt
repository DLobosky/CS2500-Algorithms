I am a bit disappointed that Jo didn't remain how she was (not to give too much away) but it was still good and held my attention nonetheless.  David and Jo have got to be one of the most tortured couples I've ever read about. I also hated what happened to Lewis and Jonathan by the end. I'm looking forward to seeing what horrible destruction Kevin will cause.other books I enjoy: Kim Harrison- Rachel Morgan series, Jenna Black-Morgan Kingsley series, Larissa Ione- Demonica series, Ilona Andrews- Kate Daniels series, Richelle Mead- Georgina Kinkaid series and Dark Swan Series, Audra and Stella Price- Eververse series, Yasmine Galenorn- Sisters of the Moon series, Vicki Pettersson- Zodiac series; Jackie Keller- Hell on Earth series, T.A. Pratt- Marla Mason series; Mark Henry- Happy Hour of the Damned
