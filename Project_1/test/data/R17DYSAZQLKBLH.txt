If you're using the E9 with your computer, that won't pose a problem, but I wanted to hook it into my main stereo integrated amp.  I needed a 3.5mm stereo male plug to 2 RCA male plugs adapter.I used a RadioShack cable which wasn't bad, but I thought I could extract more performance from the E9.  I tried a Monster Cablelinks 3.5mm to RCA adapter with AudioQuest cables.  This combination didn't sound as good as the components appeared to be.  The CableLinks adapter was heavy, which put stress on the 3.5mm input jack, and that may have had something to do with the sub-par sound.I turned to the Monster Cable Interlink 400 MK II, and it's by far the best cable of the three.  It's only about 2 1/2 feet long, so be certain it will work in your installation.  The 3.5mm end is light--it won't stress the "Line In" jack.Monster Cable comes in for a fair amount of bashing, and some of their products are better than others.  The sound quality of the E9 through this cable is excellent.  The price is fair for the quality of construction.  Highly recommended.
