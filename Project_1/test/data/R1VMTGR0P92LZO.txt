This movie is a must-have for ANY Disney collection!  It is, in a word,  ADORABLE!  Made in the &quot;old-syle&quot; Winnie The Pooh, this new  release does NOT disappoint!  My husband and I found it incredibly  entertaining; never boring, and of course, our five year old daughter is  just crazy about it!  In the movie, Bouncy Trouncy Tigger, tired of being  the &quot;only one&quot; I guess, sets out to discover his &quot;family  tree.&quot;  In the end, though, he discovers who is REAL family is, and  has been, all along.  Very cute, very watchable, really funny at times, and  just an all-around wonderful movie to own for the entire family!  My  opinion is, if you haven't seen the Tigger Movie yet, your family is REALLY  missing out on a good one!  TTFN!
