On the adjoining wall, the "point" of the bar wore away a layer of paint, and where the bar braces against the doorframe, the black foam padding grained into the paint and left a mark. The box I purchased (at a local drugstore) did not contain the "ab straps," so I can't speak to whether they are or aren't included.Apart from that, it's a great chin-up bar. Solid, holds up well, assembled quickly, supports my 180 lbs easily.
