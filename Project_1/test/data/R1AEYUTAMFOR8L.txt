The bags work the same (they are great), but they are very hard to rip from the roll. The wallet style is SO much easier.  (No more expensive, either, when you figure out the per-bag price.) Bags work exactly as advertised - it's great to have flushable ones.  We have the low-flow toilets and haven't had any problems at all with the bags going down. I flush, then drop the bag in as the water is swirling around. They always go right down.  (Small dog at the moment, though - not sure about having the bag filled with a big dog's stuff.)  Oh, and if your house is humid? Don't leave an unused bag out in the open - they tend to get a bit sort of sticky. Just stick it back in the little wallet/envelope thing.Great item, I totally recommend it, but definitely stick with these wallet-style containers rather than the rolls.
