Enjoying this book and another similar one. I'm always looking for new approaches to good food on the road not just on the trail. We want to travel lighter and yet some of us enjoy good food too not to mention more healthy foods. I hate the pre-made everything or fancy soup mixes because they are loaded with salt. I'm sensitive to salts due to edema and meniers problems so this does matter. Making your own from scratch and thinking outside the box and boxes literally here really is worth making this a hobby of sorts. We do...and this is just a good starter book if not an addition worth having in your arsenal of books for ideas and creative tools to get you going in the right direction. Covers a lot of foods not just limited to one type or style. Breaks down in easy to understand format. I'm enjoying it as a quick read for now. May return to it in more detail to try out specific recipes and slight variations on a few later. For now it's just reading material due to a cold late start to summer fun up here. NO river floating for now as it's still in run off and lots of snow in the high country is going to keep it there. Hiking is also on hold as the high country....snow chutes and some roads are still closed not to mention hike paths themselves as you get higher...I do recommend this book for those who do enjoy packaging their own foods together. There are tons of sources these days for freeze dried peas and vegi's and fruits that didn't use to exist. So these types of books are wonderful and helpful. I never follow a recipe to the T...always changing it up or using it as an idea platform. In this case....keeping it light or lighter even works better.
