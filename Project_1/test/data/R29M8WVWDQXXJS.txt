This is my 3rd Logitech mouse.  This is a small very inexpensive mouse, perfect for the laptop or netbook.  It comes in many colors, mine is black and silver, so you can pick a different color for you and your wife.It comes with a tiny nano receiver, which fits in a small compartment under the battery cover.  It also comes with a Duracell battery, which should last you about 6 months.The mouse is small, but fits most hands well.Once again, Logitech has done well!
