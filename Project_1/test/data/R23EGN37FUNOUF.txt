Not only does she make the team, she makes varsity and becomes the best swimmer on the team. Her coach talks with her about the future and the possibilities of college scholarships. Kate is excited, but her new schedule has her so busy, it's hard to keep up. Some of the other girls on the team share their secret with Kate: coffee and energy drinks. Kate knows that her coach probably wouldn't like them drinking so much caffeine, but it's legal, so it's okay, right? But as the season progresses to the state championship and the opportunity to set a new record and impress a college scout, Kate is beyond stresses out. When her teammates offer her a way to get through the day that Kate knows is illegal, what will she do?You decide.This is another Choose Your Own Scenario book, where you read all about Kate's life and then choose what she will do next. Then the book has two alternate endings, one for each choice Kate could make.I love this series! Whether Kate chose to break the law or stay true to her convictions, she was able to push through the consequences and find redemption. The enormity of the choice she faced played out in both endings and showed how much power one right or wrong choice can make in a person's life.I highly recommend this series to all girls. These are fun stores with relatable characters that give the reader a chance to see two sides of one choice.
