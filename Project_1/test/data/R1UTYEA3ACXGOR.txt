Written by Alexander Laing, as "a medical student", I found this novel to be years ahead of its' time, that time being the mid-1930's.The plot involves this creepy physician, in an out-of-the-way Maine medical school, not one but two psychopaths, a "locked room" murder mystery, "monsters" (the term was once used for babies with severe, disfiguring birth defects)...how can this list NOT make you a bit curious?The tone of the book is spot-on. Verisimilitude drips from the pages, being liberally sprinkled with medical jargon and footnotes. The atmosphere is mostly one of dread; our narrator, the unfortunate David Saunders, offers bits of humor here and there, getting bone-dry and dark as hell as the book unfolds. I discovered this novel on a list of classic horror tales...it seems anyone who has read this had enjoyed it.Add me to the list.
