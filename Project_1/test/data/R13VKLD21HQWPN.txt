But, just when all seems to be going well, her daughter, Jacquie, is kidnapped while they are at the mall. Of course, this brings Jasmine to her knees. She does not know where to turn. She believes her husband, Hosea, cannot relate to her horror since he is not the biological father of her daughter. When Jacquie's biological father, Brian Lewis, shows up to help in the search, Jasmine believes he is the perfect solution to her pain. She senses a connection with Brian that could destroy her marriage. In SINS OF THE MOTHER by Victoria Christopher Murray, Jasmine is not sure if her past sins are catching up with her and her daughter is suffering the consequences. Will her daughter be found? Will Jasmine hold on to her faith or revert to her old ways? Murray is a writer's writer. She is able to captivate the reader and hold your attention all the way to the end. Murray's fascinating lessons on forgiveness, love and faith make you take a look at yourself and ask what would you do in this situation? Would your faith be unwavering? Would you doubt God? Once I picked up the book, I could not put it down. I highly recommend SINS OF THE MOTHER for all lovers of the saga that is Jasmine's life. I thoroughly enjoyed it! This book was provided courtesy of the publisher for review. Donnica CopelandAPOOO BookClubSista Talk Book Club
