These audio books were written by Anne Emerick, translated from English into Spanish, and put together on CD with both versions being read by bilingual actors.  Each chapter is first read sentence by sentence.  First, a sentence is read in English; then it is read in Spanish.  When the entire chapter has been read sentence by sentence, it is then read all the way through in Spanish.Designed to help people learn Spanish without the `work' of a traditional language program, No Work Spanish takes a very different approach to language education.  This approach is very modern, and incredibly inductive.  I don't feel that this approach is all one would need to become fluent in a language, or even to learn to read the language, but I do feel that these audio books have their place.In order to become fluent every student needs to have a good input of audio from the target language.  In order to really understand the cadences and syntax of a language, one needs to hear it spoken, and No Work Spanish does a great job of this.  Still, I feel it is better suited as a supplement.  Adults who have had former instruction in Spanish will be able to pick up a great deal of their vocabulary again as they brush off those rusty Spanish skills.  However, children will learn much faster with a more traditional, direct-input approach.  I believe it would take quite a while to build a workable vocabulary from such an inductive approach.  I recommend trying out No Work Spanish as an adjunct to such a program, not as a replacement.In that supplementary role, I think No Work Spanish is great!  It is really a unique product, and my daughter (who hasn't had any formal Spanish at this point) told me that she could pick out similarities between Spanish and English words just from overhearing me listening to the audio CDs.  I think that is pretty neat!  These are great to listen to when your hands are busy with some other work - when you are driving, washing dishes, cleaning house etc.Poster Girl is a very fun Spanish reinforcement audio.  Read over two CDs by a female voice actor, this audio book has the added advantage of some of the vocabulary words being presented BEFORE the chapter is read.  This direct presentation of vocabulary helps listeners pick up the words presented more quickly than the strictly inductive approach of the first story.  This is the No Work Spanish version of a chapter book written for primary grade students (under the same title) and it follows a girl named Paula through her challenges in trying to make a better science poster than the girl who always manages to out-do her.  My eight-year-old was interested in sitting and listening to this one for a while, so I think it's a great fit for young, female students.
