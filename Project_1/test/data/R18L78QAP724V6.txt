Welcome to the first film of director Sam Raimi's career, and the first film of what would become a massive cult following for Bruce Campbell.  Here in this film Raimi answers the age-old cinema question:  how do you create a work of art with little money and very [bad] actors?  Answer:  some [great] makeup effects and very psychedelic camera zoom shots.  For pointless trivia, it is about 15 minutes into the movie before someone does the first really stupid thing (unless you count renting an abandoned cabin in middle of the Tennessee woods an act of stupidity in and of itself), namely playing a reel-to-reel tape of a demon invokation spell.  After that, the hits just keep coming.  And therein lies the genius of the movie.  It is so fast-paced that it leaves little room for predictability right up to the ending. Far from being sentimental, Raimi pulls no punches with the carnage, which includes a wonderfully choreographed vine-rape scene!  If you are looking for plausibility, check that at the door; if you are looking for convincing acting, rent Silence of the Lambs...
