Its typical underlying platitudes about crazy parenting and light-weight people living in suburbia are those of someone assuming a superior pose. For 90% of this book, Perrotta serves up a soap-opera parade of losers, perverts, frustrated moms, selfish thirty somethings, and bratty toddlers who are just an annoying lot of crybabies and throwers of tantrums. Know what I think? I think Mr. Perrotta's got problems, but he should keep them to himself and not think all of suburbia is suffering from his frustrations. Oh yes, the ending redeems everything, but in the meantime, we are made to go from one short-circuited life to another, caring but not caring about couple A's weird marriage, and couple B's weird marriage, and couple C's weird marriage. Hey, is anybody out there worth a damn? Or are we all sniffing panties and fantasizing about what we could have been? My experience tells me this novel is make-believe from the author's world, not from the real world. I didn't care much about these people, although I do admit this is a fast read, like rifling through the NY Post or some other raggy newspaper. Not great. Not worth my time. And I regret having read it.
