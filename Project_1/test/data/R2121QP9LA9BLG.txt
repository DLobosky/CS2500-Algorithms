However, if you use them in a typical street fight, you can expect to spend time in prison. Personal injury lawyers may also come after you. Children especially should not be allowed to read this book.This book heavily focuses on using the head/hair grab to control your opponent's body movement, followed by repeated strikes to vital areas such as the eyes, ears, throat, neck, back of the head, knee, and groin. This book is basically a bunch of moves that are not even allowed in the UFC. (The UFC lists its fouls on its web site. Anyone who has read this book will recognize many of the fouls listed.)The techniques taught in this book are far more effective than what you'd learn studying a traditional martial art like Tae Kwon Do. This book is written for people who have no martial arts background, but I would recommend it for anyone studying a modern martial art like Brazilian Jujutsu or Krav Maga, as well.
