Each episode is based on a story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930) who wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Sherlock Holmes.(1) "The Crooked Man" (13 scenes; based on the 1893 story).A distinguished colonel is found dead in a room of his villa with his unconscious wife beside him.  Sherlock is asked to investigate.  His sleuthing leads him to a "crooked man," who is "an old acquaintance" of the colonel's wife.  Be sure to see the fantastic acting by Norman Jones who plays the crooked man.(2) "The Speckled Band" (10 scenes; based on the 1892 story).A woman asks Sherlock to investigate the mysterious past death of her sister.  "Holmes the meddler" discovers that the woman's life may be in jeopardy.  The quotation by Sherlock that titles this review is found in this episode.Brett (who made 41 Sherlock Holmes' dramas between 1984 and 1994) is in top-form in these two episodes since they were made before the time of his health problems.  He captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performances.The costumes, background music, and cinematography are quite well done.  In my case, I found the picture quality and acoustic quality of this DVD to be practically perfect.Finally, this DVD has 3 extras.  I found these interesting.  Newcomers to the series should especially enjoy them.In conclusion, be sure to view this DVD and see why it won a 1988 Swedish Academy of Detection Award!!(1983;  110 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)+++++
