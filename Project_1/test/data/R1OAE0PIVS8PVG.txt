I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!  I buy lots of sewing, knitting, and embroidery books and this is by far the best one I've bought in quite a while.  The designs are unique and unusual, not the boring, outdated, typical geese, teddy bears, etc. that are usually found in embroidery/cross-stitch books.  The designs are whimsical and delightful, I can't wait to get started on them.  The photographs are beautiful throughout the book, there are full charts and ideas for stitching on all sorts of things.  A very creative, inspiring book.  Every page is a delight!
