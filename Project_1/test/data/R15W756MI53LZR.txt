A man who escapes from jail just before his sentencing for arson and homicide hides from his pursuers with a beautiful landlady played by Jean Arthur.  She has another border, a famous lawyer who fails to see the human side of the law and the consequences for the accused.  Discussion about fairness and how guilt is determined make up a considerable amount of the dialogue here but it is hardly worthless.  A good movie with a little food for thought.
