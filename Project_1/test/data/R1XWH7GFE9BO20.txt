Sharpie markers are like post-it notes.  You have to have them and they do what you expect them to.  Colors are true to cap colors. They are not meant to be paint brushes, even though they get used that way so they might seem like HP Print Cartridges (always running out of ink), but they don't dry up like them.  12 colors is really more than one needs.  They should ditch the yellow or lime as they are hard to see anyway and add a second black marker.
