I will refrain from any comments regarding the nature of the translation, leaving that for those far more learned than myself.I have downloaded several versions of the Holy Bible and I am pretty pleased with this one.  The Table of Contents is easy to access.  The individual books listed are centered and run down the middle of the page.  After selecting a book, you are taken to that book with the first line(s) being a list of selectable chapters followed by the beginning of the text of that book.  You can start to read or you can select a line of chapters which will take you to a sub-menu which allows you to select the specific chapter you want.The main problem I had with this set-up is the centering of the text sometimes made it difficult to select a specific book without occasionally hitting the one on top or bottom and having to go back and try again.  Also, the Chapter list sub-menu seems to be an annoying additional step.The best "Kindle" set-up I've found so far is the Holy Bible: New American Standard Bible (NASB) (Kindle Edition) by The Lockman Foundation.  The TOC is set up with a right justification so the text is right next to the cursor.  Once you select a book, you are taken to a right justified chapter list.  Selecting a chapter takes you right to the text, avoiding the sub-menu step.  This, for me, has proven to be the most efficient style of navigation for Bible Study and reading.I will continue my collection of Kindle Bible versions, but I'm not going to waste any more money on versions which are not optimized for the Kindle with right justification of selectable lists.
