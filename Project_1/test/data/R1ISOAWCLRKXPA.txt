For although the author covers the ground thoroughly and his descriptions of other scholars' works are thorough and unbiased (which is certainly welcome in this area), and his documentation is more than adequate, the reader will come away with very little this is new or provocative. It could be argued that "new or provocative" are not necessarily  virtues and a strong scholarly book, even if pedestrian, is always welcome. That would be true, except for the extremely high level at which this book is addressed. I doubt that beginning students could even read it, much less gain from it. It's clearly for the advanced scholar, yet without offering much that is new, what is the purpose? The authors tells us in the early pages that he chose not to "dumb down" his approach, and I think it was a bad decision. A dumb-downed version of this book would be an excellent introduction for the beginning student.Of course the book is not without its errors, especially with regard to Jesus' relationship to his family. McClymond makes the common mistake of accepting Mark 3:21 with its usual translation which is clearly incorrect (i.e., the reference is to his disciples, not to his family who do not show up for 10 more verses). He also believes that Jesus was born in 4 B.C. (I prefer 6), that he lived in Nazareth (which archeologists tell us didn't even exist until mid 1st Century A.D.), that he and his father were carpenters (I prefer the "tecton" translation as master craftsman which helps explain Jesus' education, something a carpenter would not have had), that Jesus died in 30 A.D. (36 is the obvious date), etc.  He also makes the mistake of claiming that Jesus is identified in the works of Pliny and Suetonius, when the fact is that "Christ" or the "anointed one" is identified without any reference to the person named Jesus/Joshua. Since there were many anointed ones, the reference to "Christ" was hardly definitive for 1st Century writers.  Advanced students will probably want to take a look at this book because it is so well done and well documented, but beginning students should be forewarned.PS - I wish Amazon allowed more than 5 stars. This is clearly an excellent book, but I can only assign 3 stars using their current system.
