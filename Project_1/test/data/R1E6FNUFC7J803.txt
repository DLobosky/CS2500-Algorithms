After seeing Dr Phillip C.McGraw on Oprah a number of times,and his in-your-face,tell it like it is attitude,I wanted to take the journey into my own self.Dr Phil's book is very simple to read,but you have to work.There's writen assignments in every chapter.The main point is what we already know,but are afraid to admit.You'll find out what I'm talking about after  you read this fantastic book.The Ten Laws of Life  will stay with me forever .My favorite line  is&quot; That You are the only You that will ever exist in the entire history of the world.Good or Bad,YOU are the one accountable for you life.&quot;
