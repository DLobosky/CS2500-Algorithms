This is a pretty good Sci-Fi series that gets better as you go. I was a bit unsure at first, but I was really involved by the end and hated to see it end. The characters developed very well and the story line was pretty good.Definitely a low budget affair and some of the writing a bit amateurish, but the cast and crew really seemed to give it a go and won me over. The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.If you like Sci-fi along the lines of Firefly, you should enjoy this. In fact, I found many things here that seemed to have been payed homage in the Firefly series itself. I won't spoil your fun, but they're pretty clear. Firefly had much better scripts, but this series has heart. Money well spent and good enough that I will enjoy watching many times over.2011-12-07 The current price has dropped below $9 which makes this a steal and a great value.  I still find myself intrigued by this series and coming back to it from time to time.  There's a touch of "magic" in this production, clearly a lot of the people involved put their heart into what they were doing.
