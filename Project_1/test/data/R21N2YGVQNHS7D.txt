We keep our house temp at 68 degrees so it's not our house that's warm!While it's good that it keeps them warm, I'm terrified of SIDS (We've already buried our first child who was Stillborn) and it's thought that overheating could be a contributor to it, so that's the only thing that makes me a little nervous and find it interesting that a product said to promote safe sleeping would cause so much overheating.
