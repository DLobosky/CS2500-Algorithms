It's also the first Mamas & Papas album that was released after Cass died in 1974. There's an interesting selection of songs and sequencing on this album. It contains all the big hit singles, but also includes 2 of their best album tracks that totally represent the group's sound - STRAIGHT SHOOTER and SOMEBODY GROOVY, plus the then-neglected single GLAD TO BE UNHAPPY, which only made one prior M&P collection, GOLDEN ERA VOLUME 2 in 1968. It includes the liner notes reprinted from IF YOU CAN BELIEVE YOUR EYES AND EARS, and a somewhat wacked-out artist rendering sketch from the PEOPLE LIKE US cover. This was a series entitled THE ABC COLLECTION that ABC Records issued during that time on their biggest artists , before the company soon folded and was bought by MCA Records. The cover opens up like an envelope with the custom inner sleeve artwork inside.   Side One: MONDAY MONDAY, TWELVE-THIRTY, I SAW HER AGAIN LAST NIGHT , I CALL YOUR NAME , CREEQUE ALLEY, WORDS OF LOVE, DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE.  Side Two: GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, LOOK THROUGH MY WINDOW, SOMEBODY GROOVY, STRAIGHT SHOOTER, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME, GLAD TO BE UNHAPPY, CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'.
