If you liked the "Space" portion of the Dead's second set, you'll want both these. Of the two, while this one is shorter (45 minutes), it's also more interesting. The second track contains essentially a long Dark Star jam with nothing added, and it's awesome. Transitive Axis never really goes anyplace. It's just bits of Dark Star. It's fun if you are "under the influence," if you catch my drift, in a way that music becomes magical when high. However, Mirror Ashes, which came out about two years after Transitive Axis, holds up much better, both under the influence and just as awesome music to drift off to sleep to. I have Mirror Ashes essentially permanently on my iPod and when I have a hard time going to sleep, I put it on and by the time it ends 45-odd minutes later, I am always asleep. The music just carries me away.I bought these several ways, first as a single CD when Transitive Axis came out. Then when Mirror Ashes was released, it was released as a two-CD set, so I bought that two-CD set and gave the first one to a friend.I loved "Space" and I especially loved Dark Star, so this is essential owning for me. I've now got the CDs backed up to 320 kbs mp3 files, as well as 128 kbs (for my iPod). If you love playing with sound, and Dark Star and Space have significance for you, then I'd download this, and then if you like what you hear, then I'd get Transitive Axis. Just remember, while they are similar, they're also very difference.Enjoy the trip.
