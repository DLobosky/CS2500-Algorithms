This book can be enjoyed by anyone who wants to learn more about the state of Tennessee. The neat thing about it is that the rhyming text will delight toddlers, but the information in the sidebars can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Mr. Shoulders takes us from Beale Street to the Trail of Tears. It's an informative journey enhanced by Langton's illustrations. Especially pleasing are those that deal with nature. I highly recommend this book.
