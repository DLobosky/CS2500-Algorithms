This book helps us parents to make sure our children know what they need to know. This is really an important book for our childen. Use this book as a valuable guide. It really is a great book.America's educational system cannot teach our children everything they need to know. Parents are primarily responsible for teaching our children what is most important in life. YOU need to devote your time and intellect to this goal. Parents are the primary source of learning in our country. This book tells you what you need to do to supplement your child's learning. Use this book to help you do your job.One word of warning: There are a few subtle conservative political action requests in this book. I urge you, if you are a moderate or liberal, to not let these very minor suggestions deter you from buying this excellent book. The material is really excellent. And it is true that not all children learn the same.But what is true is that parents need to be completely involved, and there are some tried-and-true lessons YOU need to teach your children. As a start, help your child to learn as many words as possible by age two, and then foster a rich environment of reading. Read to your child. Buy your child lots of great books. Teach (yes, you) your child to read well before first grade, at least, and make a strong reading start before Kindergarten.And read this book.I praise Mr. Bennett and his colleague for putting together an outstanding book grounded in excellent education fundamentals.I also recommend the excellent book by E. D. Hirsch (editor) called "What You're First Grader Need to know." This series continues through other grades, though I don't know anything about the other ones. Also get the "Dorling Kindersley Children's Illustrated Encyclopedia". And enrich your children's lives with the music of the greatest children's musician of all time, Raffi. Do a search for "Raffi." He's the Mr. Rogers of music. It will pay dividends many times over.Teach your children.
