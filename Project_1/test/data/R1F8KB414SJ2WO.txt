But if you are planning to get a Blu-ray player, keep in mind that these players are still under the Profile 1.0 banner.The profile 1.0 brings a basic set of features and leave other features available only on the future player profiles. Player profile 1.1 is effective on October 31st meaning that the newer players announced after such date must have the profile 1.1 (this player is already available so it is not profile 1.1). Player profile 2.0 - the final profile - has no date yet announced.  Like any High Definition technology, one cannot say this player is bad. It upconverts your standard definition DVDs nicely and will give you a list features that will make the delight of any AV enthusiast. It does output 1080p image and that alone is a great thing to see.GOOD POINTS (something that can make you buy it)-Upconversion of standard definition DVDs.-Lan connection for online software updates.-It supports HDMI 1.3.-Price (compared to other Blu-ray stand alone players only).BAD POINTS (something that will make you buy other Blu-ray model or go HD DVD)-Still a player profile 1.0 (I'm not sure if it is possible to upgrade this player to profile 1.1). This is a half-developed minimum player profile. So it has no dual stream video decoding, for PiP and other advanced interactive functions (only available in HD DVD players for now).-Region coding (if you only care for "Zone-A" discs, this may not be a problem for you. Otherwise you may try HD DVD which is a region free format).-Price (compared to the cheaper PS3 and HD DVD players).Still, for this price, this blu-ray player can be a good choice. OR you'll want to go for the cheaper PS3, OR wait for a Profile 1.1/2.0 player to come out, OR take a look at a HD DVD player.
