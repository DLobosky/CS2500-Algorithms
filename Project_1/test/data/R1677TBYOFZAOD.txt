I grew up with the Guinness Book of World Records, and loved it. I'd devour each new edition, from cover to cover. I love facts and inane trivia, and the Guinness Book was made for people like me. The "Guinness World Records"- what these books have become- is not the same book. It is mostly pictures. I give it two stars because some records are still present. But the new format of the book seems to be so filled with pictures that there is no room for many important records, and hence much is missing. Small black and white pictures aren't as pretty, but they allow the reader to find what they are looking for. Now, when I want to find a record, I go back to 1998, as I still have that copy. If I want to see pretty pictures and the occasional updated record, I'll look at these newer editions.This review refers to the 2001 edition.
