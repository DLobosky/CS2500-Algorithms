The band went through major personnel changes (departures) prior to the recording of this CD.  While this is an acoustic work, it's really not that radical a departure from their last CD with the full band, "Un", which had similar instrumentation and feel.  Regardless, it's one of their strongest discs.  The vocal work, always a strength, is even finer here if that can be imagined, with some gorgeous singing and a capella work.  The songs are outstanding, and the lyrics as pointed as always.  This is one of the real peaks in Chumbawamba's amazing body of work, and can be recommended without reservation.  Easily, it's one of their five best CDs, joining (in no particular order): Shhh, Anarchy, WYSIWYG, and Tubthumper.  With an honorable mention to Un.
