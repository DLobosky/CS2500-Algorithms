These are great batteries, but perform similarly to Tenergy LSDs, and with Tenergy's being slightly lower in price why pay the albeit small premium in price? These batteries hold a charge well. As a parent of 2 boys in which it seems every toy has 2-4 AA or AAA batteries, these are a life saver. They seem to be able to run my sons' high demand devices just as long as an alkaline or other NIMH brands that cost alot more.
