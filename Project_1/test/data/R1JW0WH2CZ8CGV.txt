I bought these three series. LORD OF THE RINGS  when the first day came out I bought them separate. Of course loved the movie and love to have them in my DVD collection...but if u DVD collector like I am, and buying DVDS like crazy, then...stay away buying DVDS these days...this series and a lots titles new and old movies going to come out on "BLU-RAY" soon by summer and then start buying DVDS again like I will do!!! That u get the crystal clear picture with the best audio..  I stop buying DVDS from now, and waiting for BLU-RAY hit the store this summer!! Skip these cheap  prices and B.S in any  titles movies these days because they want to get the rid of them and replace them with BLU-RAY soon enough!! Better an wait then be sorry!!
