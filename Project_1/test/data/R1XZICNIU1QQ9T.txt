I chose this one because of the price, the 3 cup size, the Sanyo reputation, and the features.  And a very wise choice it was!!  My first impression as I pulled it out of the box was that it was extremely attractive and modern looking; the web site picture does not do it justice.  The body is white with stainless steel accents in a very up-to-date style.  It is small and easily tucked away if need be, the cord is retractable.  The buttons are large and easy to read and access.  The menu features a setting for white, brown, porridge, quick cook and a Korean dish called Dol sot bi bim bab.  The instruction book is easy to follow, although you really almost would not need it as the controls are very self-explanatory.  Included in the guide are some simple recipes, including one for the dol sot bi bim bab.  The main stand out for this model is a bowl that is built like a tank and is titanium nonstick.  It is 5 mm. thick--by far the thickest I have seen on any micom rice cooker.  It distributes the heat consistently all around the circumference of the bowl.  Another plus is that it has separate markings for brown and sweet rice, showing the necessary higher water level needed for those types of rice.  Since I mainly cook brown rice, the separate menu selection for brown and separate bowl markings for brown win this cooker very high marks with me.  The bowl is a three cup size, but two cups fill it very full.  This is the perfect size for a single person or maybe a couple, but a larger group might want to go up to the 5 cup size.  (I might get one of those myself....I like this cooker that much!)  I believe the 5 cup also has a steam and slow cook function that the smaller unit does not have.  Not a big deal for me but for some might be a selling point.I have cooked brown, japanese white, jasmine, brown basamati, and even Uncle Ben in this and basically had perfect rice each time.  I have also used the timer to have it ready when I come home from work!  My only gripe is that it takes 1 1/2 hours to cook brown rice, so if I don't use the timer, I have to wait on it.  However, the results ARE worth the wait.  Oh, a couple quirks.  The condensation cup is on the top of the cooker--empty it each time, or else if you move the unit, it could spash water down the front of it.  I learned the hard way.  Also, the clock will read 0.00 at noon instead of 12:00--the 0.00 does NOT mean the rice is ready if you happen to be cooking around that time.  Also learned the hard way.  Clean up is simple, the pieces come off and reassemble without any brain work.  More work than a traditional glass lid cooker perhaps, but again, worth it.Amazon seemed to have the best price and included free shipping for this model   Wal-mart and Best Buy also carry it, but they were not in stock (in my area anyway) and had to be ordered--and you pay shipping.  The unit has a one year warranty.  It is made in China.  In short, this is a very attractive, well-built, well-designed little unit that turns out perfect rice at an incredible price.  If you have any thoughts about getting a micom rice cooker, get this one!!
