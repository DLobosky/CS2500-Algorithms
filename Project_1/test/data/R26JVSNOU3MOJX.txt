The author shows how inter-related the books are and how they they corelate to each other. The author also shows that the book of Daniel is opened up through the book of Revelation and shows where we are in this time of the end. You will find biblical prophecy revealed using the line by line, precept by precept and word by word study using the bible only as it's expositor. This author has truly been blessed with a heavenly wisdom as the book reveals to us truths that only can come directly from the Creator of all there is. Study this book in prayer using the bible and be blessed with a truth that will open your heart to the Savior himself. We are saved through grace....He is coming soon! The above review was written about Getting it all Together Daniel and Revelation. The book's author got together with this author and actually came up with a colorful and extremely well documented/written book which improved on the first book. The truths did not change, but more information has been revealed than was previously. More was revealed as we get closer to the end. Commend both authors and highly recommend purchase of the book.
