It is important to practice at the range with live ammo, but a couple times a week is out of the question, plus the range is closed at night and not worth the trip for a quick session.That's why I bought this laser target and companion LaserLyte Laser Trainer Pro [...] .  It can fill the gaps between trips to the range every two or three weeks.  At $241 for this Laserlyte laser target and and LaserLyte Laser Trainer Pro, I figure a four to five month breakeven.I bought this to use with both .45 ACP and 9mm pistols, so I got the LaserLyte Laser Trainer Pro to use with it instead of one of the lasers that look like and load like, a bullet in a specific caliber.  In actual use, I have set it up with markers for the three distances for the concealed handgun license test and also for 25ft--about the longest distance I can set up indoors.  I hesitate to try it outside, where someone might see me and get nervous, or worse!It might be helpful if the target were a little larger, in order to record my really wide shots, but as it is, I hit the target 95% of the time at 25ft.  The greater challenge is "hitting" the little red circle to display the hits, then hitting the other red dot to reset the box.  All in all, a pretty good challenge.  I'm using a semi-auto, so I have to cycle the slide just a bit between shots to cock the striker.  With a double action pistol or revolver, you could use this normally for repeated shots.All in all, a clever design that appears well made.
