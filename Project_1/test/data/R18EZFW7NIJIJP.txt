Here's a new edition of one of the difficult-to- find Holmes novels written by Frank Thomas in the early 1980s.  Holmes and Watson tackle a difficult and confusing case that first seems to turn on shady  international finance, later on the theft of four priceless oil paintings.   If Frank's take on Sherlock is new to you, I might mention that this  Sherlock, while being very true to Conan Doyle's original, is more like Doc  Savage and the Shadow in depending heavily on a small team of aides, each  with a unique talent.  There are some bizarre glitches in the printing  of this trade paperback, including a &quot;footnote&quot; that appears in  the midst of the text on p. 7, but actually belongs in a later chapter,  perhaps Ch.10. Chapter 15 is (for no reason) in a totally different font  from the other chapters.  And etc. Fortunately the story moves so well, and  events are so continually surprising, that the typesetting peculiarities  are not at all distracting.  It's great to have this book in print  again, and I hope the other Thomas Holmes novels will soon follow.  They  belong on everyone's shelf of Holmes pastiches.  Indeed, they deserve a  special place of merit.
