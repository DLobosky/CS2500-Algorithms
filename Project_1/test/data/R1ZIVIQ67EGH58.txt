I must admit I am a Rutger Hauer fan, and have been ever since &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; was released in 1985.  And as an English teacher, I am always looking for new videos to augment my literature units.  This  superb version of Jack London's tale of unconditional love, survival of the  fittest and London's belief that all living creatures including man are  capable of reverting to their wild beginnings has been the perfect visual  companion to my teaching the novel &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; for the  past two years - and it has Rutger Hauer to boot!  Exquisitely photographed  in muted tones, &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; tells the story of Buck, the  handsome Newfoundland, who is kidnapped because of his massive size from  his pampered life in California, and endures horrific hardships, numerous  owners, and self-discovery as he is taken to man's &quot;holy grail&quot; -  the Klondike Gold Rush.  Rutger Hauer protrays John Thornton, the grizzled  but kind man who saves Buck's life and introduces Buck to the unbridled joy  of unconditional love.  Richard Dreyfuss narrates beautifully, giving the  viewer an opportunity to actually experience bits and pieces of London's  exquisite prose.  Although a number of film versions have previously been  made, this version is by far superior!  Not only is Buck accurately  represented by the actual breed that London wrote about, but the screenplay  follows the story most faithfully.  Except for the brief insertion of a  saloon girl to romance Thornton for a moment and the minimizing of a number  of Buck's owners, this film visually portrays the fear and growth and  finally the trust and love that Buck experiences.  I do recommend, however,  that to fully experience the depth of London's metaphor, the book should be  read!  It is an excellent way for children to understand that films come  from the written word and to possibly help &quot;turn them on&quot; to  reading.  Additionally, although the story depicts cruelty to animals which  is an important element in London's plot, the film exhibits a large  disclaimer at the beginning of the movie explaining that absolutely no  animals were harmed in the making of the film.  As an avid animal lover and  advocate, I could NOT have viewed nor could I recommend the film if this  had not been done.  However even if the book is not read, this is an  outstanding adventure film suitable for the family.  After viewing, you  might even start a discussion with your children about greed, love and  sacrifice!
