I also have a Logitech M505 and while I was happy with the comfort of M505 mouse, I have to say that M510 is more comfortable because of the bigger full size and better rubber contoured design. If you are looking for more a portable mouse and want smaller size, go with the M505. If you want a larger full size mouse that is more comfortable, go with the M510. As for the appearance of the M510, it is very nice and sleek. Very stylish and doesn't look cheap at all. As for the performance, the cursor control is perfect and precise. Not jittery and not too fast at all. And if you ever did want to adjust cursor speed or adjust buttons, you can by simply downloading a program on their website. I had no need for it though as the mouse worked perfectly for me as is. It also has side scrolling. One feature that I also like is the back and forward button on the side. It is in the right spot and doesn't interfere with my thumb. It also has the unifying receiver which you can connect multiple devices. Some people complained that usb receiver doesn't work with other brands but I think that is common sense and shouldn't expect that. And the setup was easy as I just plugged it and it worked. As for working on various surfaces, it works on many different surfaces. This isn't the more expensive Anywhere Mouse that works on glass or "solid gloss surfaces" but M510 works on the other surfaces like wood grain surface, pants, shirt, couch, mouse pad, etc. People shouldn't complain about its work surface ability because it doesn't have dark field laser and that costs an extra $30. People should realize that THIS MOUSE WAS NEVER MARKETED TO WORK ON GLASS, "MIRROR LIKE" GLOSS SURFACES OR "ANYWHERE". Battery life? It has a great 2 year battery life which is more than my M505 mouse. If it last anywhere close to that, I will be very happy.PROS: wireless, VERY comfortable, great looking mouse, very precise, unifying receiver, works on various surfaces, great connection to receiver, long battery life, great price, 3 YEAR WARRANTY CONS: None so farI give this mouse a 9.5 out of 10.
