The author allows TR to shine through in his own words as well as a generally  sparkling narrative.One fascinating conclusion I drew from the book that  TR was a man who became president about 10 years too early, then became an  old(er) man with his glory days behind him.  The last ten years of his life  were spent twisting at windmills, bullying friend and foe alike while  attempting to regain the power that he willingly gave up after  1909.Nonetheless, the book is a fine testament to TR's immense talents,  ego and passion.  TR was a great man, a great president, but not without  his flaws.
