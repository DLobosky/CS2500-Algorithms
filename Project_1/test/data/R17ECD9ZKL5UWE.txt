Well, An Unlikely Suitor, while a stand-alone title, revolves around the lives of the Scarpelli family - the Italian immigrants who took Lottie in after she was robbed.  This isn't a sequel though.  Lucy and Sofia Scarpelli are two of the three young women who find themselves with unlikely suitors but Lottie and Dora are not involved in this story line - making this a go-along stand-alone novel.Lucy Scarpelli finds herself elevated from her job in a garment sweatshop to that of an assistant in a prestigious dressmaking shop.  When the opportunity arises to help a disfigured, wealthy young woman - Rowena Langdon - with her fashion difficulties she finds herself in an unexpected friendship.This friendship leads to her arrival in Newport - a vacation haven for the wealthy of New York during the Gilded Age.  Needing reinforcements for the commissioning of costumes for a costume ball, Lucy sends for her little sister Sofia and her mother Lea to bring supplies and their able hands.  Soon, Rowena, Lucy, and Sofia find themselves in a tangled web of mystery and unexpected romance that defies the boundaries of class and nationality.Though I found the romantic storylines in An Unlikely Suitor somewhat more realistic than those in Masquerade, there were still issues in this novel for me.  The gap between Protestants and Catholics was not touched upon at all, though this was more often an even greater concern than wealth and class. Lucy's beau behaves in a very questionable manner, and honestly - it was resolved just a bit too easily for me.  I think it would be more realistic to expect trust issues after such a revelation as his.Sofia is only fifteen during the story yet she is sneaking away alone on romantic outings although everyone recognizes that she is not prepared to marry.  I take great issue with this - not only would it be highly inappropriate during the time period depicted but I would also be distraught if my own daughters were behaving in such a way.  This behavior is largely sanctioned and brushed off however, as this fifteen-year-old finds her `soul-mate'.I feel like a nitpicker, but all of these elements really diminished my enjoyment of this novel.  I think I'll pass on Moser's future dress-making/romance type novels and wait for her to dive into another series of loosely related novels before I pick up her writing again.
