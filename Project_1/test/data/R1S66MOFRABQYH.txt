Good little sheet set for the crib, but we switched from crib to twin sized bed so the sheets are too small. The pillowcase and blanket, however, are still very much usable. The kiddo LOVES this blanket, so I wanted to buy another one as a spare (since these loved blankets and stuffed animals get worn out), but had to purchase an entire set to get another blanket. So now I have another set of sheets I cannot use, which is kind of a bummer. Still worth it for the blanket I suppose - our kid takes it EVERYWHERE so we wash them often and rotate them. They've held up pretty darn well with regular abuse.
