After seeing it I was totally amazed at how J.J. Abrams invisioned it, and how the story unfolded. I was very surprised at how the ship was designed, using previous designs,and creating a whole new starship. The bridge also where it was located in this design really threw me. Normally seeing the bridge in the tv series and movies on the top of the saucer, locating it on the bottom was very ingeniuse. I decided to purchase this as one of my very first BLU RAYS discs, and loved watching it again.Paramount has a web site dedicated to Blu Rays. This is where you would register for BD LIVE in order to have access through your Blu Ray player for the added features. After doing some investigating into this site it states that Paramount BD LIVE is only available to US RESIDENTS. Needless to say I contacted my Blu Ray manufacturer they told me to insert an SD CARD into my player. After following my manufactures instructions BD LIVE is working now...!So for those who have bought Paramount movies, and a warning comes up that you have no internet connection is it's because the SD card is required. BD LIVE will work only after you insert an SD CARD, and is available to us Canadians...!
