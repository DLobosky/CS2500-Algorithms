I feel this is a large distraction to what should have been for consise reasoning. What is good about this book is a feel for the time period in which Jesus exsisted, and the author gives very compelling reasoning that most jews could not have even heard of Jesus or his message, but less reject his message. I feel this book along with many of Pagel's books gives a good sense of what the split of christainity and judism were like.   The book is worth reading, but we warned all arguments are not linear, and the reading may take longer than expected.
