Harper is completely different from any other of CH's characters. Harper is dark. But there is a reason for her darkness. Harper was stuck by lightning as a teenager. It stopped her heart. Her step brother Tolliver has to do CPR until an ambulance arrived. When Harper was brought back to life she had a gift. She can feel and hear the dead. Harper can feel where the dead are buried under the ground or where a body is left. She knows what they died from and sees the last few seconds of their life. I love this idea, and I love the mysteries CH creates with Harper's gift.Harper has a terrible childhood. Her Mother and stepfather are drug addicts and do not take care of their children. They live in a trailer, two children from the mother's first marriage, two children from the father's first marriage, and two babies born after the second marriage. Harper, her sister, and her step brothers must take care of the family and sometimes even their parents. Their family is ripped apart when her older sister in kidnapped and never found. The two babies are taken away and Harper and Tolliver are sent away. Tolliver's brother is able to go on his own.Harper and Tolliver have no way to earn an income other than using Harper's gift. They use a Lap Top to get potential customers and word of mouth. People are afraid of Harper, many think she is a fraud and some think she is a witch or physic. Harper and Tolliver travel to a small town in Arkansas to help the police discover how two teenagers died. No one likes the answer. I love the book because I find Harper's gift is exciting to read about. When Harper takes off her shoes and walks barefoot in a grave yard, she knows who is beneath her feet. She feels them. They want to be heard.  Harper speaks for the dead. When she walks in the woods she can feel them under the ground. The long dead reach out to her too. I have read all the reviews posted to date and many people are upset because Harper is not like Sookie. Harper is the opposite of Sookie so don't expect another Sookie novel. People are uncomfortable with Harper's ability with the dead, because she is comfortable with them. Harper doesn't hate the dead, she speaks for them. She gives brokenhearted parents answers and closure. Sometimes when she speaks for the dead, the living don't like the answer. Also Harper is very close with Tolliver. Their parents did marry when Harper and Tolliver were teenagers. They depended on each other to take care of the younger siblings and survive in their dysfunctional family. People see them as brother and sister but they are not. They are not related by blood, only by the marriage of their parents. They are more like close friends with a hint of sexual tension. Harper is very dependent on Tolliver. She is from a train wreak of a family, her sister was kidnapped and missing, and Tolliver is all she has. I did not find this relationship creepy or disturbing. Anyone who had a bad childhood with step-siblings knows strong bonds are formed to survive. CH likes to take us to places where we are not comfortable. And Harper does not make us comfortable in anyway. Harper is a survivor. She communicates with the dead. I don't expect her to be "normal".I would recommend this book to a friend. I enjoyed it and did order the rest of the series.
