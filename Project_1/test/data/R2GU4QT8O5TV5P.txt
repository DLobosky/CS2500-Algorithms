I was hoping to use this device the same way with the added bonus of changing channels and recording to iphone video at the same time etc...First problem I have run into is the ir blaster will not reliably change my directv dvr , it sometimes misses the middle digit , setting it to the slowest setting did not cure the problem , it helps but is not 100%. The other thing is your recordings are in a eyetv wrapper that can be looked at in the show contents of the finder .. your video will be a mpg file... now this is where it gets tricky, the file is not a ts or m2ts file (like the hauppauge) so the ps3 will not play them (it almost works video is jerky) if you feed the file directly to Toast 10 with blu ray plug in it will create a disc without needing to re-encode which is a major time saver but toast will think the filesize is way off and the time of recording will be off if you have edited and compacted the master file , if you tsmux the file toast will then see the proper time of length and not the before edited time of length. Elgato really needs to coordinate with Roxio so your recordings can go straight to hd video without any re-encoding to make it a seemless way to make a disc. I would like to see a TS or m2ts export or record option for those of us who want to make a blu ray with the recording. If all you want to do is record tv and watch it on your screen or iphone/ipad it does pretty much what its suppose to I just wish they would refine the eyetv part to handle options for making avchd discs and fix the ir blaster so its more user programable.. The mpg file it creates is very close to a TS (avchd) type format I just wish they would make it 100% so then you would know what your dealing with. How great would it be to be able to use eyetv to edit or preview your home recordings that were done on a avchd camera with the full ability to burn a blu ray avchd disc in Toast 10 seemlessly.... they're so close but yet so far.....hopefully these little things will be addressed and this thing will be the bomb.UPDATE 11/13/10: Still does not change the channels on directv reliably. The IR blaster is a joke. bottom line is this will NOT change channels with directv worth a damn....UPDATE 3/27/11: Used a product recommended by Brandi called eyechange from cooldvr for $10 to change the channels via ethernet! WORKS great! no more ir blaster!!!
