Unlike anything made by Ubisoft or Unreal (IMHO their games blow), this games smokes all of the competition.Cooperative play is an interesting new feature to the COD series.  You can play in split-screen mode with another player.  Basically, it's solo mode for two (if that makes any sense).  If your comrade is injured, your have to find him and administer first-aid otherwise you both die.  I have 2 HDTVs and 2 PS3s and sprung for a second copy so my son and I can play cooperatively.  It's really cool playing zombie in cooperatiive play.  Oh yeah, don't forget to get your raygun in the second level.  Check youtube for some good glitches -- especially the one on the second floor in zombie mode (bring a flamethrower and an LMG).  Cooperative play on a smaller screens just doesn't work. I completed solo play in Veteran mode and it took about 20 hours.  Yeah, you get killed a lot and it takes forever to complete a mission -- but that's the point.  War isn't running into a room full of enemies and hosing them down with your machine gun without getting a scratch.  It's about tactics, planning and killing the enemy without getting yourself killed.  In Veteran mode, you have no choice other than to plan your moves, use the terrain to your advantage and proceed cautiously.  Simply put; it's hard to survive.  For some reason, I completed a level where you clear out the artillery from the Japanese caves but it doesn't register as a checkpoint so I got stuck and couldn't continue.  If you get stuck like I did the download a saved game from the Internet (for free).Other reviewers said they completed the game in under 10 hours.  I doubt it can be done that quickly unless they're playing at the Rookie level.  No way at Veteran level.There's some cool new fetures too: you can drive and fire a tank, and then there's also a flamethrower.  The tank is OK and the trick is to hang back and take out opponents one at a time -- using the landscape as cover against other tanks.  If you're up to flaming-up the enemy and watching them burn (some burning much more energetically than others), then this is a ton of fun in a sick kind of way.  In story mode, I've done entire levels with only the flamethrower despite its limited range (even though I was packing a LMG too).  This is possible because Activision programmed in a feature that the enemy doesn't shoot at you until you get close when holding the flamethrower.  You can prove this by switching to another weapon and you instantly get shot at.  It's a bunch of fun to burn down trees too.  A word of caution: You can burn yourself up if you walk into the flames.In Veteran story mode, ammo conservation is always an issue.  While your teamates seems to have an unlimited supply of ammo, you don't.  Swapping your weapon for an enemy's drop is an option but not in all cases.  For example, you don't want to drop your sniper rifle for a machine gun.  You're better off locating enemies using the scope and picking them off using a lesser weapon that you have a bunch of ammo for.Online play is good once you level-up to some decent weapons.  Keep in mind this is WWII so there's no lasers, night-vision and barely any scoped weapons.  Automatics are slow and not too accurate.  It takes several body shots to drop a target.  I find myself going for head-shots because a single shot does the job.  There's a new level called Bootcamp that you can play until Level 8.  There's a glitch that you can exploit to level-up more quickly.  Once you're in Bootcamp you can stay there indefinately as long as you don't leave.  In other words, you can level up to 44 in about 8 hours in Bootcamp.This game is rated M for Mature.  The rating is justified because there is some pretty graphic material and language.  For example, when you step on a land mine your legs get blown off.  This is way more intense than COD4.
