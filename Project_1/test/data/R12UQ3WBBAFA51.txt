The only complaint I have about this DVD (and that for Season 2) is the lack of playtome of its great theme song: "The Ballad of Paladin."  The theme song only played once or twice on each disc.  Why kimp on such a great theme song.  After all, the duration of the song was only about 30 seconds.  In any event, this is a great DVD and I highly recommend it!  (Washington, D.C. Area).
