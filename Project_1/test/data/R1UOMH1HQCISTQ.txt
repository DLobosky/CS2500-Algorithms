I've been using just one or two drops (which I smooth over my palms) to add some shine to my hair when it's dry.  It imparts a really nice shine, and, as long as I stay away from my roots, my hair doesn't look greasy.  I haven't used this yet as a hot oil treatment, but will update my review after I've done so.
