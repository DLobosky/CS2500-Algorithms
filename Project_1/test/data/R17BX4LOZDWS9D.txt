I think this is the best of the Tracy-Hepburn films.  It was also the first.  It revived their fledgling careers and made them fresh and fun.  It is a very romantic film about a woman who acts like a "man" - callous, indifferent, busy away from home, neglectful to her spouse, while the husband, a sports writer, is forced into the woman's role of waiting at home constantly for a spouse who is away, dependent on her attention and lonely most of the time.  A wonderful insightful story about the sexes.
