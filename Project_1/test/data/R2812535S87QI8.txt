But, I just couldn't resist adding this to my Listmania list of "my favorite movies"!!!I experienced my "teen years" during the mid 1980's, so of course I saw EVERY ONE of the Molly Ringwald movies when they came out - and I LOVED every single one!!!I often wonder what ever became of her - as she had quite a string of hit movies, and then just disappeared from the radar.  I honestly hope to see her again some day, as I always thought she was a really good actress...Anyway, "Pretty in Pink" is about a teenage girl living during the 1980's (you can tell by the "great" style of clothes) on the "wrong side of the tracks".  She lived with her father, who simply did not like to work, as her mother had left them some years earlier.She spends most of her time with her best friend "Ducky" - who's a really great guy, also from a "working class" family.  However, there are 2 REALLY rich, good looking guys who seem to be interested in her.  1 of them is a MAJOR jerk, and all he ever cares about is "one thing" (I'm sure you know what I mean), so she consistently turns him down - which makes him EXTREMELY "pissed off".  The 2nd guy seems to be a pretty nice guy, and she becomes enamored of him.Well, the "nice guy" finally asks her out & she says yes - only to be treated like trash by his friends.  But, they try to continue dating & he eventually asks her to the prom - & she says yes.Will he show up?  Will she be forced to go alone?  Who will she end up with - Ducky or the rich guy???  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you never saw the movie, but suffice it to say that you will ALWAYS remember the ending to this movie!!! (I don't know of anyone who doesn't, and many of them last saw it about 20 years ago!!!).I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies in general, or the Molly Ringwald gang in particular.  This is a great movie, and much of it will still make sense to today's teens.  In fact, if you grew up in the 80's, your kids might be around that age now, so you could watch it together - a family movie night...
