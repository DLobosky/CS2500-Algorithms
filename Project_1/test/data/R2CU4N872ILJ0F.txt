At any given time there are probably close to a dozen different options, and that alone gives this game a 4-star rating.Far Cry 2 was built to have a lot of realism.  This is both good and bad.  The ease and ability of creating brush fires is ridiculously fun, and eerily scary at the same time.  The same fire you set to wipe out baddies can end up cornering you between a rock and a hot place.  Guns will jam on you when you least expect it, which can make for some awfully panicky game play.  There is no radar, and there is no pandering.  If you hit a guy with a truck, he dies.  If they hit you, YOU die.  I took a headshot during a gun battle.  I know it was a headshot - I went from full health to falling to the ground.  Luckily a buddy "saved me," relieving my need for a reload.And that's the basis of Far Cry 2.  There's a LOT of challenges in the game, from jamming weapons, to the need for Malaria medicine, to frequent and recurrent gun battles all over the map.  But you can PREVENT a lot of these from becoming issues if you prepare yourself.Tired of guns jamming?  Stop by the gun shop and buy a new one.  Or at least pick up a new one if you've already purchased it - brand new guns are available (once purchased) in every segment of the map.Malaria medicine?  Not that much of a problem, really - I got the first bottle and haven't run out yet.  It'd be nice if they gave us a quantity left, so that I could know how long until I need some.  I'll admit it's a useless addition to the game, but again, it hasn't really posed much of a problem.Tired of fighting the same battle in the same place?  Once you've scouted a guard post, just barrell through in your truck of choice, or go crashing through the jungle to avoid the battle entirely.  I've avoided many confrontations this way.  Also, ride the rails whenever possible - very few areas of hostility along the train tracks.If you're expecting a gunfight (which you should ALWAYS be expecting,) make sure your female "buddy" is ready to save you.  You only get one save, then you have to stop any any pre-established safe house to "reset" her - then she'll be ready to save you again.The graphics of FC2 are amazing - simply amazing.  You can actually start to recognize where you are - it's not like the city sand-box games where it all just blends together.  There's dizzying heights and deep rivers.  I really like how long a day lasts - games like Grand Theft Auto run through a game-day in about an hour.  FC2's game-days run about 4 hours, maybe even more.  It really lets you plan your strategy and never makes you feel rushed.I get irritated by a few things, like how a civilian drives past me and feels compelled to jump out of his car and open fire on me.  Or how guns you're carrying seem to just dissapear...  Turns out if they jam and you don't hit the unjam button, he'll just throw them away.When a first-person shooter can keep you entertained for 30+ hours, that's a feat.  Few games can pull that off.  Yeah it's not a perfect game, but there's a lot to do here if you understand the intended strategy.  I've actually enjoyed playing Far Cry 2, and I have already found myself aiming for various "completionist" achievements because once you get past the challenges, there's a pretty fun game inside.
