It's filled with action, adventure, and incredibly mature story lines that deal with oppression, isolation, and prejudice that made the X-Men Comic books so popular. You almost forget that you're watching a cartoon made for a younger audience.X-MEN VOL. 2... continues the cliffhanger from X-Men, Volume 1 (Marvel DVD Comic Book Collection) and ends with the five-part "The Phoenix Saga." The stories follow the comic books pretty closely and show some origin stories like "A Rogue's Tale" that shows how Rogue got her powers. "The Phoenix Saga" follows the comic (if you want to read the original check out X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga) and I enjoyed all of the episodes except "Mojovision," the last episode on DVD 1.I also noticed that some of the villains in this volume also make their appearance in these two "X-Men" games X-Men Legends II Rise of the Apocalypse and Marvel Ultimate Alliance, so check those out if you don't have them already.There are no extras on this DVD set and you have the option to "play-all" or "episode selection." I read that some reviewers have said that these are edited from the original broadcast showings. I'm not sure about that and like I said for X-MEN VOL. 1, if these episodes are edited, I can't tell the difference since I don't find any continuity errors.This volume concludes season 2 and although the last episode isn't necessarily a cliffhanger, you can't help but wonder what's going to happen next. Can't wait for the remaining seasons!
