However, I've never been the National, and I've spent no more than an hour total watching the Masters on TV.But I've played countless rounds of golf on computers, dating back to the original "Microsoft Golf" that came included on our 166 megahertz PC in 1996.Tiger Woods 09 is the culmination of countless "greats."  The stick swing - a method entirely new to me in the 2008 game - was incredibly cumbersome in Woods 08.  I could never figure out what the game wanted me to do, so I skipped the method altogether in favor of the 3-click method.With the inclusion of the real-time monitor - a picture of a golf ball with a yellow line that draws your stroke path, as well as arrows at the top and bottom of the ball showing your precise alignment - accurate swings are easier than ever.If you're still having a hard time, you can go to the Club Tuner - a remarkably easy-to-use interface that allows you to adjust everything from power, loft, workability (amount of possible "curve," left to right,) spin, and more.  Of course you trade in the increase of these attributes at the loss of sweet spot - the amount of "fudging" allowed when you swing.The graphics are simply dazzling.  The water areas are just beautiful.  Trees have a nice three dimensional look to them.  Everything is just very nice.  Even the menus and scorecards are nice and clean.The newest inclusion is that of simultaneous multiplay online - a feature I actually got to try myself.  It makes for a game that's actually faster than singleplay because it skips the flybys and such.  The only thing I don't like is the shot clock, limiting players to no more than 60 seconds per shot.  This is golf - it's not supposed to be a race.  I realize the pros probably play against a shot clock, but we're not the pros.  Still, at 60 seconds, you have plenty of time to aim, analyze the course and make your swing.There are tons of ways to customize your character.  Even without using the Game Face feature (yet,) I was still able to create a golfer with a striking likeness to myself.  I just wish there were a few more facial hair features - I can't replicate my goatee.  The only bummer I still feel is that they give you a wide range of clothing to wear, but certain pieces have certain attribute increases.  This is nice, but if you want to dress your character a certain way (I REALLY like black polos!) you're either stuck with the attributes that those clothes boost - even if they're not what you want - or you're stuck wearing non-flattering outfits in the interest of getting the desired boosts.  It obviously doesn't hurt the game, but why can't you just let me change colors?Lastly, the greatest feature in my opinion is the ability to switch between the analog-stick swing and the 3-click swing with the click of a button, mid-play.  This allows you to make drives with ease and the realistic feel of golf, but switch to a 3-click for those challenging putts.  Unfortunately, the 3-click is not available in the Hard difficulty setting, which is what I wanted to play with.  I don't understand why - the 3-click has it's own challenges.  Why can't it be included in Hard play?  Using the stick-swing to dial in 62% power is nearly impossible.But all issues aside, Tiger 09 is a fantastic game that rewards golf enthusiasts of all ages and skill.  The Gamernet feature from EA is very inobtrusive and gives players the chance to challenge themselves just that little bit extra, if desired.  Challenges may pop up to drive further than another player, land within a distance of the pin, etc.  You can also go online just with the purpose of taking on various challenges - some of which are quite difficult!  It's amazing how many different ways of enjoying Golf this game gives you.Makes me want to go get a set of clubs and hit up a local course.  Maybe I will...
