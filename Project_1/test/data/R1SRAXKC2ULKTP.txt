I did not try putting it in any of the other cracks in the dash but it looks too thick to me. I got this in the slot and tightened the nylon/plastic bolt and popped my iphone and and was very happy with it. It tilts and swivels in every direction by a little (enough for my purposes) and it is easy to tilt yet it stays in place. However, when adjusting it on the 3rd time I used it the mount had worked its way out of the CD slot. I was not pulling on it that hard or anything so I was surprised. I tightened it more but think I am at the limits as some plastic started to strip from the bolt (I think see photos) and the top and bottom halves of the wedge look like they are coming apart a bit.  At this tightness I am sure I could still pull it out but I am not going to try because I feel I may have worn the threads to the point that I will not be able to reset it a 2nd time. Now when I adgust the tilt I push in as I do it just to make sure it won't work its way out. It has minor wobbles on an average road but I am happy with the stability I just don't have a lot of confidence that I can take it out and put it back often (i.e. if you wanted to use it in different cars or wanted to move it to use the CD player which I never will)). I think I have a pretty standard CD slot so I am a little disappointed that it is not better suited to it. Also the bottom support snaps off in a way that makes me feel like I am breaking it. It is really shallow and phones in cases won't sit on there so well and in fact it will block the dock connector if the phone were resting on it. Fortunately this is not needed- the side clamps hold the phone very securely. The bottom support is nice for keeping the connector handy but still not necessary. I do find the button you squeeze to release the phone a bit hard to reach while the phone is in there (and this is another time I have to be careful not to put any outward pressure on the mount that might make it come out of the slot again.) I am kinda short though so maybe it is just me...I have never tried any of the suction mounts at least not since my first ipod, but I will never trust them to stay on and allow me to interact with a touch screen which this mount does do. SO it has a few flaws but think it is on of the better ones out there in this price range.
