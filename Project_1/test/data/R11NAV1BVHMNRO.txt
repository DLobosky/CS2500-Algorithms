I swear my life's quest has been finding a pair of suitable headphones/earphones to excercise in. I saw these and I thought...oh SONY! Perfect. Except no. The entire time I ran/moved I spent with my hand on my ear to ensure the bud wouldn't fall out. They were so bad. This is probably my 8th pair this year. Maybe one day I will find some headphones....
