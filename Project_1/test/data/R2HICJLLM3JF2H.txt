Initially, this book looked interesting, chock-full of historical details, with pamphlets on different devotions enclosed. But the content betrays, muffled in semantics by a linguist. There's no mention of the luminous mysteries added by Pope John Paul II; later editions could have been amended to include them. You would not believe the time the author spent raving in an inappropriate diatribe against sports in the Agony in the Garden mystery. Who cares what Johnson's issues are regarding sports? As an athletic person, I couldn't care less, and as a researcher, I want to be provided real information, not nonsensical opinion. I highly recommend the fun and lucid The Rosary Handbook: A Guide for Newcomers, Old-Timers, and Those in Between instead.In trepidation, I turned to the Crucifixion mystery, to see if the author stains this mystery too. He does, in the most peculiar way. He horrifically describes Third Reich torture in great detail, sagging skin and all, never mentioning that Jews were the victims involved. A person of real faith does not need to dwell on gore to meditate on the depth of this mystery. As many fine theologians point out, Judaism the root of Christian faith. But Johnson completely gets Jewish history wrong, dismissing two thousand years of Judaism after the final destruction of the Temple. It's a miracle that the Jews, the people of the First Covenant, the brethren of Jesus, have miraculously survived. In the history of the world, no other people kept their language, religion, and heritage alive, while suffering over two thousand years of exile and persecution. Johnson completely misrepresents the truth when he declares that the Sadducees were the seeds for modern Judaism; they did not follow the Talmud as well as the Torah, modern Judaism does both. The Sadducees were lost in history. Unbelievable misinformation; it's incomprehensible that Johnson could write beautifully about some aspects of prayer, yet hatefully in other regards, even lambasting sports. On page 305, Johnson wrote that the Jewish Apostles saw "the whole nation of Israel turn into a mob that compelled the Roman governor to crucify Christ." This kind of generalization caused Christian mob violence against Jews over the centuries; only a raving anti-Semite would write such bile. Devout Catholics avoid this kind of thinking, it would be like shooting yourself in the proverbial foot, or root. For the mystery of Pentecost, Johnson makes the common mistake of assuming Jews called this holiday Pentecost too. They never did in Israel, and they don't two thousand years later. This Jewish feast of first-harvest is Shavout, celebrated fifty days after the festival of Passover. It is utter nonsense to state that, "because this holiday didn't have a descriptive name rooted in Hebrew like the others, and because by the time of Christ so many people spoke Greek, the holiday came to be called simply the Fiftieth Day - Pentecost" (326). Jesus spoke Aramaic, not Greek, and in referring to this feast, he would have used the normative Hebrew term - Shavout. There are better resources out there. This travesty will be discarded. Try this fine book: The New Rosary in Scripture: Biblical Insights for Praying the 20 Mysteries, which contains Pope John Paul II's "The Rosarium Virginis Mariae: Apostolic Letter on the Most Holy Rosary."
