I suppose when you start out with a tsunami and drop down to private experiences with death, you go from shock to flat.  The only real highlight in the midst of it was the near miss with death of the surviving twin, Marcus.
 
 The acting was quite good.  I was especially impressed with Marcus, whose twin was killed in an accident, and his mother, whose personal problems had reduced the family to a shambles.  The acting here was intense and very real.
 
 In all, the film had the feeling of an assembly line process.  Everyone did their bit on their own home turf according to availability, and the featured actors met on common ground for the d&eacute;nouement.   No fuss, no muss, no bother.  Sometimes that works really well.  Richard Curtis, Love Actually (Widescreen Edition), has used a similar format with great success. Given the renown and ability of the director and producer here (Eastwood and Spielburg), I expected more.  It just didn't work for me this time.
