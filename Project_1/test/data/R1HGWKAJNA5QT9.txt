An atomic clock (or watch) is a clock that sets its time automatically by monitoring the WWVB clock signal transmitted by the NIST atomic clock in Fort Collins, Colorado. In other words, a true atomic clock/radio would never need setting, would never need to be adjusted for daylight savings time, and would always display the accurate time.The Emerson CKS3029 Clock Radio is a regular clock radio with a battery-backed up memory. When you unplug the clock (or when there's a power outage), the battery keeps the clock portion powered (there's no display). When power is restored, the time is "reprogrammed" by the internal clock. Once the internal battery dies (it supposedly lasts 3-5 years) and there is a power outage, the clock will lose its settings and must be manually set!Unlike other non-atomic clock radios (the GE 74894 comes to mind), this one DOES self-adjust for daylight savings time and leap years which is nice.The clock radio seems to be very well made and has some really nice features including a display dimmer, weekend and/or non-weekend alarms (dual alarms), a nice large snooze button, and day-of-week indicators. The radio sounds a bit "tinny" and cheap, but this is a clock radio and not a boombox.In summary, if you're looking for a genuine atomic clock radio, steer clear of this product. If you're looking for a clock radio that can ride out power outages without losing track of the time, and a radio with lots of nice features, then I'd recommend this one.
