This is a mystery that fans of G.K. Chesterton will especially enjoy. The story revolves around the discovery at Notre Dame University of an unpublished Father Brown story. References to Chesterton abound, and  there's lots of GKC trivia that will appeal to Chestertonians. All this,  combined with Ralph McInerny's usual satirical wit, makes for very  entertaining reading. And the professor-detective Roger Knight is an  unusual, likable and winsome character.
