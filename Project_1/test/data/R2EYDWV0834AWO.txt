Also,like the other sets,the booklet is informative-both on this particular club/area in England and the era of the mid-seventies,when N.S. was at it's peak in popularity.  There's info on each track,an overview of the era,color photographs of 45 labels,and photos of some of the artists and reproductions of ads for all night events.This is another fine collection of up-beat soul recorded in the late sixties/early seventies.  If this style of music is your cup of tea (no pun intended) this would make a nice addition to your collection.  As usual,the artists are both well known (VAN MCCOY,THE TRAMMPS,EARTH,WIND AND FIRE as examples) and artists who never really made it far in the music world.  No matter,as is typical of N.S. the music is uniformly good,usually up-tempo,and taken together,good for either listening or dancing.  This genre had it's beginnings in England,where kids would gather from far and wide,and swap,buy,dance or listen to some great soul music on vinyl 45's.  The DJ would spin hits and rarities all night,and for a number of years these gatherings were extremely popular.  Paul Weller (THE JAM,solo artist) among many other artists of that era were heavily influenced by N.S.  This volume will give the listener insight into what all the fuss was about.  This is good,important music that more people should know about.  Give it a listen.
