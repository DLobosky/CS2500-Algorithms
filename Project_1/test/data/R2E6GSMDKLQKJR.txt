I also have a deep interest in the mind-body connection and human sexuality as an integrating force.  In my practice, I see a lot of the fallout from ignorance, acting out and shame, which is what has largely prompted me to write this review.I initially encountered Jack Morin through his book The Erotic Mind: Unlocking the Inner Sources of Passion and Fulfillment.  In my opinion, it is the hands down best book on understanding human sexual fantasy, how this operates in everyday life, etc.  My second favorite that talk about evolutionary programming is The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating.  Armed with these two books you can get a deep and wide perspective on sexuality with a small investment of time.  If I could, I would make them required reading for anyone with a sex drive!!After reading THE EROTIC MIND, I looked for other books by Jack Morin and discovered this one.  I was surprised he wrote a book on anal pleasure and health given his specialty in psychology.  I didn't expect much when the book arrived, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a well-researched, broad spectrum treatment of anal eroticsm in all it's aspects.  It includes information on physiology, health risks, various practices, "how to" tips, etc.It is obvious according to research that many heterosexual as well as gay couples explore this territory.  It is also a fact that it can be quite pleasurable for many people, but yet there is still a lot of shame sorrounding it.  I see this book as a big step forward in getting these discussions inquiries out into the public eye.  Young people are going to experiment, long-term couples are going to try new things and some people are going to participate in anal eroticism as their main sexual event.  Given this sexual landscape, this book can help people to stay safe, maximize their pleasure and understand the risks involved in this type of sexual play.I know there are many books on this topic written from many angles, however, I haven't seen one as multi-dimensional and concise as this.  There is no hype here, just a dense collection of practical no nonsense information.  If you are curious about exploring this area with your partner or you have a partner that is reluctant to try it, you may want to read this book together.I would like to mention that although the book is dense with content, it is easily readable by anyone.  It is not difficult, too technical, too clinical or filled with assertions that are not supported by research or expert opinion.I understand that there are some people who object to anal sex on moral grounds and I understand that.  However, whether any group or individual thinks it's right or wrong, I don't think people should be hurt, put themselves needlessly in harms way, etc.  Personally, I don't think there is anything wrong with anal sex.  In general, I think the intention behind any act is what largely makes it positive or negative.  I have also found that no two things on the planet backfire more than guilt and sex in the sexual arena.  I talk to many hurt people who have acted out or hurt others through the inappropriate expression of their sexuality because of these two emotional demons.  That is not to say that I think anything goes, just that guilt and shame usually perpetuate that which they are trying to prevent.  Two good books that I really like that talk more about this area are:  Women, Sex, and Addiction: A Search for Love and Power, Private Lies: Infidelity and Betrayal of Intimacy and Don't Call It Love: Recovery From Sexual Addiction.There is no reason that any play can't be safe and fun.  This book will help you to understand how to do it and do it right.  If you thought you could never have anal intercourse, this book will give you all the information you need to learn how quickly and safely.
