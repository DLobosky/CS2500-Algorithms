Jacques Cousteau was a fearless underwater pioneer who invented SCUBA gear, underwater living structures, underwater camera gear, and opened up the "silent world" to viewers everywhere. This picture book biography, which actually would please even high school readers, offers glimpses into his life, his courage, his passion for conservation. It includes a short index, glossary, even a recipe at the end, but no internet resources for the Cousteau Society or other affiliations that mark Cousteau's profound effect on the world after his many years of research and invention. It is part of a series, "In the Footsteps of Explorers" which kids would love. It is this reviewer's fondest hope that teachers in upper grades would let go of arbitrary page count requirements for book reports and encourage exploratory reading and reporting by older students using materials such as this fine, well illustrated book.
