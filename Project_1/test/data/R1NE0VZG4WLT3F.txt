And most poor fans of Lucille Ball will be starving to death.  I still have this and it's counterpart on tape.  May buy it on disc soon, as it is one of my favorites (Rosalind Russell Rules).  But who was the nutcase who included the trailer for the musical from 1974, without releasing a DVD of the musical?  Oh well, I guess we buy this one now, and will get the musical next year.  Wait, it IS next year.  Come on Warner release the other one too.:-)
