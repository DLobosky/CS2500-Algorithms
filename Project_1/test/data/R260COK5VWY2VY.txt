This movie is soo awesome!! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are really good together. When the Pirate skelotons come on it's like a thrill ride. I took my 8 year old brother two see it and he loved it, it is deffinetly a movie for all ages, and it makes being a pirate sound like soo much fun! If you havn't seen it you really really should!
