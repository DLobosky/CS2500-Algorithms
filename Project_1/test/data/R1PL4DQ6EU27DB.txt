I never really used my iPhone pair because they would always fall out and after a few hours they became uncomfortable.A few months ago when my wife's iPhone ear buds decided to finally quit I did some research and recommended this pair to her. Since then she's raved about them.Recently, I had the need for headphones on a trip and I decided to borrow her pair. I was surprised to find that the ear buds fit nicely into my ears and did not fall out. I immediately became enamored and decided to order myself a pair. Here are a few pros and cons on the ear buds after using these for a few months now.=================PROS =================+ These are only slightly more expensive than the initial model that comes with the iPhone (Apple Earphones with Remote & Mic).+ The "mushroom" covers for the ear buds make it easy to find a good fit for your ear.+ The cord is made out of a shoelace-like material, which is a nice upgrade over the cheap feel of the standard iPhone pair. Also, I have not had any problems with the cord getting tangled.+ The storage case that comes with the ear buds is a nice touch.+ The multi-function button on the mic replaces all (e.g. pause, play, answer, hang up) the same features as the iPhone pair you get out of the box.+ Noise canceling works very well to block out all external noise while on a call or listening to music.+ The fit of the ear bud is very snug without being uncomfortable. I've fallen asleep with the ear buds in place and woken up with them still in place without any discomfort.+ Very clear sound quality.=================CONS=================- I can see the noise canceling being a problem for some people because when talking your end of a conversation seems much louder. I've adjusted by keeping only the right ear bud in when making calls.- The sound quality is good, but I feel like it lacks some depth to the bass that I've seen in other ear buds. Then again those ear buds are much more expensive and the quality of the sound is still an improvement over the standard iPhone pair.Overall this is a great pair of ear buds and I would recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade the standard pair supplied by Apple. I would also recommend these to anyone with smaller ears that have had a hard time using ear buds in the past. There are ear buds with better sound, but for overall features look no further.
