I've had a pair of Channellock 420's in my hand almost every work day since 1992.  They are hands-down the best tongue and groove plier on the market.  No one makes a hinge that lasts longer.  Their hinge pin is pressed together which is vastly superior to a crushed nut so many other pliers have.  If you purchase a set of pliers (for heavy daily, not casual, use) from ANY manufacturer and there is a nut holding on the hinge pin...you should save yourself a lot of time and go ahead and loosen the nut, pinch your finger inbetween the handles, scream obscenities at whoever is unlucky enough to be standing nearby, and then throw the tool as far as you can...because that is what will eventual happen if you decide to save a few bucks on a pair of pliers with a nut on the hinge pin.If you have ever used another brand for a period of time you will notice the quality as soon as you hold them.
