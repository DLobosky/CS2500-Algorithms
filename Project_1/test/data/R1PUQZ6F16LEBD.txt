I read this because I had seen many referrals to this book from other reviews.  The craze right now is YA Paranormal Romance type of books.  I always check reviews before buying a book.  I liked the description of the story and this book was priced just right.  I had many pros and cons...Pros:  I liked that the main character whose point of view we saw the story from was a boy.  Ethan Wate.  He seemed like the perfect hero.  Very sweet, I didn't get much info on his looks so I could imagine him the way I wanted.  The gothic girl who was his love interest was a fun character and I enjoyed reading about her wardrobe as well as all of her powers.  These were unique in comparison to most of the other paranormal stuff I have been reading.  Her feelings for him seemed real but distant.  Link, Amma, Ridley, and Macon really helped make the reading more enjoyable, they were fun characters to read about.  I liked the Kelting and the dreams, I really enjoyed the way this paranormal was different from any other I've read which is why I decided to read it in the first place.Cons: I was not a huge fan of the dialogue.  I did not like how some of the characters had thick southern accents and others sounded just normal.  It was confusing and made it more difficult to read.I liked it enough to read the next one.  I always finish a series and plan on continuing on, hoping to see some more depth to the characters.  I am very fond of the main character.  I would love to learn more about him, and find some more depth in the characters.  I would like to see into their backgrounds and find out who they are what is in store for their futures.  I'm guessing something surprising since this isn't your typical YA book.  Check it out if you are tired of reading the same plot over and over again.
