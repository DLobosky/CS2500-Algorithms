There are five, tab-delineated sections, as follows:(1) Book Register. Very attractively designed pages with the following fields: Title, Author, Published, Began Reading...Finished, Notes, Recommended to or Lent to, Rated. This is by far the most helpful section of the book, and the longest, but it is not long enough.(2) Books to read. 28 pages with room for one recommended book per page. A lot  of room for comments on the book, but how many comments will one have for a book one hasn't yet read? Lots of wasted space here that would be better spent on section one.(3) Reading group notes. Three pages for names and phone numbers, then just under twenty two-page entries for individual books. If you're not in a book group, you're out of luck.(4) Book stores and services. An address book, with room for three entries per page, and 18 pages long. Who's going to have 54 bookstores they need to keep information for? This is a ridiculous use of space.(5) Passages. Blank, lined pages for recording favorite passages. This is an okay section.The ideal book would be a combination of this and A Book Lover's Journal. The layout of Reader's Journal is nicer, and it's spiral bound, but so much space is wasted on stupid things that I don't think I'll be using it. A pity. It's an attractive little book.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
