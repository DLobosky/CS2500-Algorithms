BBRUS should carry it in the store, not just on line! Other covers (GRACO, ESP. Baby, etc..) are thinner & made from all clear plastic. They are also much shorter all around & tend to be stiffer - they just don't provide enough coverage (despite what the picture on the cover shows). This cover also folds neatly into a small pouch which can easily be stored in the stroller basket or hung from the handle for unexpected usage.I've also used it on a number of different stroller types and it is always a perfect fit! My friends all love it and people stop to ask me where I purchased it almost every time I use it!. One of the best stroller accessories I've ever purchased and the only cover I would ever use!I recently purchased the new Protect-a-Bub Snuggle Bub Stroller insert from the company site(their version of a Bundle Me Big) -they should carry it at BBRUS! This is the best stroller insert for cold weather I have tried (even better than Bundle Me Big and One Step Ahead Toddler Snuggly). It is made from natural lamb's wool (so it "breathes"), machine washable (air dry), and very roomy so it will last a long time (up to age 4 years, depending on the size of your child)!
