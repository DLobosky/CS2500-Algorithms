While watching the massive collection of animated picture books in the Treasury of 100 Storybook Classics two new, particular favorites emerged, Doreen Cronin's Click, Clack, Moo and her Diary of a Spider.Needless to say, when a new disc in the series was released containing only Cronin's stories, we were excited! Giggle, Giggle, Quack contains five full Cronin picture books as adapted for DVD: Giggle, Giggle, Quack: Dooby, Dooby, Moo: Duck for President: Diary of a Worm: and Diary of a Fly.Like the other titles in the series, each includes the optional read-along feature that highlights words as they are narrated on the DVD, and easy to use story selection navigation, or the option to play all. Additional features include a Spanish version of Giggle, Giggle, Quack, and Duck for President - complete with optional Spanish read-along, an interview with Harry Bliss, illustration of Cronin's Diary of a... titles, and simple discussion questions for each title. Each of the main titles is between 10 and 15 minutes in length, for a total viewing time of around one hour. When you add in the extras, you have 84 minutes of storybook goodness.Giggle, Giggle, Quack has also appeared as the lead title on Giggle, Giggle, Quack... and More Funny Favorites, and the two sport nearly identical covers (one green, this one blue), so if you're looking for the `all-Cronin' title, you'll want to look for the blue cover.Cronin hasn't disappointed us. Her Farmer Brown stories in the vein ofClick, Clack, Moo are delightful forays into the inexplicable world of ducks who write, sing, and campaign for president (not to mention the other farm animals!) Her continued exploration of the up-close and personal lives of insects blends common childhood experiences with playfully related information about insect habits, anatomy, life cycles, and much more!Giggle, Giggle, Quack is most certainly one of my girls' favorite DVDs from the Scholastic Storybook Treasures DVD collection. Cheerful, fun, and sneakily educational, boys and girls alike will delight in the antics of Cronin's creatures while being immersed in a language-rich environment courtesy of the read along subtitling. My children are giving it six fingers up!
