Hemingway had worked on the manuscript for several years, tentatively titling it "Air, Land and Sea", as he wanted to incorporate his many travels and his love of sport fishing- as well as his fascination with war and death- into a massive work which might someday become his magnum opus. Because Hemingway's star began to fade with some critics in the literary crowd in the 1970's, "Islands in the Stream" got at best mixed reviews. However, anyone who wants to see the mature Hemingway, describing his love of his children, his favorite hobbies (sailing and fishing) and even enjoy rare humor from this author will truly enjoy this great book.The novel highlights the main character- Thomas Hudson- this time an artist- who lives on an island in the Caribbean and rarely spends time with his sons- but welcomes them when he sees them....and enjoys a special time out on the open seas trying to catch a huge fish....These scenes are wonderfully portrayed and we see a side of Hemingway we rarely see...Another major focus of the book is the hunt for Germans who have invaded a nearby island during World War II...and we see Hemingway at his daring best....with intrigue right to the very last page of the novel...."Islands in the Stream" is a superb book- my favorite book by Hemingway....It ranks with his very best works...and I hope that readers around the world who are new to Hemingway- or have only read his "best sellers"- will pick this one up and enjoy it as well...It is worth the read....and stands as his crowning achievement, which was completed by his wife after his death. He would be proud....-Gene PisasaleAuthor of "Vineyard Days"
