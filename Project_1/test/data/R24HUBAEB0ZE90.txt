I'm amazed that I can go to the Asahi Shinbum newspaper for the best online interactive kanji drill practice available at any cost. It is free if you have a computer and Internet connection. It was my primary study guide for the Japanese writing system. The 5000 FREE SAT vocabulary was the way I studied for the GRE and my score surprised me and got me into grad school.Still, this book gives a full historical, economic, sociological, and even psychological view of the price, Free.  It's a captivating read. It is doubly amazing because I consumed it as audiobook which was a free download from Amazon's younger brother, Audible.  The book itself reinforces the concept he explains. Moreover, Chris's clear enthusiasm comes through in his narration of the book.  It's a great concept and an even better audio book.Well done!
