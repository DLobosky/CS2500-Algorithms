"Too many words."  (Kinda reminds you of Armadeus.)  There are plenty of books that have the math.  These books offer insight -- something that is hard to come by in formal physics education.Others have correctly noted that these books are not necessarily good stand-alone templates for courses.  They don't always take the normal approach of starting at the simplest mathematical formalism and building on it.  In fact, Volume 2 starts off Electricity and Magnetism with Maxwell's Equations -- stated qualitatively.  He then works through the EM course, showing as he goes along that the various mathematical approaches to E&M topics represent different instantiations of the equations.  The normal undergraduate text approach is to finish at Maxwell's Equations after covering all the lower-level, more specific material.  Feynman wanted to do something original with these books.  He succeeded, but it took him far enough off the beaten path that very few will try to use them as stand-alone texts.  If I were going to teach undergrad E&M, I'd consider it too risky to attempt to use Volume 2 as my standalone text.  Instead, I'd use it as an overlay on a more classical path.I believe that Feynmann started with the way that he had learned to think about physics.  It was what had worked for him.  Then he set out to teach others how to think the same way.  One reviewer has said that everybody is different, and the reviewer is right.  All great physicists haven't thought like Feynmann:  in fact Feynmann was an eccentric to say the least as the book by Gleick aptly shows.  I personally do believe it is worth every physicist's while to take the time to understand Feynmann's approach.    The introductory material in Volume 1 is highly quotable.  You can get your money's worth right there.When I started Volume 2, I'd had undergraduate electricity and magnetism and found it dry and boring the first time around.  After Volume 2, I was so pumped, I wanted to teach the subject then and there.I read Volume 3 when I was starting graduate quantum mechanics. My first final exam was oral, two-on-one.  The professor had a second prof sit in with him to quiz each student.  They opened with a few questions on the uncertainty principle.  I started rattling off some of the insights I'd gotten from Volume 3.  These guys must not have read it, because they were blown away.  They'd ask a question and I'd answer and then follow with a hook to keep them coming back.  I spent an hour of the two-hour exam on the uncertainty principle!  Talk about getting off on the right foot with a new prof! These books have been an inspiration to me for the last 40 years.  Whether you're a student or a Ph.D. -- and especially if you teach at any level -- you must not be without them.    They will improve your understanding of physics, and they'll equip you to better communicate it. So what level are they pitched at?  They were originally written for freshmen and sophmores at Cal Tech.  The assumption was that the students would be starting calculus when they started the books.  It will take an exceptional freshman or sophmore to handle all of what's here.  Freshmen or sophmores will get a lot of useful perspectives from the books, but they will be challenged  if they just plow straight through them.  They can be useful at times as reference books, but not always.  In many cases, the reader's knowledge is assumed to have been built up in the Feynmann mold.  The good news is that any physicist at any level SHOULD read them eventually.  Freshmen might consider starting with Feynman's Six Easy Pieces to get their feet wet.  The first 15 or so pages of Volume I should be appreciated by anyone. I realize that I've sounded a little over-the-top in this review.  If I said less, I'd be understating my honest opinion. Tim Naff, Ph.D.
