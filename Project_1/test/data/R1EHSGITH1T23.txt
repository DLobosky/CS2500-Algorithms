It will no doubt be a classic for my kids. Unfortunately, the other books in the "Fancy Nancy" series don't compare. When we read Explorer Extraordinaire, I had to look at the front to see if it was even the same author. We've gone through a few other titles as well, but none of the others have the same magic as the original.I highly recommend the original work, but this particular book leave much to be desired!
