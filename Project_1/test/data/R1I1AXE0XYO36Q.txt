I enjoy a good murder mystery of the classical type, and the Brother Cadfael series is particularly good.  The author Ellis Peters (Edith Pargiter, 1913-1995), like Agatha Christie, Nagio Marsh and Dorothy Sayers, was popular during the mid-20th Century and wrote prolifically during that time.  There are some 20 Cadfael books.  The film One Corpse Too Many, based  upon the book of the same name, was the first one I saw on Public TV.  It hooked me irrevocably.  The setting  is incredibly authentic and colorful.  The different orders of society: nobleman, servant, military man, tradesman, artisan, abbott, monk, and priest are carefully wrought to produce a period piece with more detail and clearer dialogue than a Shakespearean play.  It would be a wonderful way of introducing young people to history.  The setting of the story is 12th Century England, a period of particular turmoil.  Henry I had died without a legitimate male heir, and he had designated his daughter Matilda as his successor, binding his nobles by oath to support her.  Although many of them did, including her very able half brother, an illegitimate son of Henry made an Earl by his father, many of them threw their support behind her cousin, Steven.  Matilda, or Maud as she is referred to, was a granddaughter of William the Conqueror and no push over herself.   She fought her cousin from a base in coastal France, where the family held land in fief of the King of France and where marriage alliances had placed her as wife of Geoffery, the Duke of Anjou.  With her Norman support in France and her loyal factions in England, she made enough of a threat to Steven's rule to ultimately obtain a guarantee of succession to the English throne for her son Henry, ultimately Henry II. Until that time, warfare turned most of England into a battle ground and life for everyone a matter of ceaseless uncertainty.  Added to this was the rancour still apparent in the social divisions between the largely Saxon population and their Norman rulers.  The fall of the Saxon monarchy was only a hundred years previous and hostility still existed.Cadfael, the central character of the series, is a Dominican monk and herbalist, and Dereck Jacobi is the perfect personification of him.  He has a presence which suggests strength, wisdom, and compassion.  Unlike most of the other brothers, Cadfael had spent most of his life in the secular world where he participated in the crusades, had adventures, fell in and out of love, and took his order after finding the ways of the world wanting.  He comes from a different culture, that of Wales, and sees that of England through an outsider's more objective eyes.  His experience with life and the motives of men and his keen awareness of detail makes him the perfect sleuth, and when murder is committed, the civil authorities are more than willing to have him clear things up for them.  In One Corpse Too Many, probably the best of the series, the forces of Queen Maude and those of Steven clash.  The castle and Maude's supporters are captured, but not until the leaders of the rebellion make their escape.  Steven vows to have them, and puts the castle's owner to torture to extract the information from him.  When he refuses, Steven puts all the defenders to death.  The monks of the Abbey having asked the king's leave to bury the victims, request Cadfael, who has "experience in these matters" to take over the detail of returning the bodies to the families.  He agrees but discovers that there is "one corpse too many."  Once Steven is convinced that a murder unpunished will reflect badly upon the king's justice, he commissions Cadfael to discover the villain.  This is the first time that the character of the nobleman Hugh Beringer (Eorin McCarthy) is introduced.  In his attempt to win the trust of Steven, he is given a mission which places him athwart Cadfael.  The two match wits with interesting outcomes.  The end of the film is a fine display of trial by combat.  A thoroughly real and well researched visit to the Middle Ages.
