Though lacking the all star cast that that 1963 comedy had, "The Great Race" is every bit as funny and ranks up with "It's A Mad,Mad..." as one of the greatest slapstick comedies ever made.Daredevil The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) is loved by all: talented, handsome and kind, he is the ideal man for many woman and his stunts have made him a millionaire. Everyone loves him. Well, almost every one. Enter Leslie's arch nemesis, Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon). Along with his not very smart henchman (to put it mildly) Max (Peter Falk), Professor Fate will stop at nothing to top Leslie and become him. However, every attempt goes hilariously wrong. But he then hatches a scheme that he knows won't fail. He will complete against Leslie in a 20, 000 mile race from New York to Paris and beat him, thus winning the respect of the world. Also competing is beautiful suffragette newspaper reporter Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), who captures the eye of both Leslie and Fate. Everything culminates into a nonstop laugh riot, including the greatest pie fight in the history of entertainment."The Great Race" is a classic comedy that is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. I highly recommend it.
