No worries there are no handstands or acrobatics in this video! Just a workout centered on stretching and Yogic moves. I did workout before pregnancy. This is my second pregnancy, during my first I did water aerobics and walked. This is not an option with a toddler at home in the winter. I have other prenatal yoga dvds and workout videos. Most of the Yoga dvds for pregnancy are to melodic and I feel like falling asleep half way through by the fourth time I do it. I read a lot of negative reviews about this video and almost didn't buy it. But I noticed that even in the critical reviews they said they would keep on doing the workout. This is the most controversial DVD I have ever bought, and I am glad I did get it. If you are doing your workouts using instructional videos you know that no matter how hard or fast it is by the 5th time you do it you will have it practically memorized, so I find her quickness in routine a plus. Once I have done this workout a few times I won't be board or fast forwarding through long pauses or explanations. Also there is an instructional section that goes over most of the sections people complained about in slow motion. I am not athletic, flexible, or even in shape, just healthy and I was able to do the advanced moves 80% of the time. Also I have done or seen  a version of  2 out of 3 of the exercises on this video. The new exercises where great and I am glad I did them. This is different from traditional Yoga videos so it is a good by to mix it up a little. The only exercise I will not do is the back bend but I just do the set up for it. The only people who might not want to try this video are those with some kind of chronic health problem, the obese, anyone with a truly at risk pregnancy, the lazy and unmotivated or those who are easily frustrated. However I am only giving this video 4 stars because The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1 by her sister is a better workout video in my opinion and it sets the bar really high. However some one who is more in to flexibility and movement oriented workouts would like this one better.
