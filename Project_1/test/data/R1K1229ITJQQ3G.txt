Write off Billy as an MTV cartoon character, but he has more balls and a better voice than any other singer from the 70's punk or 80's hard rock scene.  On this dvd his voice sounds as strong as ever; and to say the performance is extremely high energy and spirited is putting it mildly.  With Steve Stevens back on guitar this album builds to  a climax that flat-out rocks concluding with &quot;Mony Mony&quot; &amp; a great cover of the Door's &quot;LA Woman&quot;.  The songs sound as fresh now as the did almost 20 years ago. Idol is one of only a few singers who can combine good ole' 50's Eddie Cochran-Gene Vincent era rock 'n' roll, 70's punk, and 80's hard rock.    Billy's ace in the hole is Steven's guitar.  Stevens  rips thru the Gen X classic &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; and the acoustic playing on &quot;Cradle Of Love&quot; is killer 50's style Hank Marvin or James Burton.The sound is great and Billy's band comes thru loud and clear.I may not be Ernest Hemingway but I know my music as well as anyone.   If you are or even were a Billy Idol fan this dvd is a must have.  And as far as generation gap?  My 9 year old daughter must have played &quot;Mony, Mony&quot; and least 10 times in a row.  Of course I told her Billy  was singing &quot;Get paid, get luck&quot; during the chorus.
