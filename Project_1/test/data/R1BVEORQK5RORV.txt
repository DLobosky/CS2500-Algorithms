I didn't expect to love it as much as I did! Set in 1886, a society girl from England and her maid are sent to America for an arranged marriage to a wealthy family's son. The flighty Charlotte convinces her maid Dora (yes, it took a while to stop singing the theme song every time I saw her name) to swap places with her because they look alike and the American family has only seen a mediocre picture. Dora, with Cinderella dream, agrees, and the outcome is more difficult and enlightening than either of them expected.I didn't love how the ending turned out for one of them because I think another resolution would have been truer to her character, but that didn't diminish my opinion of the book. It's rich with literary, cultural, and historical references, and it adeptly handles the gap between the rich and the poor that is nothing new in our country, even though statistics released last week indicate that the gap is growing. And I loved, loved, loved the appendix with pictures from Harper's Bazaar and catalogs from Bloomingdale's, both from the late 1800s, that the author used when describing the dresses worn by Dora, Charlotte, and Beatrice. (Bethany House provided this book for my review. My opinions are my own.)
