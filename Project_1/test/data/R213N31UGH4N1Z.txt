I read it in college. It is still one of my 5 favorites. I felt identified with the characters so much that while reading it I felt the same pain and agony of the two heroes.If you have read before other Hardy books then you may think this is another sentimentalist "soap opera" book. But it is not. This is a masterpiece of literature. I recommend that you start reading Hardy from here.
