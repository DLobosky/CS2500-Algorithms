Incorporating challenging arm balancing poses into the sun salutation.As stated in the title this is a `power' practice so there is a flowing sequence to the poses and it moves very quickly from one position to the next. I noticed that sometimes even Rodney's dubbed in voice instruction had trouble keeping up. Those with a basic knowledge of the poses shouldn't have any problems but be aware that some of the arm balancing postures are quite advanced. The instruction here, although brisk is easy to follow and the workout has been filmed on a cliff overlooking a Maui beach so there's some nice scenery too. The same music has been used here as on other DVDs but you won't mind because it's quite good.I did find this practice to be slightly repetitive, in that it's a long series of Sun Salutations alternating with advanced arm balancing postures. I would recommend 'Power Yoga Flexibility' over this or better yet both workouts are available on one DVD (Power Yoga Strength & Flexibility) for a few dollars more. The practice includes; Sun Salutations, Powerful pose, Exalted Warrior, Side arm balance (bent & straight leg) Staff, Sage and Crane poses. Eastern Plank pose, Cobblers and Pendulum pose, Cross Legged lunge (in the air) Simple arm balance and a brief relaxation at he end. The only props needed are a strap and your yoga mat. Highly recommended for an intense, quick workout Namaste
