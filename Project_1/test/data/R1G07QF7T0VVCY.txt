Her commentary covers the war on terrorism, the 2004 presidential election, the state of the Democratic Party, Max Cleland, Bill Clinton, and Freedom of speech is just some of her topics.
 
 I finished this in one day. Ms. Coulter is a brilliant writer that is intelligent, witty, and sarcastic. Combine that with her logical and candid manner and you can see why this very articulate woman is on the bestseller list. A very easy read. This book is entertaining and thought-provoking.
 
 Media attacks her all the time that is why I had to get one of her books. After hearing her I am amazed at irresponsible criticisms that have been falsely leveled at this woman. She backs all she says with facts. It is just some find it hard to swallow the truth, even when served with such witty sarcasm.
