This razor WILL save you BIG MONEY if you're currently using a manual blade system like the Gillette Fusion or Mach-3.Manual replacement blades, which cost big money, definitely last very little time before they become dull. I got this Braun razor about a year ago for $199.99 and it came with a $50.00 Amazon gift certificate. So I got an amazing razor, the best they make for $150.00 since I'm def going to be using the gift certificates for stuff I need at the already lowest price. I no longer have to buy a new pack of blades every 4 weeks (only have to replace the blade set once a year now for $25.00) and no shave cream ever (have to buy cleaning and lubrication packs though) and I never get irritated skin anymore.So now I've spent $150.00 + $25.00 + $50.00 = $225.00 for the first year and a half I've used this razor instead of $25.00 x 18 months (what I had been paying every 4 weeks for blades) + $100.00 (18 months of shave cream) + $15 for stupid razor handle-thing= $565.00The manual blade system cost me roughly 2.5 times what I now pay, and as a plus I no longer get irritated skin ever.
