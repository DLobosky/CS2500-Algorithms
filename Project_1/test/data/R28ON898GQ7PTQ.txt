Pixar's ninth film is another triumph for the studio because it deftly bends comedy, action, emotion and awe-inspiring animation that should take everyone's breath away. This is a film that has very few words (especially in the first part of it) but the characters are very well rounded despite their ability to say very few words. It's impossible not to root for Wall-E, he is a character that has a sunny disposition despite being all alone and when EVE arrives, he'll do anything to be with her. This movie has a lot of messages but fortunately, they are not pushed down your throat. Wall-E despite many environmental undertones, it's a love story. And is a wonderful one.The animation in Wall-E is as usual for Pixar, simply outstanding. You will stare in awe as the realistic look of the space, the Earth and many other settings. The comedic timing is impeccable and is remiscent of old silent films from the 1920's. The emotion feels honest and the cast of characters is spectacular. Round this with an amazing score from Thomas Newman and you get a masterpiece. Video & AudioWall-E in Bd looks absolutely amazing. This is not surprise as all the other Pixar films looks spectacular on HD. You will see every detail, every texture. Detail is sharp and colors are well reproduced. A magnificent transafer.The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also outstanding. There is directionality in every way and every sound is perfectly clear without any type of distortion.Bonus Features:This is a loaded 2-disc BD set with phenomenal bonus material. On disc 1 you have cine-explore which is a commentary with director Andrew Stanton. Also you have two great shorts - Presto and Burn-E. On disc two you have a lot of featurettes that delves with the creation of the film such as story, characters, sound design among others. Also you have publicity material and galleries. But thehighlight of the disc is without any doubt the amazing documentary "The Pixar Story" directed by Leslie Iwerks that delves with how Pixar was founded and came to be the most succesful animation company in the world. Is an insightful and fun documentary that no one should miss. The documentary goes from the very beginning of Pixar when it was a Lucasfilm division until the release of Cars in 2006. I hope they do a follow up covering the rest of the films (from Ratatouille onwards). You also have some games and othe material.The amount of bonus content is amazing making this one of the best BD sets ever.A DVD copy of the film is also included.Closing thoughts:Wall-E is an instant classic film that proves that Pixar can do no wrong. Bending comedy, action and honest emotion with a cast of great characters and wonderful music, this movie is a must own for everyone. Disney has put an spectacular package with truly amazing video & aundio and oustading bonus material, this is a set that everyone should buy. Very Highly Recommended!!!
