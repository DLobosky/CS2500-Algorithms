I don't know how they came up with these "100 Best Letters" and it can be argued that there are better, but these are examples of some of the best.  Reading them you will and using them will give you the tone, and pace that is effective. Studying them will show you the components necessary in all successful direct sales.This is an extremely useful tool for anyone selling or using persuasion to make a point in print or otherwise.
