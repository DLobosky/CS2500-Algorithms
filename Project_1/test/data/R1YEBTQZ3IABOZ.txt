His non-violent style, relying only on his faith and his razor-sharp wits, holds the potential to help tame graphic novels as well. Perhaps other comic artists and writers will pick up this concept of a non-violent, spiritual hero and run even further with it.Harvey is the creation of Steve Sheinkin, whose other professional pursuit is writing history textbooks for schoolchildren. As you might guess, Sheinkin's true passion in working on history texts is trying to provide students more of the fascinating bits of history that are left out of traditional textbooks.In the case of the two Rabbi Harvey graphic novels, it's a little tough to sort out what's history and what's not. There were Jews in the Old West, but Rabbi Harvey himself is a fictional character. He's a creation of Sheinkin's fertile mind, but he's also acting out roles in traditional Jewish folk tales that span many centuries. (In fact, in the back of this first book, Sheinkin provides a suggested list for further reading in Jewish folklore. In the back of his sequel, knowing that readers are interested in these connections, he expands this appendix and explains in greater detail where the original patterns of these stories emerged.)Each book has about 120 pages of comics (a few more in Volume 2). The comics are black-and-white drawings, colored in a limited pallet of beige, gold and brown that suggests antique images from many years ago.In this second volume, "Big Milt," the most popular bad guy from the first book returns. This time, Harvey's got an even more devious way of ensnaring Big Milt in his own evil ways to disarm him before someone gets killed. But the big news is the introduction of Abigail, a smart, tough pioneer woman who quickly catches Harvey's eye.Should you start with Volume 1? The answer is: You could. But this is developing into a great saga. Sheinkin already is planning Volume 3 and I hope we'll read many more over the years! So, if you haven't read Volume 1, buy them both. Amazon makes it easy. And, stay tuned for Volume 3, when rumor has it that Harvey and Abigail will see a lot more of each other.
