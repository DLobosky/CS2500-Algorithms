Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of "exploring strange new worlds"...Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of "shapeshifters" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere "Apocalypse Rising" in which the crew suspects Gowron is a mole, having been infiltrated by a Changeling. Ben, Miles, and Odo disguise themselves as Klingons and discover that General Martok is the real traitor among them... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include "Rapture" in which Sisko dreams of seeing Bajor's future and the vision warns him in regard to the planet joining the Federation, and "Soldiers of the Empire" in which Worf and Dax accompany General Martok following his release from a Dominion prison camp, but the rendezvous turns out to be more than they bargained for when their ship comes under attack...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 5) DVD:Episode 99 (Apocalypse Rising)Episode 100 (The Ship)Episode 101 (Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places)Episode 102 (...Nor the Battle to the Strong)Episode 103 (The Assignment)Episode 104 (Trials and Tribble-ations)Episode 105 (Let He Who is Without Sin...)Episode 106 (Things Past)Episode 107 (The Ascent)Episode 108 (Rapture)Episode 109 (The Darkness and the Light)Episode 110 (The Begotten)Episode 111 (For the Uniform)Episode 112 (In Purgatory's Shadow)Episode 113 (By Inferno's Light)Episode 114 (Doctor Bashir, I Presume?)Episode 115 (A Simple Investigation)Episode 116 (Business as Usual)Episode 117 (Ties of Blood and Water)Episode 118 (Ferengi Love Songs)Episode 119 (Soldiers of the Empire)Episode 120 (Children of Time)Episode 121 (Blaze of Glory)Episode 122 (Empok Nor)Episode 123 (In the Cards)Episode 124 (Call to Arms)The DVD Report
