I moved up from a set of Energy C-5 speakers that I thought were good but was very harsh sounding when I turn up the volume. Those were supposed to be efficient 8 ohm speakers. I was also told that these speakers are inefficient power hungry speakers that may not sound very good without an external amplifier.Well, like they say, seeing, or in this case hearing is believing. At least for myself, I broke one myth but reinforced another.1. Myth one: You will need external amplifiers to drive 4 ohm speakers. False. I pushed these with an Onkyo 808 135 watts at 8ohms, 180 at 4 ohms? There was absolutely no clipping at ear blistering level. No harshness whatsoever from these speakers that I heard from the C-5. At high volume, the C-5 gave me a headache. However, these were still extremely smooth. These speakers are 89db efficiency at 1 watt, so if I push it to 110db, it would require only 128 watts to push. 110db is far louder than comfortable for most living rooms. I guess if you like listen to it louder, then external amplification would be needed. Most normal people wouldn't. Tip: Don't set the receiver to 4 ohm mode. Leave it at 8 ohms. The 4 ohm mode only serve to cut the power output to protect the receiver. My receiver has two fans that I never noticed turning on. Onkyo got smart by inserting fans. Previously, they were hot enough to cook eggs.2. Myth two: Better speakers is the best place to put your money if you want superior sound. True. However, the caveat is that there is an absolute diminishing rate of return the more you spend. These are amazing sounding speakers with extreme clarity. Even at lower volume, I could make out the instruments. That is not true with all speakers. Since I am not an audiophile, I can't tell you how much better a pair of speakers that cost five times as much would sound. However, I don't care to find out. These speakers are so amazing sounding, that I don't want to fall into the upgradeitis trap that would force me to buy better speakers, receiver, amps, etc. for ever more diminishing levels of return (I guess it's too late, I already bought these to replace C-5). When you hit this price level, you'd have to spend 200% more just to gain perhaps 5-10% in clarity. Even at that point, the improvements are pretty subjective.If you can get these speakers and have enough power to drive them (135 is enough for me), I suggest you do so. If you love to listen to music or watch movies, you'll wonder why you listen to them with low end speakers at all.Polk makes absolutely great speakers that sound good and look good. Some of the best sounding speakers are ugly which does not do any favor for the wife factor. Some audiophiles look down on Polk for their mass market appeal and made in China manufacturing. However, the mass market aspect and the fact that they're made in China means that you are getting value for your speakers. Speakers that sell to a limited group of people and made in North America (or Europe, B&W anyone?) will cost 2 to 3 times as much. The Polk LSI15 are a real steal, even at this price.
