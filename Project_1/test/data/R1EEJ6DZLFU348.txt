While previous albums blended the hard rockin' fury of artists like The Ramones, Kiss & Joan Jett, "Gold Medal" turns the "rawkin'" knob down a few notches for a more tame and dare I say "commercial" sound.  Now the band's influences seem to draw more from The Knack, Loverboy & The Bangles than the previous mentioned artists (I'm not joking for once) .  If "Gold Medal" is listened to with an ignorance of the previous Donnas albums,  a pleasant listening experience might result.  It's an okay power-pop, punk-lite album.   But if you already own any of the previous albums, you may be pretty disappointed here. You'll be really disappointed when your mom doesn't tell you to turn this one down, because you don't really want to turn it up. If you are new to the Donnas, best enter the words "rock", "roll" & "machine" in the search box now and take a pass here.  Current  fans will no doubt want to purchase this cd.   I strongly recommend holding off on your purchase for awhile then search eBay or zShops for a good price. ****May 2007 zShops Used Price Update....Told you so!****
