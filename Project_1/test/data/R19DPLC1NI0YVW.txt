I have collected the toys, read the books, have the posters, etc, etc. Like I said a huge Star Wars fan. So, when I heard that George Lucas was making a prequel trilogy I was very excited and I looked forward to the moment that I could once again see a Star Wars film on the big screen. Well when that day came in May of 1999 I was at the first showing and could not get the grin off my face when the 20th Century Fox logo and theme came on the screen. And when that classic line popped up on the screen "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..." I knew that this was for real. Star Wars was back, but it was different. I didn't expect the new film to be as good as the original Trilogy, but I still had hopes. While The Phantom Menace was entertaining and full of the great lightsaber fights and space battles we have come to love, it was missing something. I have never expected Oscar caliber acting from these films, but I have to say that some of the performances were just awful. But most of that can be attributed to the script these actors were working from. I have heard a lot of people claim that these films were not meant for everyone and that they were intended for kids. You are fooling yourselves. These films are supposed to be for everyone, for families. And the PG-13 rating for Episode III has shown us that Lucas has not meant for these to be just for children. Don't let the marketing of toys and cereal fool you into thinking these are kids movies. My main problem with the Phantom Menace is the introduction of Jar Jar Binks. I know a lot of people feel this is a racist character that pokes fun at black people. Well I am black and I don't find the character offensive I just think it is stupid and annoying. I also think Jar Jar takes away from the film and I think Lucas realized that which would explain his dwindling screen time over the next two films. Also Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker was a poor casting choice. As we have seen with such child stars as Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning, children can act and Lucas could have picked a better young boy to play this role. In fact on this DVD there is a bonus feature that shows the casting for Anakin and there were obviously better actors that did not get this role. But as any fan of Star Wars has eventually realized, we will never know what goes on in Lucas' head. But in spite of all of that, Episode I is still an entertaining film and I really loved the newest villian Darth Maul and the introduction of the double bladed lightsaber. I almost had an accident in my pants when I first saw him ignite the second blade on his lightsaber. He is a great addition to the Star Wars universe and the fights scenes in this film are incredible. Also let me add that yet again John Williams proves that he is the master of movie soundtracks. Star Wars films wouldn't be the same if not for John Williams' music. Duel of the Fates is one of the best pieces of music from all of the films and a music video is included on one of the discs. Despite this being the worst film of all six films, this two DVD set is still a must have for every collection and adds much to the story and gives us insight into why Darth Vader turned to the dark side. Lucas really put a lot into this DVD set and it shows. From the menus to all of the bonus materials this is a loaded DVD. This film looks and sounds great and as both a Star Wars fan and a movie buff I am proud to have it in my collection.
