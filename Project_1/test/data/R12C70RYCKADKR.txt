I keep going over Bill Phillips,&quot;Body for Life,&quot; for almost a year now. It's the last diet and workout book you'll ever need.Bill tells  you what kind of foods to eat,and shows you,with picture's,the best weight  workouts,and the proper way to do the sets,and how many.You don't have to  be in the gym for hours doing hundreds of different machins and lifts.Bill  just does the basics,and he looks fantastic.Also,I love the idea of  cheating once a week,eating anything you want.Even if you want three Big  Mac's,Bill tells you to &quot;go for it.&quot;There's only one thing that  Bill doesn't tell you in this book, and the pictures of people before and  after are hard to believe.I use to weigh over 350,and I had all kinds of  flab and fat I couldn't get rid of through workingout and diets.I finnally  had an Abdominal plasty surgery done two months ago.If anyone wants to see  my before and after pictures,give me an e-mail,and I'll send you my  web-page,about the surgery,and my photo's. I want to thank Bill again.After  being layed up for weeks,and not being able to workout,I'm starting to lift  again,and have been using Bill's workout routines.Like I said before,after  almost a year,&quot;Body for Life&quot; is still helping me get into  shape,and recover from my surgery.
