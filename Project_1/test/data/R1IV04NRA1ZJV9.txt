An powerful empire,a new ruler,and a man worthy enough to  change a dynasty,a slave who would become a gladiator, a man who become legendary to his people.Ridley Scott's epic so beautiful so intense , so gripping , and so dramatic that it can only be  called truly epic.Academy Award nominee Russel Crow gives this  Roman epic life in his role as Maximus the brave slave general who is betrayed by his empire for not complying with the wish  of his new ruler Commodus (Joquin Pheonix) who has forced him  self as the new ruler of Rome by killing the previous Ceaser  for not giving Commodus rule over Rome.Commodus is a pitiful  ruler that is calculating , benevolent , pathetic , hateful  when Maximus refuses to take Commodus's hand in rule he finds that he pays the price when he looses everything dear to him and is forced into slavery to become a Gladiator , when he  becomes a great Gladiator he is given the honor to fight in  the colloseium when he becomes a hero amongst the people he is forced to give his identity as Maximus the general gaining  the support from his men , he devises a plan to escape and join his soldiers to build an army to overthrow Commodus from power when Commodus finds out the plan of Maximus he gives  the people of Rome a chance to see the great fall of the  great Maximus by challenging him in one on one combat to  the death , Maximus see's this as a chance to bring Rome  out of chaos and give it the order and freedom it deserves for it's people in doing so he will risk his life to be the greatist hero Rome has ever known.  Russel Crowe is an even more fitting potrayal of a  Gladiator then even Kirk Douglas he gives his charachter  more depth and a human side , it's evident that Crowe is one the best newcomers hollywood has ever seen he is very versitle in films and Gladiator only shows that to an even greater extent.Joqiun Pheonix is a great match for Crowe  giving Commodus depth and making us feel pity the he is  the way he is and his hatered for Maximus and his uprising. Ridley Scott has an imaginative veiw to detail as some of  the set's are detailed to what Rome would have looked like in this time the costumes accurate and the cinimatography is astounding.This may be an action movie but this movie  is worthy of it's predeccesors Sparticus , Ben Hur ,  Cleopatra they don't even near as get close to the vison of Rome the empire then in this movie.So people invest  in a DVD player cause this one is well worth the money  a truly epic film.
