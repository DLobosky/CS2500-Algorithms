It shows fathers what it means to be the leader of the home.Some of the features include book introductions, Walking in Authority, Godly Character, Passing It On, Dads in the Bible, Building Your Children, Insights, Questions and Answers, and a Topical Index.The notes help to make this a good devotional Bible for fathers.The hard cover seems sturdy. The fonts are nice and readable. The font-size looks like 8-point. The border of every page has an aged style. There are a handful of pages in the back for notes.I don't really like how the New Century Version reads. If the goal was to go with a modern version I would have preferred the NKJV. Some verses lose impact. For example, Acts 2:38 says `change' rather than `repent'. It is still worth reading.I do recommend this Bible for its notes. The notes make this Bible worth using as a devotional Bible. It's an excellent Bible for what it is and an excellent companion to the Moms Bible. Used together they would help parents grow and build stronger families. It fills a great need in today's world. While children are being bombarded with everything worldly, it is a great help to have a dad that can train up a child according to God's Word. It has many notes on being a better dad, and a few about better husband (which helps the dad to set a good example). 4 out of 5 stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I'd like to thank Thomas Nelson Publishers for providing me this Bible free as part of their [...]  book review bloggers program.
