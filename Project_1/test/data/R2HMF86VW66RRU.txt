Typically, I'm not a big fan of fantasies or science fiction books, but the story kept my interest secured through to the very end and left me wanting more NOW!! I hope Ms. Kurland continues to dabble in the fantasy arena; it makes for a different sort of read but with all the lovely elements that make her stories a joy to read. I am typically a pretty picky reader, but I have read almost all of her books more than once, some even three or four times.  Even though I know the story, I still enjoy `visiting' with characters- who feel like old friends.  I still laugh over little things that I may not have caught the first time.  And they all still make me oohh and aaahh and smile over their happiness.  For a single gal, these are great stories to live vicariously through- though it does set pretty high standards for any prospects...When Star of Morning ended, we learned that Nicholas of Lismor was a mage and he carried Morgan back to Melksham to heal from Lothar's poison. Miach didn't want to leave her but he had matters of the realm to tend to, as usual. She is never far from his mind and they're not apart for very long. He has to earn her forgiveness for lying about who he is and Morgan has to come to terms with her magic and her past. Miach is a wonderful hero- he's sweet, gentle, sensitive and yet strong in character and of course tall, dark and handsome. (LK fans, he reminded me of Patrick-A Garden in the Rain.. Doesn't hurt, especially since Patrick is Gerard Butler in my head ;-)) He has quickly become my new favorite LK leading man (a top honor that is always changing depending on what book I read last). He is so sweet and caring towards Morgan, even when she is mad at him. He always looks out for her best interests; trying to protect her even if it means leaving her behind. But Morgan isn't one to take being left behind well; not at all. She is Miach's equal is many ways- especially in their stubborn ways of thinking that they know what's best for the other. Their interactions/antics are often achingly sweet and smile/sigh-inducing. They are perfectly suited for each other and I can't wait until they get some happy time together, in peace, without worrying about any evil creatures that are tracking them or the imminent return of the evil mage, Lothar. The Mage's Daughter sets the foundation for a great battle between good and evil magic; and Miach and Morgan against Lothar and his minions. I am eagerly awaiting the conclusion to this trilogy. I tried very hard to save this for awhile and read it slowly, savoring every word. I have not found another author peer to Ms. Kurland's immense talent. She is in a class by herself in romantic fiction. She writes with such emotion, and wonderful detail and imagery that you feel apart of the story and feel like the characters are part of your own life. What a beautiful world to live in! She is the only author that is able to write absolutely beautiful romances without the unnecessary smut. Achingly sweet and beautiful stories- that leave you with a sappy smile on your face for most of the book and for some time afterwards. LK could probably write any kind of book and I'd still find it delightful. Buy all of her books; they are a fantastic investment. I have read them all over and over and still enjoy every word. I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of her next book (With Every Breath in May) and the final Nine Kingdoms installment. I can't help but smile just thinking about it! ;-)
