I loved this movie--it is one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have a very special chemistry. The plot is meant to be cute and charming, there's zero violence and almost no  profanity. It reminds of a movie from the 60s---but the fact that the main  characters met on the Internet reminded me that it is definitely a 90s  movie! I loved the backdrop of New York City's Upper West Side (my  neighborhood) and I loved the references to books (I love to read). This  movie stands along my favorite romantic comedies, it goes next to Breakfast  at Tiffany's and The Way We Were, this is a classic!
