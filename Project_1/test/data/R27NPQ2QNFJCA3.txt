It is quiet, runs cool to the touch, and it is fast. I also purchased a Thermaltake BlacX eSATA USB Docking Station and I use the eSATA connection on my ASUS N61JV-X2 notebook PC which I purchased from Amazon as well running Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. In my configuration, I decided to encrypt the Western Digital Caviar Green hard drive using Microsoft BitLocker using a very strong password that changes every 30 days.I use this new hard drive to store HDTV TV shows that I recorded live from Microsoft Windows Media Center and my AverMedia AverTV Hybrid Volar MAX USB TV Tuner stick. I also store my Apple iTunes library and my 1,050 CD collection using Apple Lossless encoding. Lastly, I keep a copy of my most critical data and software applications repository on the drive as well.There have been no problems whatsoever with the hard drive or the hard drive docking station through USB 2.0 or eSATA connection. The Western Digital Caviar Green SATA hard drive and Thermaltake BlacX eSATA USB Docking Station are excellent choices that provide for an unlimited amount of storage capacity at a low cost. I intend on purchasing more of the same hard drives in the near future as my storage needs continue to grow.Update:I contacted both Western Digital and Thermaltake technical support within the United States to inquire about more information. Thermaltake requires that their BlacX hard drive dock utilize the eSATA connection exclusively with Western Digital hard drives that require the newer Advanced Format 4k hard drive sectors especially if the maximum storage capacity exceeds 1.00 TB. Furthermore, they require that the hard drive docking unit be turned off during boot up, restart, or shut down phases within the Microsoft Windows 7 64 bit environment. SATA must be set to ACHI mode within the BIOS to utilize this hard drive properly. After I ran the Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows software application, the WD15EARS passed the S.M.A.R.T. test on multiple occasions. Microsoft's chkdsk utility revealed no problems. Utilizing Microsoft BitLocker drive encryption took several hours to complete.This hard drive is extremely quiet and it gets as warm as body temperature under peak operational conditions. I plan on running additional stress tests for the next three months before I transfer or store any critical data on it given the atrocious reviews written by other purchasers or owners of this exact hard drive. This is my first Western Digital hard drive after I purchased an external Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1.50 TB hard drive with a USB 2.0 interface. It was much noisier and it ran hotter which caused consternation for me about its longevity and reliability.As long as your computer and operating system are relatively new and you use this hard drive as a standalone unit, it represents the best balance among price, speed, storage capacity, and reliability on the market as of 11/25/2010.Happy Thanksgiving!
