I was an and am a U2 fan since here early days with Boy, War and October and in many cases a band is usually best when there young and hungry, but not in U2s case. They started out brilliantly and got even better. Joshua Tree is just an outstanding album, every song is great and it has a feel to it, a sadness, a beauty, something that is mood altering and allows one when listening to slip into a stare of contemplation. When I first got this CD years ago I played the heck out of it and I continue to play it to this day. It simply is one of those must have rock n roll albums that everyone should have.
