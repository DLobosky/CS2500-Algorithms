I feel that some types of meditation works better for some than for others, and maybe this one didn't work as well for me. The book is a thin volume with a meditation CD, and the price is really affordable, so I think it's worth a try if you are curious. You don't have much to lose. But I still feel that the guided Meditations for Manifesting is better. [...].
