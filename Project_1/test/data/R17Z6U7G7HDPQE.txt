She's never really had a boyfriend or been in love and so she starts to feel fake. Along with her two best friends she decides she will enroll in the all boys school and get to know how boys really think. She than starts to have feelings for her roommate. Yes, this book is very much like She's The Man (the movie). I'm sure I'm not the first person to say that and I won't be the last.  Babe In Boyland is a cute fun novel. There isn't a lot of depth or substance to it but I think that is the point. It's a feel good, guilty pleasure read. There are some laugh out moments and some true lessons in it if you look beyond the surface but its still a "fun" book to read.  I enjoyed all the characters throughout the book and I liked the way they all came together. Honestly, there isn't much more to say about this one. Its just a cutesy book and I loved it. It was somewhat predictable but I still couldn't stop reading. I just had to know what was going to happen. The only part of the book that bugged me a little was how Natalie put a sock down her pants. Why bother right? I could have done without that detail. HAHA! Overall: I really loved it. But than again, I also loved the movie She's The Man. This is my idea of a fun night in, cuddling up with a good book to make you smile! Cover: The cover is cute. Its kind of plain but still cute.What I'd Give It:5/5 Cupcakes__________________________Review Based On Hardcover EditionTaken from Princess Bookie (blog)
