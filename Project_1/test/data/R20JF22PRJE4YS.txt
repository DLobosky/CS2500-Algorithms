I've completely fallen head over heels in love with the Marina's Tales series by Derrolyn Anderson!  After reading The Moon and the Tide, which is book 2 in May I knew I was hooked to Marina and all that was happening in her life!  Book three, The Fate of the Muse, continues the story of Marina and the mermaids!!  After all the trauma that Marina went through with the kidnapping in the last book it seems the beginning of this book is mostly about her recovering from all the damages that caused to her mind.  She is slowly recovering and finding strength again.  Marina and Ethan continue to grow stronger together and life slowly becomes normal again.  However, we know things don't always seem to stay "normal" in Marina's life!!  She also has to face the fate of what the mermaid council will decide about the weird events she has caused.The Fate of the Muse is great!! Like all the other books in this series it jammed packed with more unique twists and new characters, adventure, danger and of course ROMANCE!!  The best thing about this series, at least in my opinion, is the romance between Ethan and Marina!!  Their relationship has become more intense and passionate yet they begin to struggle with what we all struggle with in relationships; doubt and worry about the future!  I really enjoyed the fact that they are still together! I can't stress enough that I am happy the author hasn't created some ridiculous love triangle but has kept these two lovebirds together even amongst their struggles.There wasn't as much history on mermaids as in book two and I was hoping we would get a little more information about the new little mermaid that was added to the story. However, we did learn some new things about mermaids and possibly a reason behind why Marina can communicate with the mermaids and live on land.  All interesting and unique perspectives added to the story!  Again Derrolyn has an amazing way of describing the details that really makes story come alive!I am really glad that I continued reading this series and I will be anxiously awaiting book four; which was a pleasant surprise to find out it wasn't a trilogy.  The Fate of the Muse ended a bit sad for me and I'm hoping that things all get figured out and that book four leaves a smile on my face!!  If you've loved this series as much as I have, be sure to grab book four as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't read Marina's Tales yet...what are you waiting for??Content: A little more sexual than the other 2 books, there was some implied situations but no descriptions. I received a copy of this book to read and review from the author. My review is not biased by the fact that I was given this book. I HONESTLY read and review any book whether bought or given to me. If I did not like the book I would definitely not give a rave review or recommend it.
