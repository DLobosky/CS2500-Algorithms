Some of the below is included in my other reviews of the series but I like to know the order of books in a series, so I'm providing that for anyone else like me out there :)In order they are His Majesty's Dragon [Captain Will Laurence meets hatchling dragon Temeraire] Throne of Jade [Laurence and Temeraire travel to China on a diplomatic mission] Black Powder Wars [Laurence and Temeraire go to Istanbul to retrieve three new eggs, including a fire breather] Empire of Ivory [Laurence and Temeraire visit Africa and battle a society of dragons intent on world domination] Victory of Eagles [Laurence and Temeraire face the consequences of their treason as Napoleon invades England and occupies London, resulting in the death of many of their friends]. There is a sixth book coming out at some point but I can't figure out when. This is a great book... one of my favorites in the series but this is the first time I really get aggravated with Temeraire.  He has no concept of consequences.  But I have to keep in mind that at this point in his development he is still a child and so my expectations of him should reflect that.  But he gets Laurence and his friends into quite a few pickles without thinking of anyone but really his own opinions of right and wrong.  I guess it really boils down to he has no empathy.  But he's still charming - much like other three year olds I know =) - and the dynamic between him and Laurence is outstanding.The summary of the book that is set out on the cover doesn't really cover the actual tale.  Yes, they set out to retrieve the cure but that is a minor part of the story really - it's what happens while they retrieve the cure that has the most impact on the outcome of the book.  I won't spoil it but there are some great book club kinds of issues that can be used to discuss prejudice, equality, slavery, and consequences of social mores.
