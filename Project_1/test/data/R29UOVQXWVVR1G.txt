This is a very entertaining movie with great car chase, gun fight, explosion, face off scenes and an acceptably suspenseful storyline. Good acting from Cruise and Hoffman, I must say. However, you can feel that something is missing. Scenes as memorable as those in I and II are rare, if any. The style of J.J. Abrams is much weaker than those of his predecessors. In fact, he didnt leverage on the score at all. In short, disregarding the MI label, it's still an outstanding action thriller. Recommended!
