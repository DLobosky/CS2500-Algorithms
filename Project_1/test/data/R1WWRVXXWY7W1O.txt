This is what it's all about folks! Recorded in a night club atmosphere this is the next best thing to being there. Jeff and band seem to be having the best time of there lives and project it in there music and performances. This has got to be a reference level DVD that all others should be measured against. The performance, the video, the audio are all of equal levels of perfection. The absolute best DVD I have ever had the pleasure of watching! Jeff Beck has always been a premier Guitar God along with Clapton. A must have for any audio/video enthusiast and even more so for for fans!!!I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.*****2.*****3.*****Bands that wish to have there performances recorded and recognised should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.
