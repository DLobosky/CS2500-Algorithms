Brown's novel, The Russian Revolution of 1991 is a gripping story that takes place primarily in Russia and in the Washington, DC area, but the author's vast and technical knowledge puts the reader in a roller coaster adventure full of twists and turns  in the air, on the land, and at sea.Forces in both the USSR and America see the end of the Cold War as a drain on their power and use their resources to ignite an international incident that will rekindle it.Main characters F18 Jet Pilot, Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Scott Horton and Legal Officer/NFO Navy Commander Anne Jordan team up to get to get to the bottom of and expose powerful American bad guys and prevent a catastrophe.The author cleverly weaves a believable tale using real and fictional characters and historical events to keep readers sitting on their chairs rapidly flipping pages of this riveting thriller from beginning to end.Espionage, treason, murder, romance, clandestine and well-developed characters--this 205-page educational, mesmerizing and haunting story has it all.  Enjoy it.
