The band carried on with Ritchie bringing in former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner for this album. It's nowhere near the greatest, but there are some really stellar tracks here (Fire in the Basement, King of Dreams), along with some absolute drek, too (Breakfast in Bed, the worst Purple song ever). About the only thing that saves this from being a Rainbow album is the presence of Jon Lord. I'd buy other Purple before this one, but it's not as awful as some folks would have you believe.
