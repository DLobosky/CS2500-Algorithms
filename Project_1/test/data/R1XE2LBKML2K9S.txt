You can tell by the song titles.  There are at minimum, 27 different releases on 24 different labels of his Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings from 1949-1952 when he was 19 to 22 years old.  At least 3 of these songs appear to be from after those years.  His early songs are so fine.  It's very hard to go wrong.  Don't be fooled.  His early stuff is great.  Some of the songs have great horns that swing hard.  Others are very emotional.  There's apparently 41 to 42 released songs from this period and they appear on 1) The Complete Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings 1949-1952, 2) Ray Charles 45 Great Performances and 3) Mess Around.  All three are 2xCD sets.  This stuff rocks, in the classic Ray way.
