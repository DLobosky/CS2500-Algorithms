I originally purchased a package of miso for a specific recipe (of all things--a Thanksgiving Day side dish that called for "miso butter").  And I can now say:  Hey, this is great stuff!  It adds a lot of unique flavor to a dish, and I really like this flavor!  When we're talking umami, why aren't we talking miso, along with soy sauce and other products?  And it's good for you--at least it is if you don't kill the beneficial organisms by high heat.There are some great recipes in this book:  For "toppings" for steamed veggies, for adding to soups, for making dips and sauces.  There are some very good salad recipes.  There are average recipes for main dishes that will give you ideas for adding miso to your favorite everyday meals.Positive/Negative:  The little conversion charts for salt, miso and soy sauce are helpful. Miso can add more flavor to a dish with less sodium than salt.  But the miso called for in these recipes is from "The American Miso Company", whose products I have not found locally, nor on Amazon.com.  And the type of miso is listed in English, with no Japanese equivalant.  This means that it's not real easy to go into your local Asian market and find "barley miso", for example,because you do not have the Japanese name for it.  But, hey, you can always buy a few packages of different colored miso pastes and do some common sense experimenting.For those of you who choose your cookbooks by presentation, (how many pictures, quality of paper and cover material, etc.), you may not be real happy with this cookbook if you pay the full cover price of $10.95.  It is a real basic, below-average-quality publication.  But if you want to add to the quality and "mystery" and umami of your cooking, this book is a worthwhile addition to your collection.
