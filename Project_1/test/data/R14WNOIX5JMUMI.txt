I tried this mix on a whim and I'm so glad I did.  My husband is already requesting we order more... it will be a new staple in our house.  I made the Herb & Cheese bread as mini-loafs, but next time I'm thinking of mini-muffins.  The seasoning reminds me of the Red Lobster cheddar & herb biscuits.  The bread bakes up just perfect - browned on the outside, soft on the inside.  Delicious!
