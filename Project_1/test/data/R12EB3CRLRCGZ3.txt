After a little calibration (the factory settings on TV's are always lousy) it looks amazing. I have it hooked up to my PS3 via hdmi and it's like I'm in a movie theater when watching Blu-Rays. Sound from the speakers is just fine but lets face it, you want a proper sound system. But this one is adequate for built in speakers on an LCD. Games look amazing too. During really dark scenes you'll notice a tiny backlight bleed in the four corners. This is an inherent flaw in LCD technology and pretty much all brands suffer from it to some degree from Panasonic, to Samsung. to Toshiba. Other than that this LCD is simply awesome. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
