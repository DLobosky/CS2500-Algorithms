The dog house puppy mold is hard to do, so it almost always requires an adult or older child to really squish the moon dough in there to form all the features on the dog or you'll have missing chunks where the moon dough didn't fill the mold.My main issue is that I have discovered how unbelievably MESSY Moon Dough is.  It's incredibly annoying.  It flakes apart and gets absolutely everywhere.  It's hard to get back together.  You have to really work it with your hands.  It's frustrating for my 3 year old when it falls apart and she can't get it back together, either that or she just gives up and leaves the flakes everywhere making for a long cleanup.  Good news is if you don't want to bother with the clean up, since it's lightweight and dry, it shouldn't hurt your vacuum!!
