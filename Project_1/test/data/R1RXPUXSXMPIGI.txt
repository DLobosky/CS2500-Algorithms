I bought this adapter and a different adapter for a trip to London.  It's true; this seems to be a universal adapter.  I could use my American devices there with this, and I'd be able to use a UK device I brought home with this.  I would, except that I deliberately left it behind.  It works, sort of.  Once I plugged it into the wall, I had to repeatedly push it back into the outlet.  When visiting a friend, she plugged this into a power strip resting on the floor, but the slightest movement (or even no movement, it seemed,) would knock it right out again.That other adapter I bought at about half the price is also universal, never fell out of an outlet and was quite a bit smaller than this one.  I'll be keeping that one.Remember that these are not converters, just adapters, and if your device can't handle the voltage in the country you're visiting, you'll need to get a converter or find another way.  (My cell phone would have smoked if I'd plugged it in with this, so I charged it via USB with my laptop.)
