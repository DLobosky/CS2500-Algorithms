OK, I bought this based on the near-unanimous praise the album has received from almost every critic and publication I trust.I listened to it once, and I have no urge to ever listen to it again.Nothing attracted me, nothing &quot;hooked&quot; me. The lyrics are a kick to read though. I was actually quite impressed by those alone, but the melodies and instrumentation...the &quot;music&quot;...left me with nothing. Zip. Nada.Actually, I think one of the worst things you could ever say about an album is that you'd never want to hear it again, don't you think? I was left with such apathy towards it...
