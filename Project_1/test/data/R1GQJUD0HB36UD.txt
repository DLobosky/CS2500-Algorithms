They are sturdy enough to handle entree appetizers, such as buffalo wings or baby back ribs, yet small and decorative enough so they look like serving utensils and not cooking tools.  They have a nice springy-ness to them that feels sturdy, and the brushed steel finish on them keeps fingerprints from showing.My half star deduction is based completely on personal taste rather than utility.  I would have liked them to be styled more simply without the "cute" X&O cutouts.  I will admit, I'm probably noticing the XO more seeing them side by side - - - when they're actually used and placed on platters scattered around a buffet table, it probably won't be noticed at all.I bought 2 sets of these, along with 2 sets of the vegetable servers (similar, but just about an inch longer) by this same maker and am very happy with all my purchases.
