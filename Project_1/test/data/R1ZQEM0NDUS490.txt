I feel they knew exactly what they were doing when they matched a poorly designed hard drive with an ad campaign that encouraged you to "SAVE YOUR LIFE" on their drives and then set you up to pay huge amounts of money to them to get your data back. I have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Comission about this and hopefully if enough of us do, someone will mount a lawsuit against them. At the very least they should have issued a public recall of this product when they realized it was failing in record numbers. Their 5 year warranty is also a farce since no one in their right mind would want another of these, especially a refurbished one. If you own this drive and it is still working...BACK UP YOUR FILES NOW...if they are still there...it also randomly overwrites files.
