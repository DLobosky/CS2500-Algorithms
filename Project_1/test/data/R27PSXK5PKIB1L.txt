...if you want to print.And even if it's one the most expensive liquids you can buy, printers work better when when you use new cartridges and ink from the printer manufacturer. Amazon offers it at significantly lower price than ordering directly from Epson.This is the higher capacity alternative to the standard size Epson T126 Color Multipack. As for Epson's "extra high capacity" and "ultra extra high capacity" descriptions of the two sizes: you be the judge of how it sounds:-)These install easily in an Epson WorkForce 645.You can't do much about the need to use printer consumables. But comparison shopping can help ease some of the pain of their cost.
