We purchased this book while in Wyoming after we came across the Roadside Wyoming book at Devil's Tower.  The geology so intrigued us and the kids that finding this book in the National Park Service store made our summer trip even more enjoyable. As you travel through Yellowstone, this book is like a personal guide to the geologic features. It goes beyond the typical travel guide explaining the sites since it is from the geologic perspective.  We have purchased other titles in this series after our Wyoming/Yellowstone purchase. Recommended reading as you travel through Yellowstone.
