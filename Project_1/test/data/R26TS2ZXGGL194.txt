With their sleek ombination of soft rock and grand rigeur power ballads, they were a big hit both critically as well as commercially (a big feat for many 1980s' bands) and "Ultimate Air Supply" proves thei mark on music history is still intact.Despite having a few big hits in their native Australia in the 1970s', Air Supply had their first internation success in 1980 with their album "Lost In Love". Selling millions of copies and yielding big hits in the smooth title track, the heartwrenching "All Out Of Love" and the wedding perennial "Every Woman In The World", it put Air Supply on the map both with critics and the public.Their second album, "The One That You Love", proved to be an even greater success, yielding three hit including their only number one, the title track, as well two additional top five hits in the Barry Manilow - esque "Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You) and the sweeping "Sweet Dreams".They suffered a noticable drop in sales with the release of their 1982 album "Now And Forever". Which is not to say the album isn't good. It yielded yet another top five hit and one of their best songs in "Even The Nights Are Better" as well as great minor hits such as "Young Love" and "Two Less Lonely People In The World" (the latter another wedding favorite).Air Supply rebounded with a "Greatest Hits" album released in 1983. It sold over four million copies and yielded a number two smash in the intense Jim Steinman power ballad "Making Love Out Of Nothing At All", which to me is their best song.1985's eponymous album supplied Air Supply with their last significant hit, "Just As I Am", which made the lower section of the top twenty. It is also noticable for the track "The Power Of Love". This song was first recorded by Jennifer Rush, who had a big hit with it virtually everywhere except America. Then Air Supply released it in America, where it became their first single to miss the top sixty. Then the late Laura Branigan released it in America in 1987, and she took it into the top 30. But hte most famous (and definitve) version of the song was Celine Dion's version, which toopped the charts in the U.S. for six weeks. Are we clear? (And, for the record, Air Supply's version is pretty good, too).The last few tracks from their album are from their early 1990s' reunion. In this half of the album, they take a great stab at the Harry Nilsson classic "Without You" (it's tied with Mariah Carey's as third best, after Nilsson's number onehit recording and the 1977 recording by Heart, which I haven't actually heard yet but I bet is good). "Goodbye" and the haunting "Someone" bring the album full circle and look ahead toward the future of this great group."Ultimate Air Supply" also does a fine job at collecting some of their best album tracks that weren't ever singles, such as "I Want To Give It All", "Chances" and the eerie "Don't Be Afraid", the last of which is now considered a tribute to their late arranger Frank Elser-Smith and has killer harmonies.The bottom line is that no cd collection in my opinion would be complete without "Ultimate Air Supply". I recommend it to anyone who has a taste in music or just wants something they could relax to on a long overnight drive or if they want to take a nap. And even if you don't need it for these things, just buy it.
