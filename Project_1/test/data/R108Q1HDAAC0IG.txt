It's a tweak on a 3D version of Mario with little apparent resemblence - but it's there.  You'll spend your time jumping around, squashing bad guys by jumping on them, grabbing upgrades and dodging the occasional enemy fire.It's not a bad thing - not at all.  In fact it looks like a lot of fun, and the new angle of having to paing everything you touch adds a unique element to the game - you finish levels that look nothing like they did when you started them.The controls of De Blob seem to work very well.  The jumping mechanic seems a bit iffy as it seems a number of buildings are placed just slightly higher than you can actually jump.  It forces you to waste some time trying to get somewhere only to finally give up and find another way.  This wouldn't be a problem if the game weren't timed.But even when it comes to running out of time, the game never seems to punish you.  When you run out of time in a challenge (for example, painting a certain number of buildings a certain color) you are given the chance to resume the challenge where you left off.  You get more time, and don't have to start over.  The game simply gives you less points for taking more than one time to finish the challenge.  Even when you run out of time in a level, you simply lose a life and - assuming you have remaining lives - continue playing where you left off.  My wife ended the level with 6 lives, so it seems like you can never really "fail" in De Blob.  This makes it a fantastic game for young children and, well, sore losers, I guess!The only downside I saw right away is the sheer length of levels with no apparent save-point.  This has without doubt already been mentioned several times.  I'm not sure what level my wife was in, but I saw her stay in it for over 2 hours!!  She never even ran out of game-time - she exited the level before the timer (which you're given multiple opportunities to gain more time) ran out.  She's not a die-hard gamer such as myself - after an hour or so she usually gets bored.  I suspect she may never actually finish this game.With a unique twist on a timeless style of video gaming, solid controls and amusing game play, De Blob is sure to be a hit with anyone who has a few hours at a time to "watch the paint dry."
