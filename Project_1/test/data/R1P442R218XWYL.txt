Fans have waited this moment for years. We can buy The Complete Buffy's First Season at last. All the 12 episodes are more then worth the price.Sara Michelle Galler, Angel's introduction in "Angel", the pilot episode "Welcome to Hellmouth", The grate villain The Master (the eldest and strongest vampire of them all), and a lot more inside this 3 disc set. It seems to have good bonus features, and did I mentioned Sara Michele Galler?. Definitely the best TV series after Dark Angel. It has it all, drama, comedy, love stories, action, Sara Michelle Galler kicking the you know what out of the vampires and demons, an amazing writing work (my own personal opinion is that Buffy has one of the best script works in TV production).Every episode without any exception is smart, funny and every actor and actress give their best performance. The adolescence parody that Buffy the Vampire slayer offers is more then accurate for those who understand it. I'm most interested in the Joss Whedon Commentary, I really want to hear his perspective on the interviews about the episodes "Hellmouth,&quot; &quot;The Harvest,&quot; &quot;Witch,&quot; &quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date,&quot; &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Puppet Show".I think I don't have to say much, "it's Buffy" after all, and the name says it all. Finally fans are rewarded for their patience. I just hope season 2, 3, 4, and 5 don't take to long.
