The main character in this book gives us a cynical diatribe against sexual and economical liberalism, wherein men and women are painted as disgusting, decrepit adolescents. They are only searching for more sex, power and influence in the marketplace or taking the necessary measures to assure their dominating position therein. The main targets of his insults are psychiatrists, dentists, bureaucrats and women, although at the end he seeks himself psychological counselling!This book reads like a train. The French title 'Extension du domaine de lutte' suggests that the author intended to portrait a rebel in our modern capitalist society. But his main character becomes disillusioned and leaves the rat race for a peaceful retreat in the countryside!This book gives us a good portrait of the actual working conditions of middle management in a big modern company.A worth-while read.
