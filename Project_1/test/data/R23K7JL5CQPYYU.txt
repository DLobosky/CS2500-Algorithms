I bought the LG 800G to replace an LG 420G that was a backup for my LG 500G. I ordered it from Amazon and the triple minutes for life was the main factor in deciding to get this phone.I used the Tracfone website to transfer the LG 420G phone number, minutes, and days to the LG 800G.  Everything went smoothly and my new phone was up and running in less than an hour after I started the process. I then put in a 200 minute card and it gave me 600 more minutes right away. With tax, the 200 minute card cost $43.18, making the actual cost a little over 7 cents per minute.The LG 800G is smaller than the LG 500G, but the screen is larger.  The 800G virtual QWERTY keypad only works with texting and you have to switch back and forth between kepypads if you want to enter numbers or symbols. The 500G actual keypad is more convenient to use, especially for entering contacts and putting numbers and symbols into texts.When making a call, the 800G keypad locks after three seconds, making it very inconvenient to switch to the speaker phone or enter other data. The 500G is much better while actually on the phone with a call. With the 500G, you have to push and hold the lock button to lock it, while the 800G does it automatically.The 800G has a screen that can be seen outside in bright light, while the 500G is almost impossible to see outside. The 800G touchscreen works just fine for me, although it takes some getting used to.The Internet and camera features are equal on both phones. I don't use any of the apps so I can't comment on those features.The 500G and 800G use the same charger and the same LGIP-430N battery and that is very helpful when you own both phones.As far as the basic features and the convenience of use, I think the 500G is just a little better phone.  However, the triple minutes feature of the 800G is quite superior to the double minutes of the 500G.  If you use up a lot of minutes every day, then the triple minutes of the 800G make it the phone for you.  But, if you only use a phone for basic talking and texting a few minutes a day, then the 500G is the better buy. I really don't think you can go wrong with either one.  They are both excellent phones for the money.Right now, I will continue to use the 500G as my main carry phone and use the 800G as the backup, but I think I could be comfortable using either one on a regular basis.
