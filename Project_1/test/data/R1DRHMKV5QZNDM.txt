I love this video as much as Jane's first step video (Step & Abs).  This one has an intermediate music tempo - around 124 beats per minute.  To me this is wonderful.  Too many modern step videos have tempos as fast as 134 beats per minute!  I just don't believe that's safe.  I love everything about this video, even the music.  I love warming up WITHOUT a step.  You do not stretch before this workout, but you get such an excellent stretch afterwards that I think it's fine.  The stretch portion is excellent!  The whole tape is a perfect length.  As soon as this one comes out on DVD, I will buy it immediately.  It is one of my top 5 favorite step videos that has withstood the test of time.
