Extraordinarily overpriced compared to this vendor's competition.Even so, the others cell this for item (pair) for much more than its apparent c0st of materials and labor. After all, there are only 4 components in these things ! (A spring, a ball bearing, the casing and a bored out casing plug.) Given a couple of more years I expect these items to be a buck or two each. Obviously, China, Inc. (; hasn't yet started manufacturing these things like they were candy, like they do everything else.
