They managed acclaim for their video of Violet and because the female vocals didn't change when singing took place outside the studio. Having gone and seen them live I was impressed by the feeling they brought to the proverbial table as they played with the crowd, and hearing them debut Red Stars and a few other newer songs (Kill the Lights, Looking Glass) showed just what direction they were going in. The direction was a good one, too, and seemed to travel in the same direction The Birthday Massacre had traveled before. Much of it sounded like the tracks that did not make it from Nothing and Nowhere to Violet (if you haven't tried those out you really should), with less of a dark sound and more introspection attached. After a few rotations of the album a few weeks later, I was really pleased with what I had found.Before continuing, I have to say that I really did miss some of the darker songs initially and it biased my opinion at first. Happy Birthday had been one of my favorite songs, and Violet had also been one of those endeared unto me. Chibi has a beautiful voice, though, and listening to Red Stars softened the blow a little and other songs like Science began to grow on me. Kill the Lights and Weekend also made the list and, by the third listen, I saw that this album measured up in ways that Violet didn't. That isn't to say anything bad about Violet at all but to instead say that the preconceived notions I carried as to what the album should be hurt my overall view. If you like The Birthday Massacre and give the album a chance, this will really grow on you. It is a bit different and it is something that you might not expect but it will nonetheless find you. If you did not like the first Birthday Massacre album you might like this one as well, with the transition of sounds leaving a little bit of something for anyone. It has a good beat, female vocals that are really worth trying out, and a range of sounds that move up and down the spectrum.If you need more convincing because you are unsure about the buy, you can check out the samples provided by Metropolis-records.com or on the official Birthday Massacre website.Beautiful work.
