This CD is volume 2 of a two-volume set (each sold separately -- volume 1  is for Rosh Hashanah).  It was originally produced for Public Radio  International in 1996, a year after the broadcast of the Rosh Hashanah  album, and it features the same performers (with both male and female  voices).   The music is done a capella, just as it would be on Yom  Kippur itself. (In consideration of those who feel the Name of God should  not be pronounced except in real worship, the Name is rendered  &quot;Adomai&quot;, with an &quot;M&quot; instead of an &quot;N.&quot;)   From the opening with a soulfelt &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; to the closing  shofar blast, this is a liturgical CD that will open your heart to God.  I  especially liked the Sephardic version of &quot;Chatanu lefanecha&quot;,   as well as the more familiar versions of &quot;Ki Anu Amecha&quot; and  Avinu Malenu.&quot;   Each liturgical piece is introduced by Nimoy,  reading an inspirational script written by Rabbi Gerold Skolnik.  These  introductions set the proper mood and make the spirit of the service  accessible even to those listeners who don't know any Hebrew.  The  narrations are recorded on separate tracks so, if you just want to listen  to the music the next time around, you can program your CD player to skip  the commentaries.  The CD comes with photos and notes on the various  cantors, the meaning of each liturgical piece, and background info on the  composers. Together, the  two &quot;Birthday of the World&quot; albums make  a  fine set for the High Holy Day season.
