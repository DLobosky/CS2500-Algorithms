We read labels and do not buy anything that is unhealthy. Like the reviewer Beth said, other brands have hydrogenated oil in them but not Tumaros! Finally, a flour tortilla that I can serve without hesitation. They make delicious cheese quesadillas for a quick lunch, dinner, or snack. Create easy soft tacos and burritos. Also make wonderful wraps for a healthy lunch or a breakfast on the go. Glad to see these back again, Amazon. Highly recommended!
