We have a mix of the overlords, consortium, new serpents (with their own internal strife) and the redoubt crew saving the day - while wrecking almost everything in site. Lots of action, from Domi's hand-to-hand with a poison spitting foe to Kane, Bridget, and Grant battling flying saucers. Lakesh fighting to same snake royalty, and Nantes running amok (and introducing yet another potential foe into the mix.)One of the most inventive in the series so far, and a book I actually enjoyed reading.  Come on - this is Outlanders, not Moby Dick or Hamlet. This series is pulp - no more, no less. Mindless entertainment.  In that, it delivers. :)
