I got these for a friend of mine as a gift and he loves them. They get the ball teed to the right height for him and they're easy to find after the shot due to the bright yellow color. He plays 2-3 times a week and can get a pair to last a year for him. The downside is the brush bristles tend to splay out over time so after about 3-4 months it can be a challenge to get the ball to stay on the tee. This is the reason I don't use them but that's the only flaw that I can see.
