Beavis and Butthead was a low brow cartoon and proud of it. The Maxx came along at the same time as these shows and it delved more into story and character development than any other before or after. And being a short series at that. The Maxx was originally a comic book created by Sam Keith, and it was his brainchild. From that comic came a very strange and different story that delved more into questions than answers. You have a hero and villain both with mysterious origins who steps between two different worlds. The comic kept you asking which world was real, along with other questions to be answered by the end of the series. The television series captured much of the same vibe as the cartoon (and the freaky artwork), which is why there is a lot of love for the show. I'll be the first to tell you that if you are a stickler for high quality animation this show won't be up to snuff. They take a ton of shortcuts animation-wise to the point of seeing a fair amount of scenes with a still image moving in front of a static background. Add to that a little mix of CGI and live action shadows to make the format even more eclectic. This may sound like a bad thing, but in fact all of this only lends more style to an already artistically stylish cartoon. Trust me. The animation/art style something many of you have never seen before and it's great for that. The story is not quite as convoluted as the comic book, but it's very close. While some of the comic's questions aren't all that hard to answer early on in the TV series that in no way lessens the tangled web Sam Keith put together. You will still weave through the show with little details like who is The Maxx? What is the Outback (the alternate world)? Who is Mr. Gone and why is he doing what he is doing? Where does Julie fit into all of it? The show is good with all this even when it gets weird. Being born of a comic book one of the things those of us who previously read the book wondered about the dialog and audio. Would it fit what we imagined the characters sounded like? Would the dialog fall flat when actually spoken? Well rest assured they found the perfect voice actors for their parts. The Maxx sounds like a gruff-tough hero type while at the same time personally reflective. Mr. Gone sounds menacing and sage. Julie and Sara come off with the right indignance in their voices. Back when the comic was out they made a cassette audio book of the first few issues. I never heard it so I have no idea whether or not the voice acting is similar (anybody know?). Music is sparse so much of the background sound is just that. Little noises of the environment that fill out the visuals and dialog. All in all it works very well. There is a question I have about this DVD that I wanted to address and hopefully will get answered for all of us. MTV previously released the show on VHS, but it wasn't complete. Part of episode 8 was cut due to licensing issues. Basically the original comic was published by Image Comics and they had a crossover issue using a bad guy from another Image comic. Well a different version of that villain ended up in the TV show, but apparently the copyright holders didn't get what they wanted to have that segment appear on video (MTV stingy with royalties?). I want to know if that missing footage is going to show up on this DVD. People are saying the video quality is not that great and practically HVS quality so there is a lack of mastering here as well. There are interviews and commentaries on the episodes so that's something. The Maxx is an excellent 12 episode animated series and it deserves to get some additional exposure. It's sad that the initial DVD release comes down to a "we'll burn you a copy if you order one" format and not an unedited, remastered one with sweet extras kind of send off. At least now you can get a legit copy instead of bootlegs.
