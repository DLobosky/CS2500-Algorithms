This book has it all: humor, pathos, lovable characters, original plot, colorful storytelling, fresh writing, the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement for depth.....but what made this book a publishing phenomenon?Our library fiction book discussion group read it and many participants said it was a "page-turner" and they were on the edge of their seats while reading it, but couldn't figure out why.  We've read other books about the South and black and white relationships, but they didn't have the universal appeal or page-turning quality as this book did.  What made this book different?A writing instructor told our writing-lit class at NYU that in classic story structure, books need a "page-turning mechanism" which is a central conflict that is "personal, concrete, and specific."  It's not enough that Elizabeth Bennett wants a husband in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE he said.  It's when Mr. Darcy comes on the scene that the pace quickens: Darcy is concrete, specific and personal. Mysteries/thrillers fill the best-seller lists because they have a central conflict that is personal, specific and concrete: a dead body.  There's nothing more concrete than a dead body, my instructor Adam pointed out in our classes and in this book: (Master Class in Fiction Writing: Techniques from Austen, Hemingway, and Other Greats.  It's not a coincidence that Agatha Christie has sold more fiction books than any author in history.Did THE HELP have such a concrete and personal central conflict in addition to the maids' stories, the Junior League tales, the lovable and despicable characters and intriguing plot points?  Yes, it does. Now, if you haven't read the book yet, stop here and go read it.  If you've read it, you'll recognize at the heart of the story the protagonist (Skeeter) sets off on her own heroes journey to write the maids' stories, and tell the world of their plight. Skeeter needs to get the stories to the New York publisher by a deadline before her family and community find out or the Klu Klux Klan prevents her or the maids. It's the heroes quest: get the manuscript which is concrete to the publisher by a concrete deadline without getting found out and possibly killed.  You realize their very lives are at risk--now the book has the dynamics of a thriller.  They are living in a police state in which the police and system are not on the side of justice.  At one point while Skeeter is at a maid's house, they hear a truck nearby--has the Klu Klux Klan discovered them?  Your heart palpitates a bit.If Skeeter is successful in getting the maids' story out to the nation in which attitudes are different than in the South, you feel the system has a possibility for radical change. Skeeter and the maids can affect history.  These dynamics elevate the book from merely being a poignant account of black-white relationships in the South.  It now has the dynamics of suspense and the heroes journey which we all relate to as we're on one in our own lives to an equal or lesser degree.  The backdrop of the Civil Rights movement only intensifies the meaningfulness of what is at stake and contextualizes the book as part of that epic struggle for freedom, justice and the pursuit of happiness--our most fundamental and universal desires and rights. The blacks in the South couldn't access these--through Skeeter's and the maids' efforts, maybe they would begin to be able to. This is a story that is universal in its attraction as sales of this book attest to.
