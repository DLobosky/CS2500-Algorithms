This was fun, funny, silly, and still had some serious moments that many people are facing--divorce, little money, bickering about the little things in life, wanting more "stuff" or the grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side feelings.It is a heartwarming movie, but not as predictable as most.  Again, around 85-90 minutes running time, so short enough to play without committing to a marathon of movie watching.  I did not recognize any of the actors in this, which makes it easier for me to watch sometimes because I'm not looking at the actor as much as the story.Like A Nanny for Christmas, this is very tame, but I would rate it PG only because very young kids might not enjoy it.  Also good for 8 years old and up, I'd say, but nothing too adult if there are young kids walking through the room--no profanity, no nudity, no politics, just a simple Christmas movie.  I'd say kind of a cross between It's a Wonderful Life and Cinderella.  Another fun movie for a slumber party for young preteens and teens.  Also a safe movie to show during family gatherings since most people have probably never seen it before.
