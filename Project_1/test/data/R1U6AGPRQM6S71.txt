Some co-workers of mine purchased this book several years ago and read it aloud during their lunch hour. They would make comments that they couldn't wait until lunch time the following day to be able to read more, as the book kept them on the edge. After listening to them for several days, I ordered the book, and I could not put it down! The author's incredible imagination keeps the mystery going all the way to the end of the book, making it extremely unpredictable, which is crucial for a good mystery!! Great book -- highly recommend it.  I am now reading Michael Frase's The Last Goodbye, which has been fantastic so far!
