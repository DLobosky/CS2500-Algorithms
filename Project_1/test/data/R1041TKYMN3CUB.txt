I am so happy and pleased that I did.Pros:  1.  Set-Up:  Literally, without reading the provided Quick-set up guide, I turned the unit on and within literally seconds it found the internet networks, including mine.  I inputted my password, and within seconds, I was downloading a software update.  After that the unit turned on and I literally was listening to music from the Netherlands within 5 minutes of the arrival of the package.  How easy is that?2.  Aesthetic:  I opted for the basic black model.  It is probably the size of a substantial clock radio.  The speaker cover is on the left, with the large tuning dial most prominent, along with the screen.  It is a very nice looking unit, and from the looks perspective, it seems that the unit is very nice-looking.3. Sound:  Okay, this is not a hi-fi stereo system.  However, I found the sound to be quite good and better than I thought.  Surprisingly good sound and for most volumes.  Yes, not a party system, but room-filling is not a stretch.4.  Use:  I found that it takes only a few seconds for the internet stations to load and play, actually very little delay involved at all.  The unit displays the time and date in a format which you can pick, which is very cool.  And, should you opt for it, you can display Flickr pictures, or other sources (I haven't messed with that quite yet).  I have found that the unit does NOT lose touch with the internet after hours of listening.Finding stations is quite easy on the unit itself, there are plenty of stations available worldwide.  Plus, you can load stations through [...].  I added some personal favorites from Europe - awesome!  Bottom line - very easy to use and I daresay intuitive.5.  Remote control: this is a separate feature for purchase.  However, you can log into your unit via a computer with the software and control your radio- COOL! Also, you can get a download called Ipeng, which allows your Itouch to control the Squeezebox.  Very well-worth it.6.  [...]:  this is the website for  allowing you to add services like Pandora, Rhapsody and others to you radio.  Easy to use and very smartly done. Neutral:1.  Minor quibbles:  I wish there were more pre-set stations (your given 6), but this is a fairly small unit, keep in mind.  2.  Alarms:  I don't think you should but this for a reliable alarm clock, that would be like buying a car for using the stereo.  That being said, it does have alarms, but they were the only thing I couldn't really understand how to gear up without some understanding.  And as far as whether the sound is adequate, I have no idea actually - haven't heard it yet.3.  Sleep:  I do wish the sleep function was a more direct route to locate (and perhaps it is if I mess with the system more adequately), but it is not an easily locatable feature, and having the ability to have the unit to shut off easily is a cool feature.4.  Using this with your existing Itunes or other music on computers is fairly easy to set-up, but it is not the easiest of tasks with this unit like everything else.  I did get it to work, but it does take some effort.  Perhaps as I get into this unit more, I can adapt it for this purpose.  It did see my music without much effort, however.5.  No battery pack available yet as of April, 2010.Cons:1.  None, really so far.  I am very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to explore even more music from around the world!In short, this thing rocks and is extremely cool.    If you thinking of a internet radio, you can't go wrong with this unit!
