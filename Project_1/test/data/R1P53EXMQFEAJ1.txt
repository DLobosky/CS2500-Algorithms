The girl even has a decent command of English. She's STILL a work in progress (even on her follow-up), and will only improve. And improvement on THIS will be WOW!!Same 15 tracks, in the same order; a bonus #16, which is a remix of #3, "malemolencia". Same great sound. Jewel case, rather than cardboard, if you care. Notes all in Portugese, which I can't read. Great album. Do you "need" this? The American version is cheaper, more easily available, and is the same work. Five stars, of course, but your call...
