The book reads really good. It is a whole lot like US Grant's autobiography. If you wondered why George Bush did this or that this book will answer that question. You will learn things that did not come out during his administration. It is written in such a way you feel like you are sitting down with the President, drinking coffee and he is telling you stories. You get to know the why he made decisions; what was going through his mind. The book does do a good job of explaining the why. You will see the impact of staff, upbringing, education, family and other things on leaders decision. That becomes very easy to see in the book. I think this book will answer some questions. It covers what the White House Communications office didn't do back in his administration.  A good read for all.
