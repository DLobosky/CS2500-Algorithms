The see through portion is thicker than I thought it would be.  The sides and backing are sturdier than I thought they'd be.  The writing and graphics are apple green.  (If you can't tell that from the photos, let me be the first to inform you.... they are green).What I DON'T LIKE about this cover:  While you can, with your fingernail, turn the DX on through the top of the cover (i.e. without opening the cover) it's not easy to do.  This is not so much a design flaw as an inconvenience.  They can't have a hole up there if the device is supposed to be kept safe from splashes, BUT, an indicater as to where the on off button is and perhaps a thinner fabric in that area might help.  Then again, if you jam your fingernail into the cover to turn it on and off, eventually, I think you'll bore a little hole in it, and that won't be good.    I also find that operating the five way mouse is more difficult, obviously, through the skin of the cover.  It takes some getting used to, but it's an imperfect system.  Mistakes can and will be made with the operation of the mouse through the fabric.What is rather AMAZING about this cover is that it does a crazy excellent job of protecting the DX.  We used a calculator for a demonstration and sealed it within the case.  We spritzed it with water, had a dog with wet paws walk on it, dropped it in a filled sink, dropped dirt on it, dropped pet hair on it, purposely spilled a beverage next to it and then on it, got out of the shower and dripped on it, and not one molecule of water, dander, hair, or dirt made it into the case.  We used a calculator so as to not actually damage the DX if, for some reason, the cover failed.  It didn't fail.  So, here's the bottom line - If you want a case that's easy to get the Kindle DX in and out of, that allows operation of the Kindle DX while it's inside, protects the Kindle from liquid and other debris, and doesn't increase the weight of the device and only minimally adds to the thickness - this is a good cover.If you want a stand, or fashion colors, or something that also houses a pad of paper, or something that people in a coffee house will ooo and aahhh over - then you should buy a different case.If you think that the difficulty of operating the power switch or being able to have your headphones in the top while it's completely shut will be a problem - don't buy this case.If you are annoyed by the slightest inconvenience when it comes to operating the five direction mouse - don't buy this case.If you are mainly interested in a protective cover that you can read through that will stop damage if someone spills coffee on you or it starts to rain and you want to shove it in your bag or under your shirt, this is a good case.Finally, I would like to point out that I often leave the top of the case open when I'm reading (meaning I don't seal it completely) in a place where it isn't going to rain, there are no beverages or wet dogs, and no chance of odd or abrasive substances - and I find I don't have a problem with the off/on switch, then.  I'm after protection that doesn't cost a fortune.  So this fits the bill. 4 Stars because of the mouse operation and power button issue.
