I thought I knew. . . but after first ordering the Standard edition, and finding out what is not included, I returned it and ordered the "Preferred" edition.  Now I wish I had stuck with the Standard edition, for a lot less $$. Second, I think you need to think about exactly how you are going to use this software, and that too will help you decide upon which edition you might purchase.  Here are some items which are NOT included with the Standard edition but ARE included with the Preferred edition (list came from the side of the box I received)~~~~ * Microsoft Excel * Automatically transcribe recordings from handheld digital recorders, Pocket PC's or Palm Tungsten * Wireless microphone support, including Bluetooth * Includes Nuance RealSpeak for turning text into human-sounding speech * Play back your dictation for easier correction and proofing * Insert your signature, logo or boilerplate text with a simple voice command * Import/export your user files to use on any PC with Dragon Naturally Speaking. ~~~~~Here's my review. .  . .. . I have been using this product, off and on, for a little over a month now.  Here's my take on it. . . . If you are either a slow typist, or have a disability which does not allow you to type, then I think that this software is probably going to be helpful for you.  The box says that most people type no more than 40 words per minute.  I type over twice that.  I use this software when I want to send a letter to a friend.  I would not use this for business purposes.  You spend a lot of time correcting and "training" the system.  I find far fewer mistakes when I'm typing it myself than when I'm using this software.  But again, I type relatively fast.  Having spent a LOT of extra money to purchase the "Preferred" edition, I really wish I had stuck with the "Standard" edition.  Using it for Excel (not available on the Standard edition)  is cumbersome at best, and being that often times numbers are so important in spreadsheets, it's quite "error prone" and correcting a lot of numbers in a spreadsheet is not fun.  Again, I'm not really knocking the software.  I think it does a relatively good job overall, and I'm sure that if you take the time to make all of the corrections it gets better. .  .. but. . . I think if you type fast to begin with, you're probably not going to be too happy with this software.  Unless the above "extras" included in the Preferred edition are really worth a lot to you, I would recommend the Standard edition and save yourself some $$. Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Standard
