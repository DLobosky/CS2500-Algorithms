I've really enjoyed using this monitor. I got another model of MultiSync monitor about 6 months ago, and was very pleased with that, so I saw no reason to switch brands when I discovered I needed another LCD monitor.I've used this monitor on my PC running Windows 98, and then Windows XP. (I later upgraded to XP.) I've also used it on a PowerMac G4 (connected to the VGA port), which runs both OS X and OS 9. It works well with both of these Macintosh Operating Systems. The screen is bright and clear. When I ran the Windows update in XP, it immediately found a recent driver for this monitor. That was nice.It is best to set this monitor at its &quot;native&quot; resolution of 1024 x 768 -- if you set it for 800 x 600 (or lower) the monitor &quot;reminds&quot; you periodically that it is not set at its &quot;best&quot; setting. This warning will keep popping up and while I assume there's a way to make it go away permenantly, it is a little irritating. So, be warned if you want to use this monitor at anything other than 1024 x 768. Actually, all LCD monitors are the same in this regard -- they don't *want* to be set at any other resolution other than their &quot;native&quot; resolution. The sharpness will not be as good on any LCD monitor if it's not at its &quot;native&quot; resolution. That's just the nature of LCD.All I can say is that setting up this monitor has been trouble-free. It is a slim and lightweight monitor with a bright screen. An absolute joy. Very cross-platform! I am quite pleased with it.
