I am a Graphic Designer and have been using Macs at work for years, and have always wanted one at home. The PowerMac Dual 2.3 is quite fast, much more so than my old DELL with a 3.02 GHz Pentium 4 with HT. While it is fast, Apple is skimpy with the standard RAM; 512mb is the absolute least you should have in this machine. Thankfully, adding additional ram is simple and cheap.MAC OS X 10.4 Tiger is an awesome operating system; everything looks great, and runs smoothly. No crashes, no viruses, and no worries that something you've been working on for the last 2 hours will be lost if you forget to save. Almost all of the necessary programs are available for MAC as well; Microsoft Office, most Adobe products, and Quicken. Also, the iLife suite of software that came with system is great. The Mighty Mouse is very useful with the additional buttons, and it is still an elegant Apple design.My only caveats are with the size of the system. It is quite large, and just barely fits on my desk. However, with all that power under its beautiful aluminum hood that's to be expected I guess.Overall, I love the Macintosh operating system, and the PowerMac G5. After using them at work for so many years and loving them, I am so glad I finally replaced my home computer with an Apple PowerMac G5.Also, buy one now before they switch to Intel, there are sure to be problems when they first switch over, and regardless of the advertised GHz speed, I cannot see the new systems being much faster than the IBM PowerPC chips.About the Intel switch.Recently a friend of mine said he had the ability to try a prototype Mac with the new Intel chips. He said the chip was a dual core 4.0 Ghz in a PowerMac. He felt that the system performance seemed no faster that the current G5 PowerPC chip. One more reason not to wait for Intel.
