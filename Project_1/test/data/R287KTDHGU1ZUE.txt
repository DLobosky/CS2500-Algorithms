It was very impressive actually, and after watching the making of video I know why. They actually took the time to set the camera shots up so that each shot was taken twice, roughly each eye of a 9 inch figurine. What does that mean? It means that if gives you the view as if you were one of those 9 inch tall character in the movie. Beautiful attention to detail makes this a wonderful movie. When I watched this movie in 2D afterwards it did not feel the same, it took out the element of being in the story. It was the same TV but it did not feel like the movie I watched in 3D. The sharpness of detail was not as apparent. If you are looking for a well done 3d movie to add to the very small collection of 3d movies available, this one may be right for you. The story was good, and the 3d is very well done. Not too much of the in your face 3d effects, more of an enhancing of the overall experience.
