Taka, a spy for the British, is supposed to kill Summer, an American girl.  He plans to kill her, but keeps delaying it.  The bad guys, a religious cult, also want to kill her, but Taka keeps saving her from them.  It is full of suspense, danger, and a couple of sex scenes.  The sex scene on page 323 is great!  There is a happy ending.  This is the third book in her "Ice" series.  I loved it.  Sexual content:  strong.
