That seems to be the motto of the movie, until something terrible happens. a kidnapping turns into a babysitting job that involves a man that cannot hear, and that evolves into a tragedy that makes everything so much more than green. With the accident found out and a fahter's wrath on the loose, a few things begin to happen. People who have some necrotic desires find themselves falling on sharpened blades, batteries seem unchecked until they hook to ears that don't really seem to like this new designer wardrobe, and a knife does things to a person's leg that are horrific to check out. all the while other plots play out, like one involving terroists, a few involving electroshock, and some that involve near-misses. Its certainly not a beautiful day in that neighborhood.Of the three revenge movies, this was the first I had the joy of watching and the one that makes me cringe the most. It has a graphicness to it that makes the torment all-the-more realistic, and the people that are being tortured seem to go that extra mile. That's one thing I can say about the direction here - the body reacts in ways you would expect it to react when put under certain stressors, and this is enough to make you cringe. Place that with the understanding of why the money is needed, what was supposed to happen versus what turns out to be the case, and how terrible the person feels in this and you have a perfectly tortured soul added to the fray. Honestly, i felt sorrow for quite a few of the people in this movie, something I'm not accustomed to feeling, and that told me that the movie was doing a great job. It also pointed out how accidents happen and how little things can become big things when the world spins out-of-control.If you liked Old boy or simply like a good revenge movie with a nice plot, then this will suit you. It has all the staples that a person would want from a nice movie of this kind, including the speed of the movie and the terrible things that befall each and every person in the film. It has no winners - that's another good thing I think people might appreciate, knowing that forgiveness is not a solution and that revenge has its price as well. The one thing I think I have to not is that it is grapic, extremely so in some cases, adn that should be known ahead of time. Still, in movies like this, you expect alittle terror to mingle with your tragedy. This is highly recommended.
