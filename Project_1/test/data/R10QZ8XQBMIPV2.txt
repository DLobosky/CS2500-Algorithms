I lived there for the next nine years exactly, moving out on my 17th birthday, and spent six days a week in the library next door (except for that brief period when I was banned for having 77 overdue books, and had to work off my fines before they'd let me back in).  I'd have been in there seven days a week except they were closed on Sunday, which has ever since been my least favorite day of the week.There were several children's librarians there during the years I lived next door, and they all took an interest in me as I was such a voracious reader.  One gave me a copy of The Animal Family as a birthday present one year, and it immediately became my favorite book.This story is so simply told, yet so beautiful that it has stayed with me all my life (30 years and counting since I first read it).  Before the internet came along, I made it a point to locate used copies through the booksellers' network, and kept several copies on hand so that I could give them away whenever I met a special child who I thought would appreciate it.You can read the other reviews if you want to know the story line... nothing can do it justice, however, except just reading the book.  When you start, you won't want the story to end, and when it does, you will be sad that things the world - families and relationships - aren't really as beautiful, simple and loving as they are in the book.This is an absolute MUST READ for any child.  Or adult.
