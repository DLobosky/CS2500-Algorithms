I got the 1080P version of this monitor with the exact same base.  It was very unstable and tipped over, shattering the screen, which is quite fragile (unlike our LCD computer screens).  I checked several models in the store with this base and they were all very unstable compared to other brands.Either wall mount this or keep it somewhere it won't get bumped at all.  Since many (if not most) people will use the base stand it comes with, I thought this was important to let people know.  Very disappointed in this design.
