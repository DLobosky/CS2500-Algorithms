Each episode is based on a story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930) who wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Sherlock Holmes.(1) The Blue Carbuncle (12 scenes; based on the 1892 story).A diamond with a "sinister history" is stolen from a wealthy widow.  Sherlock discovers it in a most unlikely place and has to figure out who put it there.(2) The Copper Beeches (10 scenes; based on the 1892 story).An oddball employer asks a would-be female employee to accept some mysterious conditions before being hired for a lucrative job in a mansion called "The Copper Beeches."  The quotation from Sherlock that is the title of this review is from this episode.Brett (who made 41 Sherlock Holmes' dramas between 1984 and 1994) is in top-form in these two episodes since they were made before the time of his health problems.  He captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performances. The costumes, background music, and cinematography are quite well done.  In my case, I found the picture quality and sound quality of this DVD to be practically perfect.Finally, this DVD has 3 extras.  I found these interesting.  Newcomers to the series should especially enjoy them.In conclusion, be sure to view this DVD and see why it won a 1988 Swedish Academy of Detection Award!!(1984;  100 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)+++++
