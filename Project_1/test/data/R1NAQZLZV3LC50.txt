LewisI was very young, when one of my favorite teachers started reading "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," which is the first book I read in the series. I was so dissapointed when the teacher read right up to the part about getting through the wardrobe and then stopped. She never got around to finishing the story...but later I did.This is a story of four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, who are sent into the country to live with Professor Kirke because of the air-raids on wartime London. On their first morning, the weather is awful, so they play indoors. "What's that noise?" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning to make her feel a little creepy. --The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeLucy finds a "wardrobe" with a door hidden in the back. Because The wardrobe is actually a magical door to Narnia and she enters a snowy magical world filled with talking animals. I was just fascinated when the teacher read this: ... And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air ... The Magician's Nephew is my second favorite book. Voyage of the Dawn Treader is perhaps the most memorable because of all delicious imagery and talk of the sea. I loved Reepicheep the Valiant Mouse, he was so cute but so brave. There are tales of magic books, sea adventures and someone naughty turns into a scary dragon (great lesson). To find out if they stay a dragon you have to read the books and I won't spoil the ending for you. All I can tell you is that when you start reading these books time won't stand still as it does when these children jump into a picture and start an adventure aboard the Dawn Treader. These books are nothing short of magical. The imagination of Lewis is so powerful that the numerous images become a part of you and you remember them forever. Through the books, C.S. Lewis weaves the morals and beliefs children need to learn. Aslan, the Lion, has great significance. I will always thank the teacher who introduced these books to me, wherever she may be! This set is of high quality and the pictures are now in color! I could not imagine not reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe first. That just makes the stories so magical from the very start.~The Rebecca Review
