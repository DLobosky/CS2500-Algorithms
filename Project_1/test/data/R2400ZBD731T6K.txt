The Stansfield/Elrod outline remains as comprehensive as any of the intro to genetics textbooks currently available.  At about 10-15% the cost of the &quot;standard&quot; texts, this outline delivers the same material with more clarity, and often more accuracy.  The concepts of classical genetics, which often prove more challenging for students than molecular aspects, are covered admirably in this book.  While those who enjoy colorful illustration and pastel text boxes might be disappointed, the b&amp;w figures in this book are extremely clear, logical and most importantly helpful towards learning the material.  No solution manual or supplemental CD-ROM is required.  Highly recommended as a reference, or as a text for general genetics classes.
