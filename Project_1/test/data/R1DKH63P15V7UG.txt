This movie was part of my free Comcast 3D package at this price the movie was very much worth it. I was actually considering to buy this movie until I noticed that it was part of my package with my cable provider.The movie is good with enjoyable content and the 3D effects are fun, my only issue with the movie was the transfer to 2D content much of the time. The best 3D scenes were underwater and somewhat limited. The waves scenes had a lot of 2D content and that kind of became frustrating when I was trying to show of the new TV to some friends, deff not a movie to show of your new system, for that try Tangled or Owls, maybe Haunted Castle.Like I say at this point we have a limited amount of 3D content and I think all movies are worth it for the right price, that said I think anything $15 and under is a good price point for this movie.Feel free to read my other reviews, I am trying to review as much 3D material as possible. It's a little frustrating that not that many people are reviewing 3D movies at this time.BTW the best 3D movie I've seen at home is [...] but the problem is that I don't think they make it on blue ray, I saw it through my cable provider. The movie itself is not that good, but the 3D special effects are mind blowing.
