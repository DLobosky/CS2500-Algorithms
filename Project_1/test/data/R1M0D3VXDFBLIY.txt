First the clay animation facial movement was very believable.  The musicals were not over the top and magical.  The soundtracks bleed gothic love.  The story while quiet short and predictable but was smooth and perfect.  I am not sure why other thought the "Nightmare before Christmas" was better.  I found that movie way over acted and stereo-typing, while this one was quiet believable even if the plot is a dead bride.  The concept would still work well with other situations replacing the dead bride.  Yes the acting and the scenes are cold, but it is gothic.  Why this movie got five stars, it was one of the few movies that are quite saddening.
