I've read many of his books cover to cover. Rick makes them fun and easy to read as well as packing in a wealth of information the other guide books just never cover. He tells you what you have to see in the area and then what he would veer off the beaten path for. We've taken his advice over and over again and he never disappoints. He'll take you to those small towns where authentic old Europe still exists and where you can truly relax. I can't recommend his books enough. We've had life altering moments on vacation that would not have occurred if we hadn't taken his advice to stray off the well-beaten tourist path. I highly recommmend the Italy, England and this Germany/Austria book. Reutte, Austria is a slice of heaven - don't tell anyone.
