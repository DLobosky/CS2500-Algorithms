This was my intro to Trivium and what an intro it was.  I actually got it at Barnes and Noble and listened to some song samples there.  Well I was hooked and was pleasantly surprised that I could find Metal of this caliber at a bookstore.  I bought it and listened to it again and again since.  Parts of the album remind me of Dark Tranquillity, and some of the vocals remind me of Phil Anselmo's voice from Pantera.  But those are not complaints.  Trivium has a fresh sound that manages to be original throughout.  If you are a Heavy Metal fan I urge you to check out this album.  It's pretty damn sweet!
