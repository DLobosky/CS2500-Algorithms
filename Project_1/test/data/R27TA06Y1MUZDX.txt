The Apple keyboard's width appears to be almost 2 inches less than the Microsoft keyboard. It is also thinner and a little lighter. The Apple keyboard is still plenty comfortable for touch typing.From what I've been able to see the function keys on the Apple keyboard work on the iPhone - volume controls, screen brightness, play/pause, ff, rew -- all work as expected. The Expose and Dashboard keys don't seem to have any effect.I still like the Microsoft keyboard and for heavy use, would probably still choose it. For portability, style, and iPhone compatibility, the Apple wireless keyboard has the edge is probably the winner for my purposes. My only quibble with the Apple keyboard is that it lacks PC keys that I would miss if used often with a computer - PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, Ins.To sum up, I think either this Microsoft keyboard or the Apple wireless keyboard are good choices. If portability is paramount, I'd go with the Apple keyboard. I could easily imagine using it on an airplane tray table, for example. For heavier use, I prefer the ergonomic curve and more standard PC layout of the Microsoft keyboard.The big loser in my roundup is the FreedomPro folding keyboard which in terms of total volume is not much bigger than the Apple keyboard, is not stiff enough when unfolded for typing on your lap, and just is not very good for touch typing.
