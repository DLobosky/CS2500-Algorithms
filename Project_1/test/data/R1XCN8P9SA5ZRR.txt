Here are some guideposts to look out for:This story is told by Huck, and is not in the classic shape of a novel.  Rather it is a precursor to Ulysses and Remembrance of Things Past, where other great writers attempted to capture the essence of our internal  dialogue.Huck is also hiding a lot from himself.  You as the reader can  quickly see through him, though.  He is trying to put a brave and positive  face on a very dangerous situation.  We all do that.Huck also has to  face himself before the book ends.  What really is important?  We can all  spout a lot of moral talk, but what we do is critical.  If we lived in  Huck's times, we would also see that there was an emormous moral dilemma.   The rules of humanity were often not applied to black people.  You could  choose to go along and feel like a hypocrite (if you thought about what you  were doing), or you could do the right thing.  Sensitive people of that day  often found it hard to do the right thing.  If your neighbors were  open-minded and you lived in the North, you might do one thing.  If your  neighbors were slaveholderes and lived in the South, you might do  another.Also, think about the trip down the river as an analogy for  going through life.  How will it turn out if you just let your direction go  with the current?
