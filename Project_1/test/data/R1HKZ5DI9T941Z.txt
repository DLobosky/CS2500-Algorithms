

For All The Tea in China is a quick and entertaining read. We get a fairly detailed description of two of Fortune's trips into China, as well as a few anecdotes about his other travels. There are some interesting asides discussing green and black tea as well as the Taiping Rebellion.When I reached the end of the book, I felt like there were several missing chapters. Very little detail is provided on the transit between China and India. While Rose describes in detail the failure of the first crop of tea plants, she gives very little information about how plantations finally became successful.
