Within a week, I could not stop listening to it and listened to it every day for at least 2 months. It is now one of my favourite albums.When I first heard "Battle Studies" -- a casual listen after coming home with the CD -- my reaction was that it was like an average 80's pop album, which describes the cover art perfectly, too. At just over 30 years old, is he already nostalgic for the 80s?I have already given it a few more listens and it is growing on me. I am starting to appreciate each of the tracks on their own merits. It is growing on me. The subleties of the guitar work are revealing themselves.The most important thing is that he is not standing still. This is not a rehash of any of his former work. It has the cohesiveness of an album, but the overall feel of an experiment. "Continuum" was a great album but was spacious. There is more going on all at once here. I have a feeling that his next album will benefit greatly from what he tried here. Until then, this one will do.**UPDATE:I have now listened to the album a great deal over the past few days, and my conclusion is now that it's an excellent album. I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.Here are some thoughts on select tracks:ASSASSINS: I am surprised this song is generally being met with either indifference or dislike. I think it is one of the best tracks on the album. It does have some Seal-like pervasive background vocals, but I really like the aggressive guitar backing on this track.HALF OF MY HEART: I don't mind this track, but the Taylor Swift mention is trivial and redundant. She sings two lines -- the same line twice -- on the whole track. It's almost as if they were thinking "how can we get Taylor Swift on this track for a front cover mention without having her presence wreck the song?". They could have put a guitar swoon in place of her lines and it might have been better.CROSSROADS: I have never heard the original, but it sounds like a song with some soul turned into a straightforward pop track. It isn't out of place on the album, but it's weird that he would go to all efforts to make his own music so involved and then go so sparse with this one. The main guitar track has been so processed by effects that it ends up sounding a bit like a clavinet. Weird. Still, I like some of the other guitar work in this one.The whole album is great for repeat listening. He knows what he is doing in that regard. There is enough variation (if subtle) that it doesn't get tiring when put on repeat... even all day, in my case.The overall sound quality seems different from that of "Continuum" to me. The latter seemed spacious and bright, but this one sounds compressed and subdued. It is like a more mellow version of the "Heavier Things" sound quality.I am also glad he is good at editing his own material. That is, he has not fallen into that trap of filling up the CD with all of the scraps lying around. There's no filler, really, and I wouldn't want to skip any of them. It's a tight, cohesive album.If I had only listened to this album once, I would have walked away and given it 3 stars. I am glad I took the time to get to know it better.
