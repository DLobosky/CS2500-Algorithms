The bag is gorgeous. The container and utensil set fit perfectly inside the bag. It is padded, which provides some insulation to help keep food cool. The three tiered container is held together by two large clips on the outside. They are easy to open and close, but they hold all three containers together well. The containers themselves are held together by several more clips which are just as easy to open and close. The containers easily stack on top of each other. The small container is perfect for salad dressing, yogurt, or any other side condiment. The bamboo utensils come in a recycled plastic material (unless you order the red or black cotton) pouch that snaps shut. The utensils are sturdy, large in size, and consist of a fork, spook, knife, and set of chopsticks. I really love this set. I like it better than my Mr. Bento. I can put it in the dishwasher. It does not not leach chemicals, stain, or take on odors of food that I put in it. If I had seen this one first, I would have bought this instead of the bento. Highly recommend this. This is also cheaper than the two tier tiffin set!
