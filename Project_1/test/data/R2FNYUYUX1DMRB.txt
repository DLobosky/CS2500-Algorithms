I've been a James Bond since I was 5 years old. I've idolized the very idea of the man since I was a kid, and now to see him in all incarnations in the way he is meant to be seen is a treat.Volume One gives you five Bond films: 1964's "Goldfinger" (the best Bond movie), 1971's cheesy but highly enjoyable "Diamonds Are Forever", 1974's "The Man With The Golden Gun", 1987's vastly underrated Timothy Dalton debut "The Living Daylights" and Pierce Brosnan's mediocre but fun "The World Is Not Enough".I'm not going to give plot details of all the movies, but I will say that the picture and sound quality do indeed do live up to expectations. The collectible booklets that come with the dvds are excellent, and while I have not watched any of them yet, I'm sure the extras are excellent. Overall, this is definitely a must have.
