I needed a replacement keyboard and was considering a cheap ordinary wired model when I stumbled on the Logitech Keyboard/Mouse combo.  At the time it was still $$$ for the set, but I still think the price was worth it.  The optical mouse works perfectly on any surface.  The range from the receiver pod is supposed to be a few inches, but I can sit comfortably back in my chair and use both the keyboard and mouse (on my leg) from over three feet away!  I'm still on my first set of batteries in the KB and second in the mouse after 6 months of use.  I love the ease of installation and configuration.  Anyone can configure this keyboard's shortcut buttons to the point that they should never have to get out of a reclined position in the office chair!  Overall, I have to say that I have not had ANYTHING to complain about from Logitech, and this is just one more good product from them!  On a suggestion, it would be nice to be able to turn off the LED on the mouse when you're finished, to save battery life.  But it does dim, which helps.
