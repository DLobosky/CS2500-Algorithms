Maurice is a great character, exactly what a talking cat would be like.  The story is an interesting spin on the story of the piper who plays the rats out of town that is set in Discworld.  The story has the wit and humor that all of Terry Pratchett's books have.  A really enjoyable read for kid and adult fans of Terry Pratchett.  It also has a good moral about working together to solve problems, but really you could ignore that if you wanted . . .
