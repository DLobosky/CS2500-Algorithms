In the Gothic Tom Baker era of Doctor Who which saw stories influenced by classic horror and sci-fi, The Brain Of Morbius takes on Frankenstein, Igor, and the monster.On landing on the forbidding world of Karn, the Doctor's in a right sulk, angry at the Time Lords.  "Meddlesome interfering idiots, messing about with my TARDIS, dragging us a 1000 parsecs off course."  His sulk doesn't last long after seeing a spaceship graveyard, a castle, and a headless body.He also meets Professor Mehendri Solon, a foremost Earth neurosurgeon, and his hulking barbarian servant Condo, who has a long thick eyebrow and a hook for his left hand that Solon once calls a "chicken-brained biological disaster."  Condo is counting on Solon to reattach his real left hand, which had to be removed to save his life.  Solon though, is endeavouring to find a head suitable to house the brain of Morbius, something that'll be his greatest and last operation.  This is puzzling, as Morbius was a renegade Time Lord who with his followers fought the Time Lords and was defeated and executed by vaporization on Karn.  However, what is the weird headless creature with one giant claw in Solon's laboratory?The Sisterhood, a society of virtually immortal women who guard the Sacred Flame and the Elixir of Life, become alarmed when they realize the Doctor is a Time Lord.  They are protective of the Elixir and the Sacred Flame, which has been gradually dying.  No flame means no elixir and pretty soon, no Sisterhood.  Fearing that the Doctor has been by the Time Lords to steal the last of their Elixir, they kidnap him and sentence him to death.  However, aging leader Maren, and her young subordinate Ohica, are thrown when he returns of his own free will (for help) and realize he's not out for their Elixir.Throughout her travels, Sarah has been kidnapped, cryogenically frozen, hypnotized, and more.  Here, she gets blinded (temporarily).  As for the Morbius Monster, it is described as "made from butcher's leftovers," "potpourri," "Mr. Allsorts," and as "Chop Suey, the Galactic Emperor."  It has to be seen to believed.  Hmm, Dr. Who vs. Chop Suey--sounds like a bad sci-fi/kung-fu story.  Never mind.The scene where a brain drops on the floor offended some medical students, but it made for unintentional laughs.  However, scenes of strangulation and someone being gassed by cyanide probably didn't go well with Mary Whitehouse, the UK's Tipper Gore on television.Philip Madoc (Solon) turns in his best performance in a Who story, a performance that's very crucial to the story.  He runs the gamut of emotions, enthusiastically welcoming, cool and rational, angry, desperate, exasperated, and distressed, especially in the brain-dropping scene.  Cynthia Grenville (Maren) and Gilly Brown (Ohica) also do well in their roles.But who is Robin Bland, the writer?  Former script-editor Terrance Dicks turned in his story the day he went on holiday (big mistake, because the producer and current script editor Robert Holmes were unable to contact him) and when he got back, he was incensed, as the story had been changed so much that it was more Holmes' work.  Dicks asked his name to be removed and have some "bland pseudonym" put in its place.  When he saw the aired story, credited to Robin Bland, he'd calmed down since then and was disarmed by the joke.The initial video release was an edited 60 minute programme, and it wasn't until 1996 that it was released in its entirety.  This is one of the more popular stories, as the BBC saw fit to include this among the original video releases in the 1980's.  Along with the story and strong characters, the studio sets work well, particularly Solon's castle.
