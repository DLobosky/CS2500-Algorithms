For $190 NO THANKS.  These SONY's are great as is and using the bass boost on my ipod touch they sound great for my style of music which is wide ranging actually.  I don't need over thumping bass for my own taste.  Depends on the style of music but these for the price are exceptional and they fit and stay in my ears without pushing and twisting them to stay there.  The only negative is the shorter then normal cord. Try a few types and return what you don't like everyone's hearing seems to eb very different.
