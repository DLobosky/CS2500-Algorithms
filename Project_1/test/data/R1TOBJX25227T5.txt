My mom decided to FIOS this movie.  I had heard good things about it.  I think I heard it was a buy or at least rent on DVDUESDAY.  Well, I would have to disagree.  The movie is about these people in a town, set back in the days when cowboys and Indians were around, who find aliens have come to get something from them.  That is the story.  Then, you have a guy who was with a woman, though you never see them together, who wakes up and does not remember anything.  But, he has this weird thing around his wrist.  Turns out aliens may have taken him and the lady and some how he got away.  He is also wanted for killing the lady.  Though he may not have done that.  Get it?  That is the story.Now for the bad part, or "the movie" itself.  Wow, so many things were wrong with this in my opinion.  Let me take it one step at a time.First the actors.  There were a bunch of great actors in the movie.  Some you would see the entire time, others here and there.  But, for some reason, it felt like I was watching a trailer the entire time.  Almost like a movie they made to show at the Oscars.  It was very odd.Next, the effects and backgrounds.  AWFUL,  everything that you see in the movie, you can tell that it is fake and not very well done.  The mountains may have been actually mountains, but they were the worst mountains that I've ever seen.  The times when you saw the aliens or the technology they used also seemed cheaply done.  It was like I was watching a damn commercial or something from 10 years ago.  Watch the movie and reply with what you think.Next would be the story.  Ok, so aliens that are smart enough to fly around the never ending space and then find something on our planet they need and or want.  Are you telling me they would not just come, take what it was and leave without us even knowing?  For some reason they are pissed off and decide to kill the people.  But that is just a story choice I suppose.  For some reason, I could never get into this movie.  I love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.  Like it was being shoved down my throat.  After 15 minutes, I had already forgotten what had happened before.  It was like I was watching something trying so hard to be funny, action packed, thrilling and mysterious, that never really got there.  Oh, and it you have eyes, you may want to skip this movie.  Why you ask?  For at least 2/5 of the movie.  My family and I could not see a damn thing.  The lighting if some of the worst I've ever seen, or haven't seen for that matter.  We were all like "what the hell is going on?"  At one part one of the characters asks if the man can see his target.  I busted out laughing.  The end is boring and you will probably be upset you wasted your time watching.  For so many good actors and a good director, this movie sucked.  If this is what aliens bring, then let us send E.T back home!!!!As I said, we rented this from FIOS.  So, I can not review the special features or the packaging.
