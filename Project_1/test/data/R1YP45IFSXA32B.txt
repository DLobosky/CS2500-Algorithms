I had looked at several stores which had the tv but the picture quality was so so.  The sales people said it was due to all the tv's running off one box.  I came across this TV on Amazon with the Pinnacle stand included but offered from TigerDirect.  I crossed my fingers and took a chance with everthing showing up within a week of ordering.  I had the stand together in about 15-20 mintues.  The tv looks like it would be heavy but its not and was easily placed on the stand.  The picture is set to brilliant and was simply amazing and HD channels.  I put in a blue ray and was just blown away by the clarity and detail and colors and darks.  Mits has done an outstanding job of providing large screen HDTV for bargain prices compared to LCD, Plasma, LED which easily are 2-3 times more.  If your looking for big screen for movies, games, just everyday viewing this is it...I would recommend a UPS battery backup just in case of power outtage with the TV due to an internal fan that cools the bulb.  The only negative i can see is having to replace the bulb. However, a buddy of mine that turned me on to this tv has had his for over 2 years and still on same bulb.  Just get it and get your socks blown off when you watch it...its that good of a picture..........UPDATE 2/2...going on 6 weeks now and it seems the picture is actually Sharper due to bulb breaking in...no issues at all.  One thing I did do is buy a battery backup in case of power outage as this can save you a bulb.  If the power goes out the battery backup kicks in and will continue to power the Tv and most importantly the cooling fan in the TV so it does not over heat and burn out...well worth the cost as I already had a power outage and the backup worked as designed.  I see one person gave the TV ONE star due to it being damaged upon delivery.  This should be disregarded as the TV is INCREADIBLE and the stand is excellent. I Tiger actually credited me back $100 on my purchase as the TV/Stand Combo dropped $100 since my purchase and within their price match period.  This TV will knock your socks off and xbox and playstation games come alive on the screen......
