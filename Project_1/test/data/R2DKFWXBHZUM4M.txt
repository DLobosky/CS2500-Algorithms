It is concerned exclusively with failure of the U.S. Air Defense System which had been carefully designed to defend against such an attack.The air defense system designed for Hawaii was an integrated and modern (at the time). It incorporated such newfangled sub-systems as air warning radars (five sites) and a centralized control center serving as filter and ground control intercept (GCI) center staffed by both army and navy personal with direct communications to the radar sites, army air pursuit (fighter) squadrons, army anti-aircraft regiments, and the U.S. Navy warships anchored in Pearl Harbor (fire direction for their ship borne anti-aircraft guns. In addition there was an air reconnaissance sub-system that would utilize both army and navy long range patrol planes to reconnoiter probable Japanese attack routes. All in all a very effective system that would have probably done a good job of defending Oahu.In the months prior to December 1941 all the hardware for the system was in place and the control center was up and running. Unfortunately, like intelligence systems, this air defense system was only as good as the command structures it served. Neither the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Kimmel nor the commander of the Army's Hawaiian Department demonstrated any interest in the establishment or operating procedures of the system. Since they did not understand it they made little effort in the months before Pearl Harbor to ensure that their senior subordinates cooperated with and supported the system. Not only did the navy opt out of an active role supporting the system, but so did the army. Neither service was wiling to supply either the long range reconnaissance patrols essential to the system nor the personnel needed to adequately man the control center. In the absence of any senior direction intra- and inter- service rivalries and parochial interests hamstrung the air defense system. As is often the case with system failures of any type there is plenty of blame to go around. The authors of this book are especially hard on Admiral Kimmel, General Short and their senior commanders and staffs. It is certainly true that the senior army and navy commands displayed a remarkable lack of interest in or curiosity about what was after all the first line of defense for Hawaii. It is also true both commands appeared to lack strategic sense in their blindness to the possibility that the Japanese might attack the American fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor. On the other hand, the normally brilliant Chief of Staff, General Marshall, does not appear to have made any effort to correct their strategic misperceptions. Further, the brilliant young officers who were really responsible for creating the air defense system appear to have made no effort to explain and `sell' the system to the senior commands.
