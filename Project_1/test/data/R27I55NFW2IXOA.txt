I purchased the Cuisipro Silicone Whisk because it is recommended by Cook's Illustrated. I made a maple syrup glaze yesterday using the Cuisipro  Silicone Whisk. I had to switch to my Le Creuset silicone whisk in the middle of making the glaze because the Cuisipro is just not strong enough to be effective for glazes. It did fine when I beat eggs but could not handle whisking powdered sugar into maple syrup.. I'm sure I will get a lot of use out of it when it comes to lighter ingredients which need to be whisked in my bowls or pots. I think it is flimsy and does not have enough tines to be effective. Also, the tines are not strong enough and tend to bend when they hit the side of a bowl. That has never happened with any other whisk I ever owned, including other silicone whisks.
