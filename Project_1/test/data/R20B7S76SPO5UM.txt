I hadn't previously read anything by Anya Bast before I read FURY, so I have no idea if TRANQUILITY is part of an ongoing series or something the author is writing separately to release as just the two interrelated short stories.That being said, I liked the concept of the shifters, of being a Shadow, of the OtherKin in general. I enjoyed Roane, who is the brother of Merrick, the hero from FURY.  When Roane realized that Merrick and Nikki (the werecougar who the elders of Fury had chosen as Queen) already had chemistry, he stepped aside and left town so as not to have to fight his fellow Alpha brother for the rule.Now, Roane has moved to Tranquility, wanting nothing but to have a home with a pack and be left alone.  He doesn't want to be the Alpha of the Tranquility pack, but the fact that he's recognized Scarlet as his mate is causing problems.  Namely, that Scarlet is the sister of Marcus.  And Marcus is the current alpha leader who hates Roane's guts.  But, as always seems to happen, hot sex ensues, followed by the inevitable HEA filled with more hot sex.Just as I said with FURY, I did enjoy the concept of the story, and I probably would have moved that to REALLY liked if not for two things. One, although I recognize the "I-just-met-you-but-want-to-sex-you-up-now" plot device, especially in stories involving shapeshifters who seem to "recognize" their mates upon meeting, just a tad more introduction before the horizontal tango would have been nice. And secondly, Holy Smokes, Batman!, this story badly needed an editor before it went up! I know Ms. Bast has published a bunch of stories through large-name publishers, but due to the lack of editing, I'm guessing this wasn't one of them.So overall, a great concept, just as FURY was, and I'd definitely be interested in reading a full-length novel or novella starring the OtherKin. Yet on the other hand, the horrible execution of this short tale kept me from loving it like I wanted to.
