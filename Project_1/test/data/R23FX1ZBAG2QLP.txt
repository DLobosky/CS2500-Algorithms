Lucid was the first brand available in the US since the 1900.  French in origin and true to vintage recipes.This is a verte absinthe, which means that when you pour it on a glass, you will see it has a nice soft yellow-green color.  The louche (the result of adding water to it) is mostly white, with some green hints.  The main aroma is anise, but the taste is anise with a quite bitter after taste.  I drank it mixing it 1-5 with ice water and one sugar cube.  The sugar did not modify the bitterness, and the taste remained in my mouth for quite some time.I had read many good reviews on the Lucid.  Most people would agree that it was a good starter absinthe, and not too overwhelming for beginners, but I could not get past the bitterness.  Maybe it was just my batch and I had bad luck with it, but I can not say I enjoyed it very much.However, I would rated it 3 and a half stars.  Specially because after trying other brands this is still not one of my favorites.P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.
