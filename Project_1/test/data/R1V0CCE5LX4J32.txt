These returned models were all chosen because of their good reviews on Amazon. They were all returned because of poor sound quality. The quality varied from poor to mediocre.We were about to give up on getting a new cordless phone for our vacation home, when the salesman recommended this Panasonic phone. We gave it the 'hands on test', and another customer in the store said that the sound was far superior to any of the other phones she had tested, and that she loved it. We then went home to read the excellent reviews on Amazon.  Then we ordered it from Amazon because of the lower price, and because at this point my husand vowed never to unpack and repack a cordless phone again.We were not disappointed - this unit beat the others by miles.  We couldn't believe the difference in the sound. No static and it remained clear when we 'test drove' it around the house and yard. The sound is especially important to me as I have trouble hearing on most phones - cell and cordless.It comes with two handsets which is really convenient as our previous cordless phones only had one.  We love the speaker phone and the intercom that work from the base and both of the handsets.  We like and use he mute and hold features. It's amazing the range and the sound that this phone has. The handsets are smallish, but still comfortable for my husband's large hands and my medium hands.CONS:  The only weak point of this phone is the sound quality of the answering machine. Our outgoing message and incoming messages aren't as clear as we would like, but the phone itself makes up for this flaw.This phone won't be used as much as our home phone, so I'm wondering what effect it will have on the headsets if they sit in their charger units for at least a month or longer, without being used - only time will tell.We also bought a Panasonic KX-TGA 60 headset for this phone, $10.49 on Amazon, and it works very well.So far we are very pleased with this phone and we like that it only takes 6 hours to recharge, not up to 20 like some other phones. Because of the sound quality of this phone, we also bought a two line Panasonic cordless for our home (model KX-TCA 6502B).  Panasonic sound beats them all as far as we are concerned.
