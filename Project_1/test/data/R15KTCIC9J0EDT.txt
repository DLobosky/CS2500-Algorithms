Normally I hate seek and find type games, but there's something about this one that just does it for me.  The graphics are adorable and the many different games differ enough to keep it interesting.  Behind each door is a different room with different objects to find, some moving, some layered, some just plain weird.  There's also a gambling room where you can bet your winnings and win or lose more.  The object is to fund the babies; room, doctor, etc.,.  I'll be returning to buy this one on payday!
