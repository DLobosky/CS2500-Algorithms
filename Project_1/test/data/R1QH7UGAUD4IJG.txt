Tolkien decades ago.  Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read.  Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it.  If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy.The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies.  Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long."If you want him, come and claim him!", said by Arwin as she bravely protects the dying Frodo on horseback.  She then draws her sword, ready to do battle even though she is outnumbered and up against the Nazgul.  Now THERE was a moment.  There are more touching moments in the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and many more battle scenes.  If you have not already seen it, what are you waiting for?
