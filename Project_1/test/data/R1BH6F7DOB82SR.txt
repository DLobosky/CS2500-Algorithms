The characters developed very well and the story line was pretty good.      Definitely a low budget affair and some of the writing a bit amateurish, but the cast and crew really seemed to give it a go and won me over.  The whole here is greater than the sum of its parts.If you like Sci-fi along the lines of Firefly, you should enjoy this.  In fact, I found many things here that seemed to have been payed homage in the Firefly series itself.  I won't spoil your fun, but they're pretty clear.  Firefly had much better scripts, but this series has heart.  Money well spent and good enough that I will enjoy watching many times over.
