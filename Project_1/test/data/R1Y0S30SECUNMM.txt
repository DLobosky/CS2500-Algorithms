Boogeymen The Killer Compilation seemed like a very cool idea to me, at first.  I agree with another reviewer who stated that there should have been about 90 or 100 minutes of horror scenes.  This movie (if that's what you call it) is only 58 minutes, less than one hour!!  Some clips were great (A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and some were the worst movies of all time (The Guardian, Lepracaun).  But I can not say I did not enjoy watching this the first time.  It was cool seeing certain scenes from movies, and some I'd never even seen before! I quickley rented The Dentist after watching a clip from it on this.  Wow, was The Dentist scary!  Really, very freaky stuff.  Other movies I just wanted to skip (The Guardian again, Leprecaun again).  I'm really not sure what to say about this  disk.  I did feel quite dissipointed whwn I finished it.  The clip of Jason (from Jason Goes To Hell The Final Friday) was not cool, mainly because Mr. Voorhees didn't slash anyone.  The scene is where he chases that chick who's really an FBI agent.  I felt they should have included a scene from Friday The 13th Part 3:3D instead.  It'd be really cool to show that scene where he first gets his hockey mask, and shoots that girl, Vera, in the eye with a speargun.  That's my favorite scene from the whole series.  I was dissipointed with the Halloween clip as well.  It was NOT widescreen.  Halloween is a movie that MUST be viewed in widescreen to get the full effect.  But this is ugly old Cropped format.  I enjoyed the clip for Nightmare On Elm Street (where the clip was in widescreen).  I also liked the clip for Phantasm.  But, I felt that they could have removed I Know What You Did Last Summer for something like Evil Dead, maybe.  I expected more like, MANY scenes from these movies, or from the whole series of movies.  As for extras, dissipointment.  Robert Englund's commentary was cool, but I was super duper hoping for a trailer for Jason Goes To Hell.  Not here!  And, no Nightmare On Elm Street trailer, Scream trailer, or a few others.  Most of the trailers are for the bad movies.  The &quot;Name That Frame&quot; game is OK, except it doesn't work on my TV.  The &quot;Flixfacts Animated Trivia&quot; is not to interesting, basically just stuff we all know (like Brad Dourif is the voice of Chucky).  For DVD Rom you get a pretty easy trivia game, and some sound files, or something.  But, that's basically it.  So, all in all, I do not recommend that you buy this disk.  Rent it.  It only takes a few hours (not THREE, as the cover says) to get through everything, and then you'll say &quot;Why'd I buy that?&quot; If you found my review helpful, please be sure and give me a vote.  Thank you very much.
