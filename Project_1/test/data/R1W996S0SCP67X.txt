What is most intriguing about this book is the way it struggles to face, with unabashed honesty, a series of heart-rending life and death questions many of us have been wondering aloud about these many months since the tragedy of 911. The current administration often seems to be more energetically engaged in an effort to manage our perceptions while prosecuting a puzzlingly pointless adventure in Iraq than in actually confronting the deadly foes that really do face us. Herein the author, an anonymous CIA analyst, carefully defrocks the pontificating puerile punditry that passes for conventional political wisdom these days by asking some seemingly basic questions which must either elude or embarrass the apparently dazed and befuddled governing elite, for they consistently refuse to acknowledge or address them. In essence, the author puzzles over why the powers that be seem either unable or unwilling to face the threats we actually must confront as opposed to the more convenient traditional bogeymen they choose to combat. For example, the disastrous misadventure in Iraq is so blatantly counter-productive relating to our efforts to the war on terror one has to wonder whose side Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are actually on, those fomenting terrorism or those combating it. Nothing has done more to emphasize the maniacal accusations of the bin Laden camp than our actions against both Afghanistan and Iraq. Meanwhile, we ignore the much more pressing threats both here at home and on the larger world stage in terms of the terrorist groups acting to endanger us. The real tragedy, of course, is that in all this time, the ghastly though carefully-managed facts relating to the real cost, in both blood and treasure are being justified to bolster the political fortunes of the current administration. Thus we continue to squander our finest young men and women in this vainglorious albeit quixotic adventure abroad, even as we face growing danger from another 911-style terrorist assault at home. If the truth be told, according to the author, we are demonstrably much less safe now than we were in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.The author's theme is that the single greatest continuing threat for Americans is the mistaken notion that the Islamist terrorists are targeting us because of our beliefs and our values rather than for the actions our government and corporations have taken against the Muslims across the Middle East. Of course, our political superstructure finds it advantageous to promote this set of misperceptions; again and again in a series of speeches over the last three years, for example, Mr. Bush emphasizes that the terrorists hate us because we are free and prosperous, never acknowledging that perhaps they  hate us for much more tangible and controversial reasons, such as our biased and knee-jerk tendency to support Israel regardless of the circumstances, or our promotion and protection of corrupt and authoritarian Muslim regimes such as Saudi Arabia or Iran under the late Shah. Nor do our leaders seem to consider our invasions of Afghanistan or Iraq as potential provocations to the Muslim world.  Our leaders never acknowledge such possibilities because they do not want us to question their actions (or inactions) regarding the terrorist threats.       The most provocative and damning of the points made in the book is the way the author illustrates how cleverly and ingenuously Mr. bin Laden has threaded together a powerful invective that uses our actions and our words to prove that, in his perception, we represent a grave and present danger to the world's Muslim community. And as the author warns us, unless we begin to recognize the true nature of the terrorist threats and stop flailing about for short term geo-political gain through misadventures that waste our precious strengths and sap our treasure, we are likely to continue losing the war against terrorism. This is a valuable and worthwhile book, and one I recommend for any serious student of current affairs.
