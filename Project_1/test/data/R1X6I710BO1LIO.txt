Beware, there is very little in common between the two series.  The Number One Ladies Detective Series is very accesable to the general reading public.The three novels of the Portuguese Irregular Verbs series are less accessable.  The main reason is that McCall Smith's humor is very dry. The delivery is so subtle as to border on the sublime.  This sort of absurdist humor about academic life is not for everyone.  If you like your humor direct and to the point, this is not the series for you.  If you like your humor really dry, this series is a delight.  However, if you are not sure, start the series with "The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs", the best of the three novels.
