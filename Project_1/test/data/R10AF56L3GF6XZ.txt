According to the book and based on studies over a twenty-five year period, more than two-thirds of professionally-managed stock funds were outperformed by an unmanaged S&amp;P500 index fund.There, I summarized the whole book.  I believe the author is credible because he holds the same view as Warren Buffet.  Malkiel does not fully believe in an efficient market or as he calls it, the random-walk theory (so much for the title).  He believes in somewhere in between just as Buffet.    That is, the market does not always behave rationally or efficiently and it is precisely these times an intelligent investor can reap big rewards.  He can't fully believe in the Random-Walk Theory.  The studies mentioned above made it clear that one-third of the portfolio managers do beat the market.  And then there is the legendary Warren Buffet who has consistently beat the market.  The only difference between Malkiel and Buffet is attitude.  Where as Buffet believes he can find those inefficiencies in the market and profit from them, Malkiel believes it is very rare and not worth the effort.  So the former sees the bottle half-full and the latter sees it half-empty.  How you invest depends on what type of person you are.Let's look at the choices.  Remember, two-thirds of the stock funds cannot beat the index, so that means one-third of them are outperfoming the market.  So you can look for these guys and they do exist (Magellan, Templeton, although the original portfolio managers are long gone).  Or you can believe you are as smart as Warren Buffet!  And pick your own winning stocks...good luck...but if you can, this is a better way to invest than with mutual funds since there are no annual fees.  Or just forget it, and as the author suggests, buy that index fund.  I like it, simple and in the middle between the three choices since the fees for the index fund are very low.  But this is what the stock market is about without reading over 400 pages!
