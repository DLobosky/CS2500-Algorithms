If you are expecting this book to be a Biblically based book for Christian teens, move on.  The author is new age and the god he is having conversations with is not the God of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  If you are into new age and/or are looking for a belief system that lets you do basically anything you want, you've found your "bible."  I found a lot of his "conversations" to be silly and not very well thought out.  Some are dangerous in that they could be construed as encouraging dangerous lifestyle habits.  That isn't necessarily what the author intended, but when did teens ever listen to what adults are REALLY saying?  This book is emphatically NOT for Christians or believers in the Bible and probably not really good for anyone.  It seems to encourage a "me first and only" lifestyle and will most likely only confuse teens, at best.  At worst, it could do a lot of harm.  I gave it one star only because that's as low as the scale goes.
