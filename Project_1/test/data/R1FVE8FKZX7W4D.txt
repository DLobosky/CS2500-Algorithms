I bought the "non-dimmable" version of this bulb (sold alongside the dimmable one, you select from popup menu at top of product page) for twenty bucks on Oct. 29 2011 (prices/availability can change over time.) I also bought 3 other LED bulbs from other vendors on Amazon the same week. I have been confused trying sort out the various features, color temp, and price/value of these LED bulbs which are an emerging technology, so I ordered 4 different, intending to order more of the "winning bulb" for my office fixtures. If these LED's truly last 30,000 hours or more, I'll be stuck with them for a while!To save you time reading more below, in a nutshell, I rate THIS bulb #3 for price/features/value of the 4 I purchased (mostly because the one I received emits light in a pattern of an odd-shaped spotlight rather than floodlight, read more below). At this writing, apparently the same vendor "ledCREElight fulfilled by Amazon" sells a 6W bulb I liked best (of 4 I looked at) overall. Link here, currently priced at 14 bucks (but only 10 bucks 2 days ago when I ordered):  High Power 6W LED MR16 GU10 base Flood 45° Soft White LampBack to THIS listing's bulb, advertised as the Lightkiwi 6w Cree GU10 Base 45 Flood Warm White 3000K, had the following characteristics when I tried it in my office track lighting: When turned on and you look directly at it, this bulb is much brighter than 4W bulbs. This bulb gets hot enough that it is uncomfortable to touch for more than a few seconds, but NOT anywhere near as hot as regular halogen bulb that can burn skin on contact. The 4W bulbs I tested only get warm to the touch (but they are  dimmer). The "color" of the light seems fairly neutral/white to me but some might call it a touch "blue". On a white wall it does not seem "warm" to me despite the description, and is about the same color as the first bulb listed below. But again, I'm not unhappy with the color. My chief complaint (which you may like, depending on your application) would be that it casts 3 circles of light (one from each LED) which mostly overlap each other but do not form a circle of light, rather a "3-leaf clover" of light with fairly hard edges. More of a spotlight, with that shape, than a "soft" floodlight. The other bulbs I tried (see my other reviews) all have a very soft, diffused illumination pattern. They really have no edge at all (which I preferred).This bulb has a base which is about 1 1/4 inches long (measured from the tip of rear contacts to where the bulb widens out a lot). Some reviews have complained that this makes any bulb of this style (from several vendors) stick out of the fixture too much. Doesn't matter in my case, and the 1 inch (shorter) base style will not fit in my fixture (I had to return one bulb I could not test as it was too short for my fixture even though advertised as MR16 GU10). Compare the various product photos carefully and you can tell which bulbs are a bit longer/shorter in the base, if it matters to you either way. It's kind of stupid that the mfr.'s are not more consistent for a bulb with the same apparent designator "code" MR16 GU10.At about 20 bucks when I purchased, this bulb is nearly the most expensive of any I tried (except for one that wouldn't fit my fixture) and performs less well than cheaper bulbs in my opinion.
