In the beginning Adam Carlyle's character was strong and the writing solid, but within a few pages Callie enters and the writing begins to waver and lose its strength and focus. The story becomes predictable (and mild) and I wasn't sure exactly where Callie gets her talent to speak with animals, moreless singing to them.   I think the writer is somewhat young, and her writing reflects a certain sweetness,which I do respect.  That said, if you want something more intense and gripping, I would highly suggest Kresley Cole's Triology - If You Dare - If You Desire - If You Deceive -.  She's hard to beat.
