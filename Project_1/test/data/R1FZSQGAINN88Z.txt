The interface is great looking, when it works, and the streaming ability while playing high quality movies is very impressive.CONS:Apple intentionally limits this hardware with small disk space.  I don't know how anyone can possibly fit their media collection (movies and music) on a 40gb disk, or a 160gb disk for that matter.  All they had to do was enable the usb port for external storage, and everyone would be suited.  But of course, they can't force their users to upgrade if they did that.  Enough said, I will be hacking my apple TV to host a larger disk.The menus lag.  Huge delays when taking the device out of what appears to be a sleep mode when not used for a period of time.  When I turn on my TV, the menus don't appear for at least a minute.  After about 10-15 seconds of lag, they mostly catch up.  Overall, the menus lag when skipping around, and its embarassing to show guests when they ask how much was paid.Everything is over simplified.  There aren't enough options in the unit, and the remote is too small.  Its nice having a small remote, but this might be too small, and I'm not a mac fan boy, so I don't own a touch or iphone.  The remote has no options, and enabling options during music or video playback is a huge pain.  All they had to do was add on-screen menus and a slightly larger remote with a few more options.  It looks good, but at the sacrifice of usability.   Same can be said for the unit, there is no power or reset switch - and I've had to reset mine by pulling the power at least half a dozen times.  Apple, this isn't the year 2050, take it easy and stay with what your hardware can do.Conclusions:If you really need a good video solution to stream mpeg4 video from itunes, this is a good solution, but be prepared for the lag.  I'd suggest saving your money and wait for a good revision on the software side for the LAG factor, and a hardware revision for the disk factor.  Be aware that apple is still using parallel IDE drives in these units, hugely impairing the ability to upgrade.  Probably intentional.  Wait for SATA drives and a more reliable OS that has the proper hardware to support it.  Ideally, wait until they start supporting external USB, but that will never happen, which is why apple will never own the market.UPDATE:  After having the ATV for over 90 days, my review stands.  A few nights ago, the crapple TV crapped out three times inexplicably while watching a video... each time required a reset, which takes some time.  Now, each time I start a streaming video, the unit stops responding for a few minutes, followed by the need to restart the video a second time.  The unit doesn't stream well, and if it doesn't stream well, it is useless to me.  You can't store a significant amount of video or music on a 40GB disk.UPDATE #2:  After months, the delays when searching streaming audio/video in not tolerable.  There must be something wrong with my unit, it is not possible that any manufacturer would consider this market ready.  The funny thing is, the delays have gotten worse over the past months with each update.  ITunes 9.0.2 is now disconnecting from the Apple TV now, about every other day.  I have to reboot the Apple TV or restart iTunes to get the connection back.  I'm going to try to send this unit back, this can't be right.
