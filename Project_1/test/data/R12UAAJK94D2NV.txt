The dialogue is interesting and the main villain (the Nazi general) is hilarious and great to watch. I especially loved Hitler's character, however...Tarantino knew to keep him under wraps, only allowing him enough screen time to reveal this man's insanity and fear.The closing scene in this movie truly showcases Tarantino's talent. It's simultaneously tragic and triumphant, and goes from a low to a brilliant high in seconds. He also managed to nudge in a few of his own political beliefs, particularly when the Nazi general labels the Inglorious Bastards "terrorists" in their fight for vengeance against the Nazi regime. I'll leave the reader to their own beliefs. In all, it was a great, great film that I certainly would not mind watching again. I will buy the DVD.
