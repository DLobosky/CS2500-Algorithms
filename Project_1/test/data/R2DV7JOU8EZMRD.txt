I am very pleased with these wireless headphones.  I use them for watching TV while not disturbing others in my house, and also for listening to FM stereo music while working out in my basement. The sound quality is excellent as is the range.  My TV & FM receiver are in my living room, sound is very clear where my exercise equipment is located in the basement.  I'm 70 years old though, and have lost much of my hearing over 4000 Hz. So it might be that a wired headphone would give better fidelity as some of these reviews have said.  For me though, I doubt if I could tell the difference.  The sound quality of these is excellent. Also, the convenience of not being tied to a cord is great!
