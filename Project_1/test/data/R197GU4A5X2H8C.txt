Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men is gripping, compelling and well-acted courtroom drama.  Tom Cruise is at his likable, charming best as Lt. Daniel Caffey.  Caffey is a Navy lawyer whose specialty is breezing through cases,  in fact he's never tried a case in front of a jury.  He gets assigned a case about two Marines on a Cuban base who are accused of killing another Marine.  It appears to be an open and shut case, the Marines are guilty.  Caffey is ready to cop a plea bargain, but another Navy lawyer, Lt. Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) thinks her clients were just following orders.  What unfolds is a fast paced, twisting, turning plot that climaxes with one of the best courtroom confrontations in movie history.  The exchange is between Mr. Cruise and Jack Nicholson who plays Col. Jessup the commander of the Cuban base.  Mr. Nicholson only appears on the screen for a brief period of time, but he gives one of his most fiery, intense performances ever.  The movie also features some excellent supporting work from Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Pollack and J.T. Walsh.
