This has got to be the best TV made to date.  I've never owned or even seen a better performing TV.  The picture is vibrant, crisp, and realistic.  The design of the TV itself is very sleek, from the 0.2" frame to the lit-up Samsung emblem on the front of the TV, to the silver base. Even the remote is cool-looking.  One side of the remote is a full qwerty keyboard, while the other side is more of a conventional remote.  Not to mention that you can watch 3D TV without the need of a 3D converter, which was needed in older 3D TV's.This connects to internet/wifi, offering several apps such as facebook and Pandora through Samsung's Smart Hub.  Several 3D videos are also available through the Smart Hub for free.I still haven't gotten the chance to watch full 1080p HD, but even the 1080i looks better than full HD that I've seen on other TVs.
