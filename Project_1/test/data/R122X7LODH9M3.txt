It says so on the back of the box that's sold without the buzzers. Since this was released after the Buzz Mega Quiz game, you can use the buzzers from that game to play this. So if you have the buzzers from the Mega Quiz game you DON'T need to buy this Hollywood game with buzzers, unless you plan on playing with more than four people. If you don't have the Mega Quiz game, buy this game WITH the buzzers. I hope that's not too confusing.Now for the Hollywood Game. If you like the Buzz Mega Quiz and are a movie fan, you'll like this - a lot! Buzz is back with his clever and smarmy remarks. The emphasis is on movies, but the questions are multiple choice, and often you can eliminate one or two choices. Several rounds can be played, including Hollywood Stars, Top Rank, Fact or Fiction, Rollover and the Final Countdown round where you time is shortened if your opponents answer correctly ahead of you. This game is also Eye Toy compatible, though that's not necessary to play. You can customize the game for what rounds you want to play. There's a wide variety of characters and sound effects to choose from. The red button will make your character say a witty remark after the answers are given in any round. One person can play, but you're limited to two rounds, Time Builder and Hotseat. Like the Buzz Mega Quiz, you can choose Team Play, Quickfire Quiz or Quizmaster modes. The latter requires an Dualshock 2 analog controller. The buzzers plug into the USB connectors on your PS2, right of where you plug in your controllers. The game is definitely more fun when multiple people are playing. There's a TV version of Buzz out for the PS3. I hope they eventually make it for the PS2 as well. If you're into movie trivia, get this game!
