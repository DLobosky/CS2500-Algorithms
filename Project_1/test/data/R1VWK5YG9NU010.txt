

The Butterfly Effect: How Your Life Matters by Andy Andrews is an inspirational book about how every life and every person makes a difference in generations to come.  The book  is a small hardback that is perfect for laying out on the coffee table or end table as a discussion piece. The story only takes about ten or fifteen minutes to read and each page is filled with inspiring art work.The story line of the book is similarly inspiring as the author sets out to prove that our lives and our actions make a difference.  The story is a great motivational story and I could see it given as a graduation speech or a  plea for someone who thinks their life doesn't matter.  Over all I think it will make a great gift book or conversation piece in someone's living room.If you are looking for a great gift book for a graduating senior or someone else taking huge life steps, this book is for you.  I also highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great, easy to read conversational book about how our live influence others.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson as part of the BookSneeze  program.
