I ordered this mister for my mother the same day I ordered the stainless steel Norpro for myself. They both had similar reviews, so I got this white one to match her kitchen, and the stainless Norpro for mine.  I was more than a little jealous when hers turned out better than mine.  They're both clear so you can see to fill it, but this one is smooth, heavy glass; the Norpro is acrylic that takes on a cloudy look after some use. The Prepara gives a nice,  even mist--the closest I've found to the unhealthy aerosol cans.  Like with any non-aerosol mister, you're going to get a few larger droplets or "squirts" at times, particularly towards the end of the spray when the pressure is running out.  Most of the small gripes I've read about with all air-powered misters just come with the territory of going aerosol-free.  If you're making a change, you have to expect things to be different.  People seem to get really disappointed or even irate when air misters don't spray the same as aerosol cans, or natural sugar substitutes don't taste like regular sugar--or artificial sugar.  But you can't make a change and then blame the product when it's just not the same.  The only thing that will spray just like an aerosol can is an aerosol can. This mister does, however, come close. So far it has performed nicely and consistently, and in my opinion gives the best spray you can get without chemical propellants.  I've noticed that releasing the leftover pressure after each use seems to help give more consistent results.  The spray is not as fine or as even when mom forgets to "let the air out" in between uses. It looks like it holds very little oil, but that small amount lasts a surprisingly long time because you use so much less when you spray instead of pour in oil to coat the pan.  It's also nice for spraying onto salads and for putting just enough oil on pasta to keep it from sticking.  The more pumps you give it, the finer the mist; a fine spray to coat meat takes 7-8 pumps; a coarser spray for salads or coating pans only needs 5-6. I've also read horror stories about "exploding" misters.  This won't happen if you take your cues from the sprayer.  You can feel the pressure build with each pump; when you start feeling decent resistance, stop pumping; it's pressurized and ready to spray.  Any mister that you overpump will blow its top--all that pressure has to go somewhere; if you don't force too much pressure in, the mister won't force it back out. Every time I use this mister at my mom's, I consider swiping it back and switching it for mine, but I don't have the heart.  I'll just wait till my Norpro wears out and then replace it with this model.  To me, the lack of chemicals and the ability to choose my own type and quality of oil more than makes up for any nominal difference people find in the performance of this mister over spray cans.
