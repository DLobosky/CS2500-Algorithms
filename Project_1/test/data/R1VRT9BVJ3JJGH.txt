Indispensable: A Critical Review.I bought this book several months ago as a part of a three-book purchase in order to get a grip and master the Adobe CS3 premium suite.  This book is phenomenal.  There are many reasons why one should own this book.  First, it is a great compliment to The CS3 For Dummies, as Dummies is essentially a reference book that explains the use of the tools and what CS3 is capable of.  Dummies, unlike this book, WOW and another that I'm recommending, How to Cheat in Adobe Flash CS3 , Dummies does not give you real-world examples, nor in color, nor does it provide you with a CD rom of extras which this Wow! book (and, Cheat in Flash) does.To say that this entire production suite  enables one to create artwork,  create animation,repair photos, design brochures, create and publish websites is saying alot, All of this is possible (and more with this Design Suite.), but there is a steep learning curve with all of the applications, if you're fully interested in doing really amazing work.  This is why all three books are essential.WOW, Illustrator, is essentially a reference book filled with essays by artist whom have produced work with the Creative Suite and want to share the process of some of their work.  This book is fairly detailed and aside from the CD rom, each of the chapters has the essay plus-- along the margins--color step by step, before and after pictures of each step.  So, if there are 7 steps to a project, the margins will have a total of 14 pictures that accompanies the written text.  And, going through a few of the exercises, it really helps to reinforce the material.The main author, Sharon Steuer, suggests that after one graduates from this book to purchase Real World Adobe Illustrator CS3.  It may or  may not be necessary, but certainly, if you want to enhance your ability to work in vector-based objects, transfer jpg, photos or "rasterized" images to vector, create logos or as a part of a project to transfer to Flash, InDesign or Dreamweaver, this book will be of great service to you.  Again, I strongly suggest picking up a copy of CS3 for Dummies, first then adding this book, WOW!, to have a strong command of Illustrator (and Cheat in Flash) for the Flash software.  If you're like me, and a lot of ideas are circulating in your head and you've wondered how expensive it would be to pay someone to do it, then these books will be a lifesaver.Strongly recommended.
