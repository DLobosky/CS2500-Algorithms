The Old Man and the Sea is Ernest Hemingway at his simplest, and most powerful, as a story teller.  The sentences are short.  The meaning is clear.  The cadence of the prose advances your sense of what is happening.An old man goes out fishing alone from Cuba and hooks the fish of a lifetime.  This fish could make a lifetime of disappointments and setbacks all worth while.  After an incredible and exhausting fight, the fish is his.  Now all he has to do is get it back to shore.  Then the struggle really begins!The Old Man and the Sea lets us see our own lives more clearly, by experiencing the challenge to and empathizing with the fisherman in this classic tale of man versus nature and man versus himself that explores the true nature of human nobility.  What does life mean?  What is striving for?  From what do we gain our dignity?Anyone who thinks that he who dies with the most toys wins will can learn a great deal from this story. Even if the story was not so compelling and universal in its appeal and themes, the book is worth the trip just for the writing. Simple words combine into simple sentences that build into metaphors that pile on top of metaphors in order to make for a magnificent vista and experience for you. Seldom has so much complexity been portrayed with such simplicity. What's even more astonishing is how short this novella is. Amazing! Just to let you know how much I love this book, I often use the techniques and concepts in The Old Man and the Sea in my own writing.    Miscommunication is what people have the most trouble with in cooperating with each other. Any time you run into that stall, think about how Hemingway would have solved the problem. Tell a story like this one that makes the point you want to share.  Then tell the story again and again.  Thirty times or more, and everyone will begin to get it.  When your listeners start telling the story thirty times to others, you have made an important first step. Read this book, reread this book, learn from it each time, and enjoy ... enjoy ... enjoy!
