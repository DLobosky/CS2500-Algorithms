I got these for an Unlocked BlackBerry z10, I got these specifically because of the quantity and the fact that they are clear (I hate the matted kind that make weird fuzz on the screen [mostly white screen], I would much rather have clear!These were easy to install, they have videos and instructions, but they are easy to do (I have a lot of touchscreen devices, so I apply many screen protectors).  They went on easy and if possible put a screen protector on the device before ever using it (I always do, and it avoids having any streaks or fingerprints on the screen that are hard to wipe off [for this phone I used the one that was on it in the box until I got these]).  Also, when you start putting it down if you get bubbles that do not want to come out, than most likely lint is on the screen, I find it best to get a small piece of scotch tape and gently lift the protector, grab the lint with the scotch tape and than put it back down (that leaves a perfect screen protector [aka, one that you do not notice].These screen protectors are cheap and do their job, I am glad they give you more than one, since all to frequently are screen protectors coming in one packs (that is too much pressure to get it on right; and they are also expensive). -- These are perfect!  Their price range is right and the quality and clear film is undetectable.  The screen is also slick (not sticky feeling) so it feels natural using the touch interface and does not pull at facial hair.In the end these are great priced screen protectors that are easy to apply and have all the proper cut outs for the BlackBerry z10, they cover the entire glass side of the phone (it is easy to align if you use the light sensor on the front of the device to line the hole.  These are perfectly clear and you will not detect that you have it on.Once you get the screen protector on, you can usually expect 2 or so years of use, before it just will not clean anymore, so take the time and put it on right and you do not have to worry about it!Highly recommend!!!!!!
