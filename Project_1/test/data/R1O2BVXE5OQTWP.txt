All the specifications on the MX 1100 made me believe my search may be over.  Alas, my search continues, but that's not to say this isn't a very good mouse in the interim.TRACKING:The MX1100 has a 1600dpi laser sensor, which is very good, but not quite gaming quality.  I don't play games that much anymore so this wasn't a huge issue.  I can't tell the difference between my Logitech G7 gaming mouse and the MX1100 in WarCraft III or day-to-day functions.COMFORT:It is ergonomically designed for right-handed users and though my hand feels somewhat comfortable on it, it is going to take a little longer for me to get used to because of it's sheer size.  I have small hands so maybe this won't be an issue for those with larger hands.  I find myself adjusting my grip on the MX1100 often and my pinky doesn't sit on the grooves like the way they're meant to.  The longer adjustment period  may be necessary due to the fact I was using the G7 for so long.BUTTONS & SCROLL WHEEL:There are 5 physical buttons, if you don't count the scroll wheel.  The thumb back/forward buttons, the 2 DPI adjustment buttons, and a button to change the scrolling to click or not when you turn the wheel.  The back button seems placed just a tad too high from where my thumb actually rests and a bit small.  It is dead quiet however, which can't be said for the two primary buttons (left/right click).  These are much louder than I'm used to and sound very "cheap."  I have a Microsoft laptop mouse that clicks quietly and feels great.  The scroll wheel is nice and I'm happy to see that their nicer scroll wheel is starting to trickle down to their mice, other than the Revolution.  I like the non-clicky, free spinning wheel, but also the ability to make it click should I change my mind.BATTERY:I haven't used up the included batteries yet but they are supposed to last about 9 months.  If you install the SetPoint software, it actually estimates how many days are remaining before the batteries run out.  The fact that it takes AA batteries instead of having a built-in rechargeable actually was a selling point for me and why I never bought the Revolution.  I am very wary of built-in rechargeables because of the problems they can incur during normal usage.  Plus, my G7 would not last more than a day on a full charge and I was sick of changing batteries daily.  I don't need one more thing in my life to be mindful of charging.  With the MX1100, I can use regular alkalines or my own NiMH batteries and never worry about buying proprietary batteries or sending it in for service to replace it.SUMMARY:Logitech's premium non-rechargeable cordless mouse is definitely their best offering to date that isn't a rechargeable.  I feel they can decrease the size just a tad and make it more universally comfortable.  For the price, I think they can also improve the materials and noisy buttons.
