With her husband's death, Kiki's life is changed--she loses money, she loses friends and she faces losing the custody of her 11 year old daughter, Anya.  But with her job at the scrapbook store, good friends, a lovely Great Dane and a blossoming romance with a police detective, she might be able to make it.  This was a good mystery with good twists and turns and great characters.  I really enjoyed this book and will continue with the series (there are three books, to date).  I borrowed this book from my public library. [...]
