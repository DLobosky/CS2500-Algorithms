Here, in a near-future, alternate Atlanta, Georgia, Kate Daniels, a mercenary for hire, is investigating the death of her guardian by something capable of ripping a human apart with claws and teeth.  Unfortunately, in Kate's world, there are a number of possibilities, from vampires or weres to worrisome possibilities of Something Else, something unknown--as magic and magical creatures have returned to the world.Well done characterizations, writing, plotting and et cetera. In particular, the world building has me happy.  The gritty world in which the heroine, Kate Daniels, lives is extremely well developed and not a cookie cutter reprise of other dark or urban fantasy landscapes. Sure, there are similarities; there's no way a writer can be totally unique in an urban fantasy. But you won't have read anything exactly like this near-future, magic-riddled Atlanta!
