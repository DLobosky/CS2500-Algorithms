This isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it certainly isn't the horribly bad movie that I imagined after reading the reviews on this site. It is a sly take on capital punishment, as you probably know already. It will hold your interest right through to its twisted end, which is what entertainment is about, isn't it? Having said that, I did find the characters a little cliched -- (1) the alcoholic and dissolute but brilliant professor(2) the emotional and crusading activist(3) the plucky and assertive reporter(4) the good-old-boy country lawyer(5) the well-groomed but brainless governorThe movie has its moments, and although the "big explosive ending" was not exactly opaque to me, it does make you think. What "Dead Man Walking" accomplished at an emotional level, "The Life of David Gale" accomplishes in its message and plot. Definitely worth a watch!
