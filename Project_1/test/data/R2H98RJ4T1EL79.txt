The tech specs can be read and analyzed on-line for those who want heavy information.In a nutshell the BDP-SX1000 is an outstanding do everything and portable (also an outstanding base Blu-ray Player for your Home Theater; this will become very obvious by the end of this review!!!)Highlights in a NUTSHELL; 10" diagonal HD screen clarity of a FULL HD 1080P Picture (actually 1024 x 600 lines) but believe me you won't be disappointed!!!.  The screen has 3 OUTSTANDING FEATURES 1.) It rotates 180 degrees and tilts 90 degrees allowing you to watch it at just about any angle.  NOTE: it even folds flat to look like a fat ipad.  NO KIDDING!!!!  2.) All controls are touch keys on the screens bezel (no need for the remote in close or portable use). NOTE: just as many features as the supplied remote.  3.) there are 2 infrared sensors on the unit for up to 20 foot activation using the remote commander control.  (the first is on the bezel for portable use, and the second is on the front of the bottom portion for base home theater control (closed lid using HDMI cable to Home theater HD A/V units.) So you can see how great this unit is already!!!  Now quick bullet items that keep this Sony as the BEST/FUN BD Porable/Base Unit available!!!!!Here goes;  5 hour built-in rechargeable battery (reaches that using headphones and keeping screen illumination at default settings) NOTE: approx 6 hours to fully recharge unit in OFF position).  Connectivety to and from the BDP-SX1000 1 HDMI output to home theater this is full hd 1080p (outstanding) NOTE: you must supply your own HDMI Cable!!!!.  There are A/V mini plug in/output sockets for camcorder or other various inputs.  Note: Sony supplies this cable!!!!.  There is a USB socket for USB devices input.  NOTE: USB Devices (music/photos/movies) vary see specs and flash drives tested up to 8GB.  INTERNET LAN  free access to over 40 services (Broadband) for BD-Live, Sony Bravia Internet video, and Software updates plus more various programs, music etc.  NOTE: see specs for details!!!(plus you must supply router and LAN cable)  Supplied Remote commander control (batteries included)is fully equipped including volume control.  The control range is up to 20 feet.   There are 2 headphone jacks.AC power and DC Car adaptors provided.Comments -  This units has some weakness' they are; internal speakers saturate at 16 good in a quiet close environment ONLY. (thats why the dual headphone jacks. NOTE: you must supply the headphones.) Next the screen is at it's best in average to low light for the maximum watchability. (Brightly areas tend to washout the picture even when adjusting to maximum video settings)  Especially those dark movies dimly lit movies (ie. Harry Potter). The PICTURE IMPROVES TO AMAZING THE DARKER THE AREA!!!!!!  OKAY IN AVERAGE LIGHT.Unit is NOT WIFI ready AND NO TOUCHSCREEN or KEYBOARD (Who cares it does everything else!!!!!!!This unit is so fantastic and loaded.  All features do work quite nicely and Sony provides on-line software updates on a regular basis!!!You can use it on the go, in the car but there's no restaining device.  A pillow/pad is good but watch the ventilation to prevent over heating.I hooked my BDP SX1000 up to my Full HD Home Theater using the HDMI CABLE and it is awesome.  Especially if you have a 120 or 240mhz HDTV wow!!!!This ONLY the tip of the iceberg.  BOTTOMLINE:  SONY inventor of Blu-ray and this is their first Portable Blu-ray.  They took their time because now they can offer big player features and more in this OUTSTANDING PORTABLE!!!!  ENJOY IT!!!!  A MUST HAVE Unit, buy it intergrates with other Sony technology very nicely!!!!  Great value, very sturdy design and streamlined. A beauty!!!I am.   PS - I haven't even talked about all the cd, dvd, bd, mp3 that can be loaded up.  This unit is amazing.   Back to watching AVATAR!!!!!!
