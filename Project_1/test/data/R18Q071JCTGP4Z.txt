Why I got it: Slipped on a patch of ice this winter, seriously sprained an ankle, wrenched my back. Lugging around my usual vacuum, let alone moving AT ALL...was incredibly painful. The dust bunnies were building up, plus the accumulated &quot;stuff&quot; that hits the floor every day. I figured this would be a possible solution, even though the price seemed high. But I had already looked at the posts at the Roomba Users Group (yes, there is one out there) and they seemed to like their Roombas and, more importantly, the thing seemed to last - and work.   The results? Better than I ever expected. I sat down, watched television and let it take over a HUGE room. It crossed the room in some random pattern that made no sense to me but within 20 minutes or so, the floor was actually clean. I could walk across it in my socks and not pick up so much as a loose crumb.    Having said that, this is NOT a substitute for deep cleaning or mopping...and you do have to spend a bit of time &quot;prepping&quot; the room, making sure big stuff is off the floor and moving loose cords out of the way. But I always did this with my regular vacuum, anyway.     My ankle and back are fine now but I still use the Roomba regularly. It saves me time and energy, especially in the rooms we don't use a lot but which need a regular going over. An added bonus? It is fun to take out at parties and impress the &quot;techies&quot; you know....the people who always have the latest gadget.
