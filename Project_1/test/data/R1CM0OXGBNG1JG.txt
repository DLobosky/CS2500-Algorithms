Usually Big Fish gives you a free trial on their adventure games, so you can see if you want to buy it or not.  I really appreciate this because some of their games are fantastic examples of point & click adventures, and others are just hidden object games thinly disguised as point and click adventures.  I debated before buying this, but in the end I did.  Would I have bought it if there had been a free trial?  Probably not, after doing a few of the hidden object scenes.Scene transitions are often slow.  Accessing the journal is slow.  However, the actual adventuring is pretty good, with a few inventive twists.  The graphics are good.  Inventory is labeled and works usually the first time you try.  The puzzles are some that I've seen before, but they aren't bad.  This is why the game has received as many stars from me as it has.So, what's the problem,aside from slow transitions?  This game has the absolutely worst, most annoying hidden object scenes I've ever encountered.  This is because it also has the worst, most annoying mis-tap penalty ever.  The penalty seems to be completely random.  It happens when you are trying to move around your expanded screen.  It happens when you tap an object you think is one you're looking for, but isn't, even if you haven't tapped anything for a while.  It happens when you tap the object you ARE looking for!  Yes, even correct tapping will not prevent the penalty.  I was trying to pick up a hammer to smash another object, and I kept getting the penalty.  Not to mention the hammer wouldn't smash the object until I used a hint, which confirmed my hunch that I was correct.  Well, developers, if your object was to make me angry while playing, mission accomplished!The only saving grace was that there weren't as many hidden object scenes as some games have.  In my opinion, putting hidden object scenes in point and click adventures is a lazy developer's way of trying to make a game longer.  Longer isn't always better.  If there is a skip button for puzzles, there should be a skip button for hidden object scenes.  Then people who like them can play them and the rest of us can get on with the game.  At least let us nix the mis-tap penalty so we can speed through them!I played on a second generation Kindle Fire, in the middle level of difficulty.EDIT:  The further I got, the more hidden object scenes popped up.  I would no longer say there weren't many.  Finally, I got fed up with the game and switched to the easiest level of play.  The mis-tap penalty disappeared at this level, which made it much easier to get through the fussy hidden object screens.  I gave back one star, but slow transitions and long-winded cut scenes don't merit a higher rating than that.
