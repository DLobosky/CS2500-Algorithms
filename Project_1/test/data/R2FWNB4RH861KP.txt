What kind of aggravated me some was that the first and last parts of the movie were not in 3D. The movie tells you they planned the film this way right before the movie starts but still. What were they trying to go for, a Wizard of Oz effect? When you entered the grid part of the movie it was all in 3d, and some of those effects were kind of stunning. A few moments in the movie show just what 3d can really look like and impress you visually, but other parts the 3D does not do much to make you feel inside the movie world, or even know there is any 3d going on at all.  I guess after seeing Tangled (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy) it is hard to compare the two to one another. Tangled starts out visually stunning and runs the whole way through, where Tron has a few continuous moments of visual bliss.
 I am not saying the 3D effects of tron were that bad, but when compared to the other 3 movies I seen on my TV, this one was not as good at bringing me into the story with 3d.
