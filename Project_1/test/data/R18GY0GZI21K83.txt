James Caan and Barbara Streisand are awesome togetherThis is a great movie.  I originally saw it because it was on AFI's 100 greatest romances.  And it is a great romance, because the movie's character's have the kind of chemistry of people who love each other, but also relentlessly get on each other's nerves (and if you've seen "Two For The Road or are a fan of Sam and Diane, then you know that those are some of the best stories).  Don't rent this is you're looking for the typical boy meets girl formula.  Rent this if you want to hear great music (I'm buying the soundtrack immediately) and see Barbra's awesome acting chops (her character, Fanny Bryce is the kinda hard-nosed girl who says everything you'd want to say) this is an absolute must-see.
