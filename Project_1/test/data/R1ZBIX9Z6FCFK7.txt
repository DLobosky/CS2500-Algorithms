I had a pair of these a while back from a different company that would start to move a bit while I was running. Really irritating trying to get them to stay put between your toes inside of the running shoe - but these are a nice gel material that stay put no matter how long I run for. No more cramped toes from being smashed into a running shoe on a long-distance run - especially helpful for bunion pain during exercise.
