At the time of this review, I've read the other titles in this series as well, which are, in publication order: "New Tricks", "Unleashed", and "Play Dead".The series is set in present day San Francisco and follows the adventures of Mason and Louie. Mason is a mage, and Louie -- who looks like a miniature doberman -- is his familiar and magical companion.In Mason's world, there are light and dark magical practitioners living discreetly among mostly unsuspecting ordinaries, and a small number of them are lucky enough to have magical creatures called Ifrits, like Louie, that come to them out of nowhere and for unknown reasons to be their sidekicks.Over the centuries, practitioners have learned to live by a code of conduct, and have even formed loose enforcement organizations everywhere to police themselves. The San Francisco enforcement organization is headed by history professor Eli and wealthy martial-arts expert Victor, and Mason had been employed by them until he quit a number of years ago to pursue his real passion: music and guitar-playing with a jazz band.This novel opens with Mason getting attacked by a supernatural being in an eerily quiet street, while heading home after a late night music gig.  Just when Mason seems to be in dire straits, a small dog comes running to his aid, and Mason exclaims: "Louie! What took you so long!" The special bond between Mason and Ifrit Louie is laid bare for us right away, and makes us root for them.Mason reports this incident and subsequent attacks on him to his former boss Victor and mentor Eli. With their and additional help from ex-girlfriend Sherwood, who's also a practitioner, and other shadier characters, Mason makes some startling discoveries about a practitioner who used to have very little talent, but through some nefarious means, has been able to grow his powers by taking them away from others, and that practitioners like Mason are not the only ones in danger, but so are Ifrits also!  In fact, Mason almost loses Louie when the latter is severely injured in an attack, and Mason has to drive through a blizzard to somewhere near treacherous Donner Summit, which is hours out of San Francisco, to seek the help of a healer named Campbell, who manages to save Louie.The tale winds through more surprising twists and battles with mythical creatures, and culminates in a magic duel that pits Mason against this evil practitioner who has more powers than Mason.  Despite having shown great potential when he was still a youngster, Mason never did exert the effort to apply himself, to the disappointment of Eli and Victor.  Now faced with the battle for his life, Mason has only his wits and ability to improvise to call upon in this great battle.  Will he overcome the odds to defeat his enemy?This maiden novel strikes all the right chords to bring this urban fantasy series to a very good start: memorable and relatable characters, good and efficient world building, and believable but exciting battles between good and evil. The story is told from Mason's point of view which, given his passive-aggressive attitude against authority figures, and his sometimes unconventionalness, can give the narration the occasional funny turns, such as the time he finds himself howling with wolves "in harmony" that then magically effects his escape from an alternate universe he's been trapped in, bringing him back to the real San Francisco. We'll learn in subsequent installments that not only is music Mason's real passion, but it may actually play an important role in his and other practitioners' magical lives.Overall, I liked the quirkiness in this novel and I thought it was written imaginatively and well.
