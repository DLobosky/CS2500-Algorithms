(...) First, let me say what I do not like about the book. It is a coffee table sized book, with too many illustrations. It is too expensive (though I paid about half list with coupon). Some of the illustrations are really great, some are very funny, really, the only problem is that there are way too many, sometimes two pages. I did not realize this when I purchased the book. I thought it was like previous ones, just shorter. The size of the book makes it awkward to take places.....With that said, the writing style is pure Pratchett, very funny in places. It is not the best of the series, but perhaps in the top ten. I am almost finished with the book, and it actually is getting better as I go. I was not too happy with it at first, but there are at least 5 different times when I burst out laughing, and then re-read the paragraph and started laughing again. The characters are all old favorites, I just wish the story line did not jump around quite so much. For the price, the book deserves 3 stars. For the literary content a 5. The art work is great, but too much. So over all, I think a 4 is fair. If you are a die hard fan like me, you have to buy the book now. You can't wait. I know. I needed my fix right away. If you are not a die hard fan, I would suggest you wait until this ends up in the bargain bin/discount rack. At half the list price, I am happy. Anywhere close to list and I would have felt cheated. (Of course, this may be more personal than anything else). In any case, if you are reading this, you have already pretty much decided to buy the book, and are already one of the poor, addicted fools, like me. So, buy the book already and enjoy! ;-)
