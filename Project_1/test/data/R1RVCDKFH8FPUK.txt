I purchased this, the ageless night cream and the beeswax night cream. This moisture cream is going to perminently replace my oil of Olay night cream. I am a new convert to Burts. Great skin without the chemicals! I alternate this with the Ageless (which tightens). I also use the beeswax in small amounts after a facial steam. it really keeps the moisture in. All Burts night creams are great, priced right, and no "funny stuff" on your face!
