"I am Sterculius, you have offended me!"Edited = 0 stars.  I dare you, watch the Time Life Butt-O-Ween version of 'Late Night With Butt-Head' and then watch it missing almost 3 minutes of awesome footage in 'The Mike Judge Collection'. Same with '1-900-Beavis' and the end of 'Manners Suck' - I hate edits. I have a personal vendetta against edits.Interestingly enough, we now have the footage for the 'original' version of 'Home Improvement'. Allow me to explain:The Time Life version of 'Home Improvement' has had the paint thinner sniffing scene edited out, BUT 'The Mike Judge Collection' puts the sniffing scene back while CUTTING the beginning with Bill Clinton and the ending footage including Mr. Anderson saying to the cops, "I think they were oriental".We have all been betrayed by Mike Judge. I was watching B&B during the greatest and happiest years of my life (my early 20's) and now that I am bankrupt, alone, and depressed all I want are some old friends to get buzzed with. I miss B&B, the videos, and my all time favorites, 'Way Down Mexico Way' and 'Peace, Love, and Understanding'.  By the way, here is my personal list of edited DVD's in my collection -THE EDIT LIST:1 - The History of Beavis & Butthead (Recalled Paramount release edits 'Good Credit', 'Bedpans and Broomsticks', the beginning of 'Give Blood' and 'Door to Door' and other things)2 - Ren & Stimpy UNCUT (Of course, it is cut)3 - Married With Children Season 4 (7 edited episodes)4 - Tom & Jerry Collection 1 (Gee, why not alter our history for the next generation?)5 - Tom & Jerry Collection 2 (Mammy dubbed in 4 episodes)6 - The Blues Brothers (Theatrical Version edits a Belushi line)7 - Star Wars Eps IV, V, and VI (I would buy these all over again if I could get them completely uncut and original)8 - Blade Runner (Theatrical Version unavailable - cut version sucks!)9 - Time Life's 'There Goes The Neighborhood' (Edits thinner sniffing scene from 'Home Improvement')and now.....10 - Beavis & Butt-head: The Mike Judge CollectionThere oughtta be a law!
