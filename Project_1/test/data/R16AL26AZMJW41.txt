It's been a long while since reading a book as enjoyable as the latest from P. D. James - I relished very line, stayed up most of the night finishing it, and was sorry when it ended.  James has accomplished quite a feat that must be read to be appreciated - she has taken the characters from Jane Austen's heralded Pride and Prejudice and seamlessly crafted a murder mystery, a tale rich with suspense, excitement, and wit.	The story begins some time after the ending of Pride and Prejudice - long enough for Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet to become engaged, marry, have two children and seemingly have settled happily into life at Darcy's magnificent estate, Pemberley.  The year is 1803, the eve of the grand Lady Anne's ball, and the Bingley's have come.	Elizabeth is, of course, delighted to see her beloved sister, Jane, and the two are happily looking after final preparations for the ball when an unexpected visitor arrives - a carriage comes careening up the driveway carrying a woman who is screaming hysterically - none other than Lydia Bennet Wickham.  She married a handsome rogue who was well paid to make a respectable woman of her.  Now, her husband is soon discovered deep in the woodland, covered with blood,  bending over the dead body of his dear friend, Captain Denny.  Quite obviously, Denny has been viciously murdered (although we're treated to explanations from  local medical experts), and Wickham is charged with the crime.	There are many hidden secrets at Pemberley, including the life of Darcy's grandfather who built a cottage for himself in the woodland where he lived and died accompanied only by his faithful dog.  Now, the only residents of the woodland are the Bidwell's, a family headed by a man who has served Pemberley with pride  for many years.	It's sheer joy to follow James as she brilliantly traces the fate of Wickham and its effect upon Pemberley and all of its residents.  P. D. James and Jane Austen = superb reading .	- Gail Cooke
