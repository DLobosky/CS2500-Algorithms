Nagai suggested that a new series of his, 'Devilman' might be just what they were looking for. This marked the beginning of a 38-episode run that was not only a success, but also set an indelible stamp on Japanese horror for some time to come. Twenty-five years later, in 1997, Go Nagai's dark, twisted, and polymorphously perverse images were reborn in a different guise. This time as 'Devilwoman.'Jun Fudou is a successful fashion model, lushly attractive and in demand. Her best friend is young Kazumi Takiura, another model who, for a younger generation. Into this happy-go-lucky life-style intrudes Lan Asuka a member of the mysterious 'human alliance.' Asuka tricks Jun into a confrontation with a demonic creature, and the model discovers that she also has demonic powers, and perhaps, relishes the killing. At least until she returns to human form. As the episodes progress, Asuka explains that Jun is 'neotenic' - progressing toward devil-hood, but still retaining her human soul.From this point on the story continues to develop unexpected complexities.  At first a 'use a monster to skill monsters' story it quickly becomes clear that Jun is more than a little horrified by her own transformation.  Her encounters with Jason Bates, who shares her heritage makes it ever clearer that she cannot leave her humanity behind any more than Jun can now relinquish the power of her new form.  And Asuka's cold use of Jun's powers make it clear that what appears to be human agendas are no better than the demonic agendas that oppose them.The struggle within Jun will be replicated in the world about her as the demonic comes into direct conflict with the human.  But nothing is as it seems, and the viewer must be careful not to leap to too many judgments.  A war is being fought over the future of the world, and everyone is suspect.  Jun and Asuka represent opposites in a struggle for power where good and evil seem alarmingly similar.Go Nagai's style is a bit rough hewn, but the strength of the story quickly transcends the simplistic, somewhat retro artwork.  Nagai uses the contrast between the beautiful and the horrific to generate tension, and does not hesitate to use sensuality and violence.  This is a series for a mature viewer.  The questions it asks are sometimes confusing, and the answers are often ambivalent, but the overall effect is of a compelling story of a dark and heroic struggle.Two technical issues keep this from being an enthusiastic recommendation. First, the art and animation are completely retro in look. It seems a shame that 1997 technology should be used to recreate a 25-year-old 'low-fi' look. So much of the action is put in the shadows that it is almost impossible to make out what is happening, occasioning much fiddling with the contrast and brightness settings. The worst sin, though, is the English dubbing. I have seen plenty of anime where the dubbing is weak or clumsy, but this is the first time that I felt the English script was completely misleading. Stick to the Japanese with subtitles for a much more enjoyable and sensible experience.
