The key to me was viewing angle, and this TV has it.  Not every LED LCD is created equal when it comes to the viewing angle but LG delivers.  It does not wash out as you go from side to side it is very much like my plasma TV in that respect.  It is sleek looking with its shiny black bezel.  It is thin, modern looking, and lightweight all pluses in my book.  It arrived fast, packaged securely, and delivered in one piece.  The set up on the bedroom table was quick and easy.The menus for setup are easy to follow and give you a lot of options for viewing and listening pleasure.  You can choose one of the preset options or make your own user options for both viewing and listening.  I strongly recommend going through the Picture Wizard screening when you are setting up the TV in the beginning.  It is easy to do and makes a difference in the end.   The picture quality is sharp and spectacular!  I have mine hooked up to cable TV.  The HD channels are incredible.  The SD channels are still fine and watchable.  The colors are rich.  One neat thing I found after using the auto-channel feature is that when you punch in a channel on the remote it goes into a search mode and it displays on the screen a boxed list of channels that are similar in number to what you are punching in on the remote.  It reminds me a little bit like a google search where it gives its best guess at what you are searching for.  If there is a HD version of the channel you are looking for that is usually highlighted first on the list and it is a simple click on the ENTER button to grab that channel.  Anyhow I find it to be a cool, smart,  and useful feature that you won't see in the  product description.  I like the remote.  The thing I like most about it is the number keys are large, easy to read,  and it is easy to punch in channel numbers which is helpful when I am lying in bed and the room is basically dark.  The only thing that would have been better would have been a lighted remote which this is not.  The volume and channel up/down buttons are easy to "feel" in the dark too.  I like the FAV (favorites) button which will display in a list box all of your favorite channels which you can highlight using the up/down arrows and choose your channel.  There is also an aspect ratio button to make the picture fill the screen if needed.  Now about the audio.  I am not going to go into a judgement on that since I hooked this TV up to my PC speakers/subwoofer.  All I will say is this TV has larger speakers than most TVs of this size, and they sounded OK for all of the fifteen minutes or so that I heard them before hooking up my own speakers.  It does not have a lot of bass on its own, but was not overly tinny sounding either.  That is as far as I will comment on this.  For those interested, I hooked up this TV to the Logitech Z-2300 speaker/subwoofer which I got on sale here at amazon during the Christmas season and they are spectacular sounding.  Read my review of them if you want.Another cool thing is the energy saving setting.  Sometimes I am listening to the music channels so I dim the screen while listening very convenient.Bottom line, this is an excellent small flat panel TV, my first LG ever, and a great first impression by LG.
