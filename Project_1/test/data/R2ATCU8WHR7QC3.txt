Visually stunning, with a great soundtrack and wonderful music, it unfolds like an interactive fantasy movie experience.You are thrust into a war in Damara in the shoes of Rannek, a fighter.  Soon, you meet a rouge named Zhai and a sorcerer who goes by the name of Illius.  The three characters have a great interplay with the dialogue and the subtle ways that they interact, be it in a cutscene or in the midst of battle.The script has been penned by R.A. Salvatore (my reason for buying it) a great writer and a master of the genre.  The story is cohesive and held togetther by little tidbits and information that is revealed as you progress through the levels.The story is told in chapters, and there are 10 in all, after completing a chapter, you can unlock bonuses like concept art and backstory for the game.Now on to the stuff that wasnt so great.  While the game was awesome in the graphics department and ease of control, it fell short in a few areas.  First and foremost, the game was way too short.  I beat the whole thing in 9 hours.  Super short, and that leaves one feeling short-changed, especially at the current price for the game at 49 bucks.While the controls were easy to master, most of the time it felt like I was just button mashing.  In fact the whole game, I never used Illius' charm spells to hold monsters or make them fall alseep.  While you can switch between the players on the fly, I found myself confined to the role of Rannek most often...the fighter needed to constantly save the other characters from battle.  Another thing that kinda irked me was the level upgrade system.  If you got a good ability or spell, it would be overwritten the next time you leveled up, and you could not use it again. Example: Once Illius learns lightning, you cant cast a fireball anymore.  Minor, but it adds to the overall experience of feeling cheated.Dont get me wrong, I LIKE this game, I am a fan of Salvatore, and that is the main reason that I bought the game, I just wish it had been longer and more involved than it was.  Sometimes I get a little tired of button mashing and fighting a boss monster for like 30 minutes straight.  The game held up nicely to my attention span, mainly because of the storyline, I know that I keep stressing the storyline...but in all honesty that is what holds the whole game together and saves it from being a total loss.  The ending is nice and heroic, but obviously left open for a sequal or two...lets hope the next games in the series are longer and dont have the problems of the this first outing.  If Atari and Stormfront play thier cards right, they could have a killer franchise on their hands.  Buy this game if you are a fan of Salvatore or Forgotten Realms in general (you will see some familiar faces) but if you are a game player looking for a fantasy game, rent it first.  See how far you get and how long it takes you to get there...let that be the basis of your decision wether to buy or not.  Mixed bag folks...give it a spin...you will like it despite its shortcomings.  And thats a good thing.
