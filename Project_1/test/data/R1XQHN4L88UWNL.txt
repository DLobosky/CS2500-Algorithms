If romance novels are aimed for straight women who are reading it for temperature raising romance, alpha males and sexy men, why are so many of the covers with just half naked or totally naked women??  So I thought this cover meant a story that was going to be paranormal, romantic, alpha male loving adventure.  Wrong.The story was an intriguing setup, but it was poorly executed.  Since when do Greek immortal warriors talk like contemporary trash talking doofuses?  The conversations among the immortals sounded like dimwitted high school jocks.  The introduction of the heroine was ridiculous.  She is supposed to be an educated woman, but her "special" gift and her choice to seek relief from these Lords of the Underworld was incredibly inane. The use of the human female hostages took the story to even lower levels of stupidity.When we paranormal romance fans have writers of the caliber of Kelley Armstrong, Patricia Briggs and JR Ward, no one should waste their time with this series.
