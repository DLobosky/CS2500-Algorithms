When I encounter a species I cannot identify, I take notes (usually of the mental variety) -- size, color and markings, habitat, song, feeding habit and so forth -- and identify it when I return home. So far as I can recall, the Audubon guide has yet to fail me, although one has to admit that sometimes all the guidebooks in the world aren't going to resolve the identity of some distant LBJ (little brown job). I have another guidebook that supposedly focuses more narrowly on 'local' birds (San Diego area) but I strongly prefer the more thorough and useful Audubon volume. The photos, drawings and range maps are all generally excellent.Could the book be better? Well, the obvious answer is always yes, I suppose, but I don't know how. Would some kind of a 'flow-chart' for identifying specimens improve this edition? Well, there is one, created quite simply in the way the book is organized; refer to the "How to Use this Guide" section in the front. I won't claim to be a connoisseur of guidebooks, but this one has worked very nicely for me for several years and I recommend it without hesitation.
