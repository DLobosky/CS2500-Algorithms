This book, and all of Christopher Hitchens' books for that matter, are perhaps the most irrelevant and yet most interesting books written on current history. Yes, Hitchens is extremely bright (even in an extremely bright profession) , controversial, radical, iconoclastic, informed, experienced, and still very very irrelevant. One time he is taking on Mother Teresa, then appearing as a huge liberal on C-SPAN against his conservative British brother, then he turns up on Charlie Rose saying he is a libertarian, then he writes regularly for The Nation (while preferring globalization), and finally he applauds an article in National Review or the Weekly Standard. This latest book is the most scattered of all amounting to little more than a general pep talk about how to keep up your radical credentials, or, how to be Christopher Hitchens. Being so cool and intellectual and affected may be good for ones' career but how does it really help the reader who time and again is given only the choice of voting for a Democrat or Republican?  In the beginning there was Thomas Jefferson arguing for freedom and Alexander Hamilton arguing for Government. Today the Democrats and Republicans are arguing about the same issue, while Mr. Hitchens is oddly arguing about something else not even defined, let alone on the ballot? Why doesn't he write a book on why Trent Lott and Sam Daschel have spit the United States gov't along stupid or irrelevant lines? In truth, the more relevant and central an issue is to World history the more Mr. Hitchens stays away from it. So, if you want to be a proud but harmless radical, read this book. But, please consider that when you are done, like Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild Ones&quot; you'll still have to figure out what it is that you want to be radical about, if that should matter to you at all. Perhaps in an existential world &quot;cool&quot; has a value all by itself? If you want to read a book that seeks to be relevant as much as this book seeks to avoid it try &quot;Understanding The Difference Between Democrats And Republicans&quot;
