I bought these to store double sided DVD discs. Keeping TV programs in their original packaging took up too much room on my shelves and the hubs broke too easily. So far I'm happy with them. The disc fits in without struggling, even to get them out, and without the plastic window I know the disc is only touched by paper. Only time will tell if this paper will affect the disc. I'm hoping that my guess is they won't.
