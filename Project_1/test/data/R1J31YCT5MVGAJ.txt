for just over $20 you cant really ask for more, came in a ghetto bubble wrap bag, which worried me as to if it was in good shape, the box was pretty beat up too. installed the drive on my computer, and has been working great since, comes with nero 9 essentials, some mounting screws, and a sata cable, which is a nice.great for the price, if you need just a cd/dvd writer drive that gets the job done for a low price, this is a good choice.UPDATE4/5/2011: well its still working just fine, though i have maybe used the drive a total of 15 times since I installed it months ago, mostly to watch movies. given that most software these days can be downloaded to and installed without an optical drive makes it almost useless to have a DVD/CD drive. You will definitely need the drive to install Windows easily, but beyond that, the only real use for it is to play DVD movies. you cant really make drives much cheaper than this though, even floppy drives are still around $10-20 these days.Build:ASUS M4A89GTD PRO/USB3 - AM3 - AMD 890GX - DDR3 - USB 3.0 SATA 6 Gb/s - ATX MotherboardAMD Athlon II X4 640 Propus 3.0 GHz 4x512 KB L2 Cache Socket AM3 95W Quad-Core Processor - Retail ADX640WFGMBOXCorsair 4GB Dual Channel Corsair DDR3 Memory for Intel Core i5 Processors (CMX4GX3M2A1600C9)OCZ OCZ550FTY Fatal1ty Series 550W Power SupplyWestern Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 16 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD5000AAKSThermaltake V5 Black Edition Mid-Tower Gaming Chassis VL70001W2Z (Black)Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98 - Retail (Black)
