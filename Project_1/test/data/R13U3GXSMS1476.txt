Exactly the same as original fuel filter unit on my 2002 Mazda protege5. Filter located underneath passenger seat on driver side. You'll also need strainer and quick release tool for installation. Filter acts as fuel pump housing so you'll have to transfer pump to new filter. There's a rubber fitting on the original filter that you will have to make sure is placed on new filter as well, located where fuel pump attaches to filter.
