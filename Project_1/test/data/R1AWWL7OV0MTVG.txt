In my GameCube days, a multiplayer game was something like Mario Golf, Mario Kart or Mario Tennis.  I didn't really have any inclination to think I would enjoy Rayman Raving Rabbids, but I had been reading so many great reviews saying that this was THE game to get for the Wii.So I picked it up, and it's probably my favorite Wii game right now.  The biggest thing about it that I enjoy is the humor.  Many of the games aren't particularly engaging by themselves, but the way they are presented to you is hilarious.  The behavior and especially the sounds for the Rabbids are hysterical.The single player game is in the format of a gladiatorial arena.  In the opening sequence of the game, Rayman is captured by the Rabbids and thrown into a coliseum-like stadium in front of a crowd of jeering Rabbids.  You're presented with five doors, one of which is locked until you beat at least three of the other challenges.  The challenges generally fall into four categories ranging from precision (requiring you to have good control of the remote/nunchuk) to dancing (where you have to shake the controllers along with the beat of a song to inspire Rabbids to dance).  If you beat three challenges, you unlock the middle door that leads to the "boss" level, which is usually either a shooter or a race.  If you complete all four challenges, you also unlock a song or costume option.  After you beat the "boss" level, you get "escorted" back to your cell where you can change costumes, listen to the music you've unlocked, review and replay the series of challenges you just played, and even plot your way out of the evil Rabbids' clutches.Once you start completing challenges in the single-player game, you can go back to play them in a challenge mode to try and get the best score in a single-player mode or play up to 4 players in a variety of vs. or co-op modes.  After each game in this mode, you're presented with a web code that you can enter at Ubisoft's Rayman website that enters you into the world rankings.  My one gripe with this is, why doesn't the game simply contact the Rayman site directly if an internt connection is available?  It's a big hassle to write down the code, then run into the other room where the computer is to enter the code.  Luckily for me I have a laptop, so I can have the laptop open right next to me, but that's not always practical for everyone.The minigames (and there are about 100 or more of them) themselves are generally very short... no more than 2-3 minutes or so for the longest ones, with some of them being under 15 seconds (though the shorter ones are typically the ones that require more control, so they're a bit harder, and you'll probably try them over and over again).  Each one has a clever title, like "Bunnies don't know what to do with cows" on a mission where you have to twirl a cow above your head on the end of a chain and throw it for distance.  Some of the games are actually physically exhausting... after playing a few of the missions your arms will feel like Jell-O.For someone who originally had no interest in the "minigames" genre of video games, I really love this game.  Whenever someone comes over or we take the Wii with us somewhere, we generally pull out Wii Sports first, just because it gives people a chance to get the hang of the Wii controllers, but then we switch to Rayman and the real fun begins.
