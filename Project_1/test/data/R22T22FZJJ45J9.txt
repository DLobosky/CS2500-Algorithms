Decent speakerphone audio quality, especially with the handsets. Above average.Cons:1. No hold button. If you are using the base and want to go to a portable handset, you have to use the intercom transfer feature to call a handset (assuming you know which one you want and where it is), but after picking up the handset, the base doesn't disconnect automatically unless someone is there to do so. You then get a awlful feedback untill you 'hang up' the base speakerphone.2. No message indicator (you can't see from a distance if there are any messages). Only a very small message counter that is hard to see. The 'beep' function is very soft and can only be heard nearby if it is quiet.3. Function buttons text size is small on the base. 4. No menu navivation control like the handset has on the base.5. The time/day has to be reset if you loose power even though there are batteries in the base.
