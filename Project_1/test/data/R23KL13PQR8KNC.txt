Meet The Temptations is the debut release from the great Motown quintet. The band was originally known as The Primes (The Supremes were the Primettes) and they were a quartet.  All but one of the songs on the album were recorded in that form and it showcases the underappreciated vocal talents of Paul Williams.  While the band is best known for Eddie Kendricks' ringing falsetto and David Ruffin's silky smooth voice, Mr. Williams was the backbone of the group.  His voice is gruffer and grittier than Mr. Ruffin's, but it is filled with emotion.  Songs like &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Further You Look, The Less You See&quot; and &quot;Slow Down Heart&quot; show the man's ability.  Berry Gordy thought the band had potential, but wasn't commercial enough, so David Ruffin was added to the band.  Mr. Gordy as usual was right as Mr. Ruffin put the band over the top and his only appearance on this album, &quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot; was the group's first hit song peaking at number 11 on the charts and is a great song.
