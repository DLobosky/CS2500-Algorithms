The item description states that the Norcent DP300 has &quot;Manual voltage select (AC 100 to 240 volts, 50 or 60 Hz) lets you use the player in several countries&quot; and states that is ideal for taking with you on vacation to Europe.This is not true. The unit does not have a manual voltage selectso you can only use it in the US.
