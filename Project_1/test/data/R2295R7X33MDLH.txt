People are always asking him for advice! She has been a bit confused since asking him for help with her weekly spelling list. How can her very smart dad struggle with one of her spelling words? This definitely didn't make sense. the word Mississippi has changes everything...This is one of four books in a series about children who learn differently. Each of the books explains different learning challenges (dyslexia, difficulty with timed tests, handwriting and ADD) in kid friendly lingo without talking down to the children.What I liked about the book:  It is a great book for explaining dyslexia to students who have been diagnosed with dyslexia or who may have classmates with it.  I loved it when Katie's dad pointed out that " . . . dyslexia does not mean a person isn't smart.  In fact some of the greatest scientists, doctors, and inventors struggled with symptoms of dyslexia."  As an educator and librarian, my heart just swelled when Katie asked her mom to take her to the library so she could learn more.  Young readers will be able to see themselves in this story, either as Mark Twingle, who can't spell anything or as Katie who had the wrong idea about Mark.  At the end of the story, the author has included additional resources for parents and teachers.What I didn't like about the book:  I liked it all. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a child who learns differently.  It's a must addition to any school/classroom library.Recommended for ages 6 and up.AR Reading Level: Not listed on AR.Mrs. Archer's Rating: 5 of 5!
