Of course no one should have expected this one to be as "good" as the first.  With all the hype and originality of the first Blair Witch, this one was inherently going to be tough to follow.  In the sequel's defense, however, I really found this one to be better than I expected.  There are more than a few scenes and moments that were surprisingly original, and the ending was clever.  I have actually seen this a few times now (not in the least due to the attractive Goth character LOL), and it's still an interesting viewing. I'd definately recommend it for the horror fan in your life.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...
