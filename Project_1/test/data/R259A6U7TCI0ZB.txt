This film is a cult classic and well deserving of that status.  It's one of my favourite films and for YEARS we were promised the excised footage would be replaced and we could finally see this marvellous film in the form Billy Wilder meant it to be.  Well, I am sure like all fans of the film, we waited with hope that NOW they would include all these scenes.  And while the film transfer is great and I was sad to see there is NO footage to speak of to be added.  There are snippets of film of other adventures, stills flashed over a poor soundtrack, but according to MGM there is no extra scenes, they have been lost.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!The film is still a must for Billy Wilder, Robert Stephens, Chris Lee or Sherlock Holmes Fans.  But just do not expect all the lost footage to be restored.It is a very very funny look at Holmes, a more human look perhaps.  This is a mirthful look at the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, lovingly portrayed with a twinkle in his eye by the late great Sir Robert Stephens. The adventures are fun (the ones we see) but mainly centre around a woman's missing husband. Toss in several hundred canaries, the Loch Ness Monster, missing midgets - the Tumbling Pickaloes to be precise - the mysterious red runner, Queen Victoria, some Trappist monks, an ageing ballerina that does not 'look 39' - that is because she is 49!! -who wants Holmes to father her child and an amnesiac damsel in distress that temps Holmes, all done with the best British wit and droll sense of humour...and you have a mix that cannot miss.Incisive writing and direction, this fill pay homage to Holmes and Watson, with tongue firmly planted in cheek...Even so, the currently version is a true gem, and so overlooked,all we have left of Billy Wilder genius vision.
