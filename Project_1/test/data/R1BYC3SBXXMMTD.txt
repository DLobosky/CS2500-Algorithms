I read "In Her Name" and decided to try "Confederation". It was a good book, but just that good. It was not as good as the first one. I understand that writers of series such as these have a hard time keeping the plot flowing so as to go into the next book. Mr. Hicks did a okay job and I did enjoy this one.
