Unfortunately, I just could not get it to work.The problem is that it would not acquire an IP address by DHCP from my ISP, Verizon FiOS.  Using the same MAC address didn't help, neither did making sure the IP was released from the old router before connecting the new one. I had an old Netgear router around and it got an IP immediately, as did my notebook when I connected it directly.  I returned the DIR-655 and got a second unit - same exact problem.D-Link support was polite and tried to help, but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful.  A web search revealed that this model has a history of DHCP IP acquisition problems, though not everyone sees it. I read reports of a European firmware update that resolved the problem for some, but it didn't for me.I've never encountered a router problem like this before, and have had probably six or seven over the years.  Sadly, I returned the 655 for a refund and will keep looking.I know that many are very happy with this product, even those using Verizon FiOS, but just be aware that you may be as unlucky as I was.Edit: December 2008.  I decided to try again, this time with the DIR-825 (simultaneous dual-band and some added features I liked.)  Same problem - no DHCP.  This time, D-Link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem, which was that the router failed to "auto-negotiate" the Ethernet link speed from my FiOS optical network block.  No other router or PC I had tried had such a problem.  The second-level support rep had me change the speed to 10Mbps (instead of the default 10/100/1000 auto) and it worked.Well, sort of.  What's the point of a 15Mbps service with a 10Mbps Ethernet link?  Could I set it to 100Mbps?  Yes.  Did it work?  No.  But I then had a think.  I grabbed an Ethernet switch I had elsewhere in the house and put that between the FiOS connection and the router.  Success!  The switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a GigE link.  So off to local store I go and I find the same model Netgear GigE switch on sale for $30.  Install that and I'm in business.If I had realized this when I had the DIR-655 I might have stuck with it, but that does raise the price by 30%.  If the DIR-655 does the auto-negotiation for you properly, then that's great.  If not, you can install a switch or look for another brand.  I conclude that the Ethernet transceiver D-Link uses is not as good as that of other brands.
