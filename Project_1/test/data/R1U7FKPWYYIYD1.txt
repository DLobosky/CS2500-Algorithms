I actually bought this, not for the iPod/iPad connection but for a floor mounted powered speaker for a flat screen TV in a garage. I could not really use one of the soundbars like you would inside the house, so thought I would try this to get better sound then the lousy speakers that come with a LED TV. The only input available on the Pyle is a RCA input and I wanted to use a digital optical Toslink output from the TV, so I ended up coming out of the TV with the digital optical Toslink cable to a converter box that converted it to a RCA cable for input to the PYLE, here is the box: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009AGTC3Q/ref=oh_details_o06_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It worked great actually and the sound was not distorted, nor was there any delay where the TV didn't match perfectly to the sound as was my fear.As to the PYLE features and sound, it has a very good base/subwoofer that should be more then enough for anyone. For music it sounds fine, but for TV or any talking like on FM radio, the high notes are really not great. I think they needed a couple of more tweaters in it. You can adjust the Subwoofer volume, the base and treble on the PYLE directly but it still was not great for listening to movies, talk radio, etc. One thing that is missing also is a quick way via the remote to turn base or treble up or down, it is more of a menu function that takes too much time to be constantly changing depending on your listening needs, that would be a nice feature.Also, when listening, you have 3 choices on input, Aux (which is your RSA input jacks, in my case the TV), FM, and the iPod/iPad dock, you can toggle easily all 3 on the remote. The FM and iPod/iPad Dock are all at a consistent volume level but when I switch to AUX for listening to TV, the volume level is much lower, thus I have to turn up the volume to very high close to max level and remember to turn it down before switching the input to the other two or it blasts you away.The remote works find, but I ordered another from Pyle by calling their parts department to have a backup, $15 plus shipping.Setup was easy, unpack, and put a little base stand on the bottom with 3 screws, it took 3 minutes. My iPod and iPad work fine and there is a little stand behind them that hold them in place, it seems pretty secure.The unit is big, but not too big and it looks cool actually, I got the black glossy model.Overall it is decent, depending on what you want it for. If it is for music, it should be fine, not really hi fidelity because of the tweaters but decent still and very acceptable. For TV, I would suggest they improve the sound quality, I end up turning on the PYLE for the base, then still use my TV's speakers for the high notes and talking. They could also include a TOSLINK input that would make it nice, but the workaround device did the job.
