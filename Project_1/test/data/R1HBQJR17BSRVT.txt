You can watch a DVD while recording your favorite episode of "Friends", or "ER", or a another movie from Turner Classics. It also can be used to play your CD's(One at a time). And it presents a very nice picture and great sound through your Home Theatre System. It is compatiable with both Dolby Digital and DTS. Hi-Fi VHS recordings also sound great.For the most part, it will automatically track your VHS for you and will also let you know if a cleaning is necessary.There are a few little things about it that make me a  hesitant to give it a superior or even an above average rating. My major complaint would be that every once in a while, about every 10th DVD or so, the screen will all of a sudden go to green. The only way to get back to the movie is to turn the power off, then back on , let the DVD reload, go to scene selection, and pick up where you left off. I thought at first, it may be the DVD itself, but I restarted the films shortly before the interuption occurred, and found the DVD played fine the second time around. It's not a big deal, I guess, but certainly interupts the flow of a storyline. I use a lens cleaner occasionally, so I know that dirt was not the problem. Other little things would be that the disc tray is very slow to open(may not be important unless you are impatient like me), and as another reviewer pointed out fast fowarding and rewinding of tapes is a little on the noisey side.The instruction manual is pretty thorough. It's a 91 page booklet, that should answer all your questions. It gives you instructions and diagrams for setting up and wiring for any type of connection you want to make. Whether you use cable, satellite, or just an antenna, whether you are using S-Video or are lucky enough to have Progressive Scan, it will take you step by step. The manual is pretty easy to follow if you have ever set up a DVD player or home theatre system before. If it is your first time, you made need some help, as there are times it seems the instructions assumes you know what they are talking about. Basic recording and Timer programming is also covered. The Combo unit also has MP3 and JPEG playback with detailed instructions as well. I don't use these, so I can't report on that aspect. There's a trouble shooting section, which answered some of my questions before I panicked, a question and answer section, an index with a list of terms and pages, and a limited warranty(1 Yr parts/90 day labor). There is also some phone numbers, one for JVC Americas Corp and a toll free number for service locations.The remote does everything but pop the popcorn for you, but you really need to keep the manual handy until you get the feel for it.I would say, if you find a really good deal on this unit, it's worth it for all it's capabilities, the great quality picture and sound it presents, and thinning out the amount of wires plugged in(I have never had A DVD player that didn't eventually have some little problem). Keeping in mind, that if one function does not work, the whole unit will have to go in for repair,this may be nice to have as second DVD player. I don't know if the problems I had(the green screen) is just my player, but if this is something that would annoy you, fahgetabout it!, there's many more to choose from out there.Three and a half stars for the whole package.Shop around....Laurie
