The first movie was based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett and teamed the great William Powell and wonderful Myrna Loy for the second time. Their first feature, also released in 1934, was "Manhatten Melodrama."  To say that the pair exuded chemistry is an understatement. Though the best of friends, Powell and Loy, were never romantically linked. This did not stop fans from believing that they were.  And why not, Powell and Loy managed to create an image of marriage that is as sexy as any courtship. In many romantic comedies,the dramatic tension ebbs when the romantic pair gets together. Powell and Loy manage to transcend this limitation, not only in these films, but also in seven others which run the gamut from comedy to melodrama.The Thin Man films also owe a great deal to the writing, Hammett continued to be somewhat involved in the early spin offs from the original, but the series also benefited from the scripts produced by Albert Hacket and Francis Goodrich, who were married in real life.  This point of view probably contributed to the success of series as a whole. This boxed set contains all of the movies in the series along with biographies of Powell and Loy.  There is also an episode of the 1950s TV series which only goes to show just how well the original film series was executed.The films range from excellent to good. The sixth film in the series probably is the weakest of the lot, It appears that the producers were attempting to inject elements of film noir into the light hearted detective series and this just does not work. However, Powell and Loy managed to turn in excellent performances which rise above the problems with the script and its execution.Probably the only thing that would make this boxed set better would be if it included the other seven films which starred Powell and Loy since they are always interesting, no matter what the subject matter.
