I simply loved watching this DVD.  While the sound quality was nothing more than mono, the black and white video quality was very good.  The only gripe I have about this DVD (and that for Season 1) is the lack of playtime of its theme song after every episode.  The theme song is great.  You only hear it once or twice on every disc.  This is a shame since the theme song only plays for about 30 seconds.  (Wash., D.C. Area).
