When I saw the trailer for this movie I was excited because of the great cast, and because it looked like it might be sort of mean/funny, but after seeing it I was disappointed.  It wasn't particularly funny (as the trailer led me to believe); in fact it was rather painful at times.  I thought the acting was terrific, though, even from Aniston, who I don't particularly like. (It was the other actresses who brought me in.) I did think some of the writing was spot-on (the blind date scene was priceless) and I think part of what I didn't like was that some of the situations the characters find themselves in mirrored my own life a little too closely and that was why the film bothered me.  I also felt that some of the men's parts were very underwritten and a little thankless. (Particularly Scott Caan and Jason Isaacs, both good actors who deserve better written parts.)  I felt that the whole movie was from the women characters' point of view and I would have liked a little more background on the men and their take on what was going on in the various relationships.  I realize the movie is supposed to focus on the women, but it just felt really unbalanced to me.  (I'm female.)  I thought Frances McDormand was great, but then she always is.  Ditto Catherine Keener.  Overall, I'd recommend this as a rental but with the caveat that it won't appeal to everyone.  It's not a happy film and you probably won't like it if you like movies where everything is tied up neatly at the end.  I think it could have used a rewrite and some fleshing out of some scenes and maybe a little back story on some of the relationships.  This is hard to do in a "slice of life right now movie" but some writers are able to do it.  All in all, not a great movie but not a bad one either.
