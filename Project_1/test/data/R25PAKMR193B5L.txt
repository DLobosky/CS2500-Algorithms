Not one word was said between us as we sat utterly mesmerized by the extraordinary Idris Elba, the excellent, hypnotic acting of Ruth Wilson, a smart, sophisticated complex script that generated so much tension (think Alfred Hitchcock) and by far, the nastiest, creepiest, and scariest villains as only the British can write.  This series is so popular that NetFlix has run of out them, and I have been waiting 3 weeks for the DVD's to view the complete series.
