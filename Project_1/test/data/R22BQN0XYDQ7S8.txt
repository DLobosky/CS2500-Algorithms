I bought this kit to upgrade to 16 gigs of RAM from an identical (though black colored) kit.  Corsair remains the premier memory manufacturer. This went into a ASUS P67 board and showed up immediately with no problems. I get a 7.9 in the Windows Experience Index and real world performance is outstanding. This kit is also an exceptional overclocker given the low 1.5v and the XMP certification. The custom heatsinks do very well to keep the memory cool and I have never had problems with heat even when overclocked.
