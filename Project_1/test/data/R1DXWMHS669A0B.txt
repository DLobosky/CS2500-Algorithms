The laws of magic were discovered early (contagion--things in contact remain in contact) are prevalent.  Lots of allusions and puns: for instance the head of the sourcer's guild is Sir Lyons Grandalopuhs Gray, and the Too Many magicians is something of a send up of  the Before Midnight: A Nero Wolfe Mystery (Mystery Masters Series) mysteries are still popular and I highly recommend them.  A very good attempt to apply the codified laws of magick to an imaginary world and an excellent series of deceive stories.  Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe is paralleled by the Marquis of London and while Nero Wolfe's side kick is Archie Goodwin the Marquis' is Lord Bontriomphe.  In another story a man is killed and the Kaplin-Sheinwold (bridge writers) test shows that a short club (bridge convention) could not have been used.Overall a great read with compelling well done characters, excellent plots and nice sometimes sly humor.
