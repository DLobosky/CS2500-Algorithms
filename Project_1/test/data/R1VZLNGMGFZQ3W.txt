It is best to say the least possible about the plot, but this sees Blomkvist return to a more prominent role, even if Salander remains the series' heroine. A strong and rewarding ending.The Millennium trilogy was only published posthumously. Stieg Larsson was a journalist and left-wing activist, though he also produced science-fiction short stories in his youth as co-editor of a sci-fi magazine. Larsson died in 2004 of a heart attack. Apparently he had money troubles but had long said that money did not bother him, since he could always write a few thrillers and make a success out of it. Sadly, he had yet to publish the Millennium novels when he died, and he never knew the huge international success they have become.
