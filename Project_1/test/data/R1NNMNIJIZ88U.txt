OK, I have said it all before.  I love this series. Laurell should have emailed me and said read this.   I do acknowledge it is load to read, one must almost study it. There are so many creatures, and magic and new information/history with each novel.   I love it.  Book four covers just one wild day, as before, if you are into faeries, goblins, and sex, blood and action with loads of magic and faerie history, this is your series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
