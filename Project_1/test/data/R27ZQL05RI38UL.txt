I have had the original CRT iMac, and then the swivel arm LCD iMac that followed. The current G5 iMac is the best of the bunch. The widescreen LCD is sharp and bright, and affords a large viewing area. It is quiet and fast, however Apple is a bit skimpy with the standard RAM, 512mb is the absolute least you should have in this machine. Thankfully, adding additional ram is simple.MAC OS X 10.4 Tiger is an awesome operating system; everything looks great, and runs smoothly. No crashes, no viruses, and no worries that something you've been working on for the last 2 hours will be lost if you forget to save. Almost all of the necessary programs are available for MAC as well; Microsoft Office, most Adobe products, and quicken. Also, the iLife suite of software than came with system is great.My only caveats are with front row and the wireless keyboard and mouse. Front Row is sometimes slow to operate and frequently loses connection with the Movie Trailer server, and the apple wireless keyboard and mouse I have with my iMac sometimes loose their connection, and the mouse is still only one button, while Apple's Mighty Mouse is a four button.Overall, I love the Macintosh operating system, and the iMac G5. After using them at work for so many years and loving them, I finally replaced my home computer, a DELL with an Apple PowerMac G5.About the Intel switch.Recently a friend of mine said he had the ability to try a prototype Mac with the new Intel chips. He said the chip was a dual core 4.0 Ghz in a PowerMac. He felt that the system performance seemed no faster that the current G5 PowerPC chip. One more reason not to wait for Intel.
