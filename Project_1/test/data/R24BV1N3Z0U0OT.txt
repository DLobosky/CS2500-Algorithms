The 16 words are: above, Jake, down, out, eat, there, he, time, hi, to, hiding, under, in, up, is and where. On each page your child can find Jake who always seems to be out of sight of his owners in their backyard. And like any dog Jake shows up when it's time for food!A great book to give your beginning reader confidence! Nicely illustrated!
