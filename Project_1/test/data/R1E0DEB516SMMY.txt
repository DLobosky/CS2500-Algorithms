This is THE main reason to buy this product.  Ditch the standard earbuds and buy some decent cans -- you will be blown away by the sound quality. It has an EQ and the JetEffects are excellent.  But yes, you will need to do some tweaking to get it to your liking.- Customization.  You can use it in a database format that requires accurate tags (like the Zune / Ipod's utilize), or direct folder access.   I prefer the latter, myself.   There is also an active fan base who have created their own themes and flash skins, for the product.   It does require a bit of technical know-how on the part of the user, so if that interests you it's there.- SDHC slot, for future expandability.    It will show up as two drive letters in Windows, as others have mentioned.  In Linux, it will be two separate mount points.- Cross-platform.   Linux / Mac users rejoice - but, the only problem is that you can't use the included software.  Of course you can use alternative software to your liking.- Battery life.  50 hours is pretty accurate, for music.BAD:- Still no gapless support (if that's a concern for you).- Support.  Cowon is no Apple, as far as support is concerned.- Zero accessories.  Not really Cowon's fault, but something to keep in mind.  If you have to have accessories galore, you're better off with an iPod.COULD GO EITHER WAY:- The bundled software.  This argument goes both ways, so YMMV.  I almost never use the bundled software for hardware like this, as they are never to my liking.- Video.   I find it usable, but the screen is small.   I use a separate conversion tool (WinFF) and I have no problems.   I feel it's a extra, but not its main strength - if video is critical for you, you might want to look at a player with a larger screen.- Touch interface.  Some people like it, some people hate it.  Personally, I think it could be a little better, but it's usable.Bottom line:  If you want more control over your music / video player, don't mind getting doing a little tweaking, and want fantastic sound quality, this player might be a good fit for you.
