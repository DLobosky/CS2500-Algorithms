I got this mouse a little over two years ago as a warranty replacement for my MX1000. I was hesitant and considered selling it and finding an old MX1000, but I'm happy I didn't.This mouse is awesome. The smart shifting scroll wheel is awesome. The dock is awesome.The wheel has two modes, click-to-click and free spin. Free spin puts the wheel into low friction mode where the wheel will continue spinning for long after letting go of the wheel. This makes scrolling long documents easy. You can even flick it to scroll at a low speed and quickly scan long documents for what you want.The only problems with this mouse are the default button mappings. Clicking the wheel results in it switching scrolling modes instead of middle clicking. By default the mouse doesn't have a middle click. The button under the wheel does a search on whatever text you currently have highlighted. I found this useless any annoying. Using uberOptions I remapped the wheel click to be middle click, and the search button to toggle wheel scroll mode between click-to-click and free spin.The thumb wheel is great since it has three functions (forward, back, click). Using UberOptions, I was able to configure it to be ctrl+tab, ctrl+shift+tab, and ctrl+1. What this did is allow me to switch tabs in my browser using my thumb.Unfortunately after just over two years, the left click button on this mouse is failing. Having tried out its "successor" I am extremely disappointed in Logitech wanting to replace it with a Performance Mouse MX. That mouse really can not compare. Take a look  at the highest rated comment on Amazon for it.This time I truly am considering selling my replacement as soon as I get it and attempt to track down a MX Revolution for a decent price. I wish I hadn't returned the MX Revolution I got for $40 from Best Buy while waiting for my MX Revolution that replaced my MX 1000.
