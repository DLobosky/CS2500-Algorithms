I loved the show from then on, but knew I would have to get caught up to know what was going on. I never watched an episode again for a long time (because I always worked when it was on). Recently one of my friends was telling me how great a show 24 is, and a store had the Seasons 1-4 on sale for $16, so I decided, why the hell not. I bought Seasons 1-3, and plan on buying 4, and then 5 when it comes out. This is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. You will litteraly get hooked on it, as you will want to know what is going to happen next. It's full of plot twists and will not put you to sleep, it is very good. I don't want to give any details for those that have not watched it, but it is about a Counter Terrorist Unit that is assigned to protect a Senator that is running for President from being assasinated--everything revolves around that.I highly recommend this show--it is an excellent series.  I just finished watching the entire Season 1, and now am off to Season 2.
