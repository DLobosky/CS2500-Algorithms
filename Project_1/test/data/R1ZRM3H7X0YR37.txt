I was originally introduced to a package of miso by way of a Gourmet magazine Thanksgiving Day recipe.  And I can now say:  Hey, this is great stuff!  It adds a lot of unique flavor to a dish, and I really like this flavor!  When we're talking umami, why aren't we talking miso, along with soy sauce and other products?  And it's good for you--at least it is if you don't kill the beneficial organisms by high heat.  So, I purchased this cookbook and "Miso Cookery" by Louise Hagler.If you can only purchase one book, I would go with this one, as it contains more general information about miso and its health benefits, there are a lot more recipes, and the overall presentation is a bit more sophisticated.There are more than the average amount of very nice dressing and sauce recipes.  And the soup recipes--what a great assortment of recipes that incorporate miso!  While there are some Japanese recipes and Japanese-inspired recipes, most of the recipes in this book are more, what I would call, "Continental", with an assortment that includes French Onion Soup and Boston Baked Beans.Positive/Negative:  The authors of this book are affiliated with "The American Miso Company", whose products I have not found locally.  And the type of miso is listed in English, with no Japanese equivalant.  This means that it's not real easy to go into your local Asian market and identify what you are looking for.  For those of you who choose your cookbooks by presentation, (how many pictures, quality of paper and cover material, etc.), you may not be real happy with this cookbook, as it has no pictures.  It is a real basic, average-quality publication and you may not be happy with it if you pay the full cover price of $15.95.  But if you want to add to the quality and "mystery" and umami of your cooking, this book is a worthwhile addition to your collection.
