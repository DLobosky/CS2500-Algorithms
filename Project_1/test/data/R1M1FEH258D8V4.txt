It's a world where Kate Daniels has to decide if she will chuck all her paranoia and self-protective ways to join humanity, find friends, love and community.  And in this installment, Kate has to deal with the consequences of her earlier choice to stop hiding from those that threaten her.  Well done characterizations, writing, plotting and et cetera.  In particular, the world building has me happy, as it's extremely well developed and not a cookie cutter reprise of other dark or urban fantasy landscapes.  Sure, there are similarities; there's no way a writer can be totally unique in an urban fantasy.  But you won't have read anything exactly like this near-future, magic-riddled Atlanta!Overall just a smashing read.  (I've read it eight times since I got it, I liked it that much...and it's only been a few weeks.)Do start with the first two installments, "Magic Bites" and "Magic Burns."  You'll love them!
