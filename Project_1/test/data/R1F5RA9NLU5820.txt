Sometimes all you want is a quiet moment alone, to reflect. To regroup. To sob quietly into your hands and wonder where it all went so wrong.Needless to say, I spend a lot of time in the john.Problem is, I'm not the only one. Maybe it's the recession -- or maybe it's the new 'Burrito Blowout' special in the cafeteria -- but lately the back stall in the mens' room has been more popular than the water cooler by the hot receptionist's desk. Every time I need a 'time out', there's some guy already back there. And probably pooping. I needed some way to keep the other guys away from my 'thinking chair'.There's nothing better for turning away unwanted riff-raff than a padlock. Or a bouncer -- but my goal was to keep guys OUT of the bathroom, not bring another one IN. And besides, velvet ropes would just look cheap standing next to a bank of urinals. So I went with the lock.This model is great, because it uses letters and you open it by spelling a word that you choose yourself. No more fumbling with a tricky dial or forgetting combinations. I latched it onto the toilet stall handle and prepared to enjoy "my own private poopin' hole".Unfortunately, my coworkers are more clever than I thought. The lock didn't even last the morning before the code was cracked and reset -- and now half the time I go in there, someone's locked themselves INSIDE the stall, enjoying their peace and quiet. Those conniving little devils.In retrospect, using 'DOODY' as the combination word for a toilet stall lock probably wasn't the best idea I've ever had.
