Led Zeppelin's excellent follow up second album is essential listening especially if you are into rock guitar wizardry.  Jimmy Page continues playing some excellent rock guitar here and shows why at one time he was the most requested session guitarist in the industry.  Tracks like "Whole Lotta Love", "Heartbreaker", "Living Loving Maid" and "Ramble On" are all classic rock standards.  Now, we get this album very well remastered and in a very nicely done mini-lp replica gatefold sleeve as well.  Great sound quality, great packaging, this is a must have in any classic rock lover's collection.  Highly recommended!
