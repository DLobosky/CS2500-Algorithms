These are 4W speakers, and they produce 4W of sound, they're impressively bassy, highs distort very quickly, so they're only useable at low-volumes. They're not audiophile-grade. They're very impressive for the size, but they're not a miracle (like so many reviews online will say). My biggest gripe is all of the over-exaggerated reviews. The ONLY IMPRESSIVE FEATURE IS THE SIZE; yes it sounds impressive for the size, but it's not impressive sound overall. If you want decent sound in a box the size of box for glasses, you've found it. If you think you're going to listen to jazz/classical on this and actually get into it, you're dreaming (and after reading reviews that compared these to 1000 dollar speakers, that's what I naively was expecting). They're OK to play little muzak in the corner. As far as sound analysis: there's quite a bit of bass for such a small package, but as expected it's quite boomy, mids are a little tinny (to be expected), and high don't extend quite as high as a dedicated tweeter... and obviuosly there's no stereo separation to speak of (unless you put them up against your nose). I'm not quite sure what exactly is Audiophile about these. They're small and quite an engineering feat, considering the frequency response, I personally wish they'd cut down on the bass, and gave it a little more clarity; instead of having try to produce all the bass and garble up mids and highs in the process.
