If you are in the mood for a nimble caper film, with great locations, inventive heists, some spiffy chase scenes and loaded with a terrific cast, pick this one up.Really. Grab a tub of popcorn and enjoy.F. Gary Gray makes good-looking, smart movies. And they always seem to be better than you originally gave them credit for. I'll tell you I personally won't be making that mistake again.The cast is perfect eye candy. They look great delivering tasty lines. Donald Sutherland adds his gravitas. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron will keep appropriate hormones percolating briskly. Seth Green offers his brand of geek cred, and I mean that in the best way. Mos Def continues to surprise...he's really good here.  Jason Statham makes the most of his part, using every bit of his developing iconic presence. His look goes a long way.Edward Norton adds another intelligent characterization to his resume. It's a one-dimensional role (hell, they all are but who really cares here...) but the details and quirks make all the difference in the world.All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable film!
