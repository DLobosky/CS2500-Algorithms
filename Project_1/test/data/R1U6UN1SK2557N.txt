It is full of interesting historical context of the composers and their works and fascinating performer trivia, making it quite entertaining and educational in addition to comparing the many recording choices.  Compared to Penguin or Gramophone, it gives MUCH MORE in-depth backgroung on each work's history and significance.  Also, there is a lack of any "British bias" (since published in USA) that some cite with Gramophone or Penguin (both UK published).  Case in point: American pianist, Garrick Ohlsson's superb eight volumes of Chopin on the Arabesque label.  Third Ear is the only guide to extensively review each of Ohlsson's Arabesque CD's while there is not one mention in the 2003 Penguin or Gramophone.  Bias?  Perhaps more likely the Brits are just not familiar with all the musicians "across the pond."  Its really impossible for any one guide to be the "end-all" guide.A notable and unique feature of The Third Ear Guide is the many pages of great biographies of the FAMOUS MUSICIANS by instrument in the back (pianists, violinists, violists, cellists, wind players, percussionists, vocalists etc).  So, here you can find legends from Rubinstein, Horowitz, Pires, Perahia, Grumiaux, Oistrakh, Casels, Starker, Bain, Holliger, Graham, Pavoratti and many other admired musicians/vocalists thoughout the past century.  In addition to some curious history and career milestones of these well-loved performers, The Third Ear Guide also cites some of their better recordings - a real valuable feature I found.  However, this guide waxes hot and cold depending on the composer/genre.  For example, in the listings of available performances for a huge category like Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, there are SEVERAL entire pages covering nearly two dozen musicians who have recorded those works with compelling insights into their styles, historic performances and careers.  Really great stuff for the conoisseur!  But, in other categories it is a different story.  Most frustrating to some is that in many cases, obvious top recordings and major performers are not mentioned, leaving the reader with an incomplete information.  But, the bottom line is that no one guide is the end-all resource, and serious collectors will have this guide along with the Gramophone and Penguin Guides as each really has something valuable and often unique to contribute to the study of the finest recordings.On the style side, the commentary is not dry and academic but full of human interest and spicy opinions - revealing "nuggets" of fascinating information for the music you most love.  Additionally, the editors are not always prim-and-proper, saying only positive things (like Penguin Guide) but actually give critical and insightful comments which truly helps one sort out the pack.  In this respect, the Third Ear Guide is the probably the most interesting to read compared to the others.  So, this guide is much more than just a guide to look up ratings - it is a fascinating journey into classical music, its vast repertoire and its performers.  If you are a serious collector, multiple guides area always the best way to go to get a wide variety of opinion.  If you really can only pick one guide, most people would go with legendary Penguin Guide.  But, my second guide would definately be Third Ear (over Gramophone) as it often lists recordings suprisingly not listed in Penguin.  Also, it is just plain fun and fascinating to read at random.
