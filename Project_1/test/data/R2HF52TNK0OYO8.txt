I would say ansd write that everyone read the BOOK The Late Great Palate Earth, and ignore jigsaw and other books like it. In the Late Great Palate Earth you will see that Hal Lindsey claims noting, but that he is studying Scripture; He makes NO claims of being a prophet, and makes NO prophecys in the BOOK.  What he does do is look at the Bible predictions for the last days and tries to see how they fit in with current events. He makes a compelling case that we are in the last days, read it for yourselves. The Book Was written in the 1960s and hear he warned us about the Islamic Explosion in it. He shows how the Prophecies of Israel's return, from all over the world, to there land (1948), is a key sign to the end times; He also shows how they would come back into Israel first, and get Jerusalem back at a later time (1967). Hal shows how the Bible predicts how there will be four major spears of influence in the world in the end times; Including a united Europe (Europe is uniting and its Happening in front of our own eyes); an Arab and Muslims confederation (Iran, Jordan, Libya, etc.,) with the same goal of defeating Israel; The Russians and her allies in the North (Most of the -stain countries, all part or all Muslim country's) and an Asian Power base (China, India). All of this is lining up right in front of our own eyes, are you going believe your own eyes or mockers like Samuele Bacchiocchi; Read if for yourselves and make up your own mind. Just remember As the Apostle Peter wrote in 2 Peter Chapter 3 remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.  First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own passions and saying, &quot;Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot; case closed.
