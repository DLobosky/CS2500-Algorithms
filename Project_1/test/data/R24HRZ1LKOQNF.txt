The songs themselves are slow paced and melodic (so if you like upbeat songs, this cd is not for you). This album is more classical, slow and sweeping. And if I were rating this album on voice quality alone I would have given it *5* stars. However I am rating the songs themselves as well, and not all of them captured me. But there are 7 out of the 12 songs that I would give a straight *5* stars to. My ratings are as follows:Wild Horses 4/5 starsI Dreamed a Dream 5/5 starsCry Me a River 5/5 starsHow Great Thou Art 5/5 starsYou'll See 5/5 StarsDaydream Believer 3/5 starsUp to the Mountain 3/5 starsAmazin Grace 5/5 starsWho I was born to be 5/5 starsProud 3.5/5 starsThe End of the World 4/5 starssilent Night 5/5 starsSo it rounds to a 4 star ratingAll in all this is definitely better than 90% of the albums out there. And it has become a treasured part of my keeper shelf... beautiful voice and beautiful songs!
