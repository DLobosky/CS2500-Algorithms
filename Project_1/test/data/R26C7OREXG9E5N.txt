Although I've been collecting knives for a few years and carrying a pocket knife for more than 50, this is my first Spyderco.I originally posted this review in September 2011 but, after more than two months, much of what I felt about the Tenacious has changed and I've made some extensive edits.What hasn't changed is my being bothered by the fact that this model is made in China. I'm not a fanatic about buying only products made in the U.S., but tend to stay away from much of what is made in China. Anyway, nobody put a gun to my head to buy this knife and I have to admit that the quality is quite good for the price. Spyderco seems to be doing a first class job of overseeing their Chinese source, which is more than I can say for some other brands.One thing that did change was my concern about the "hole". The Tenacious is the only knife that I own that uses this opening method. It took me a little while, but I've become very comfortable with it. I may be the only person who doesn't use his thumb to open the knife. I find it easier and faster to use my index finger to "flip" the blade open. A classic case of doing what works. I did loosen the pivot bolt about ½ turn and now the blade just flies open with a flick of my finger. No problem with accidental opening whatsoever and closing is a one-hand operation as well.The blade steel is 8Cr13Mov which I've come to feel is of mid-level quality. It takes a nice edge but doesn't hold it nearly as long as something like ZDP189. Given the price point, I have no complaints.The G10 scales are grippy and I like the pocket clip. I wish that more manufacturers would design knives that allow for four-way clip positioning, but not many knives are designed to handle that.At some 4 ounces, this knife feels heavier than it looks and you really know that it's in your pocket. The blade is quite thick and the serrations are extremely sharp. Oddly, I didn't find the plain portion of the edge to be as sharp as expected from Spyderco. Although I wasn't sure that I would like the combo blade, it turns out that I do. Cutting heavy rope and plastic ties is a breeze with the serrated portion. Made in China or not, the knife exudes quality. Even the packaging was better than expected. I initially had some doubts about keeping the Tenacious. However, after 2+ months of use, there is no way that I'm going to sell it.It's now nearing the end of December and I'm making one more edit....I like this knife so much that I'm giving one as a Christmas gift.Call me crazy, but I've been working on polishing the blade on mine to a mirror-like finish with 3M micron paper. It's a long process to do by hand but I've been doing it a little at a time. Probably silly to waste time on this with a $30 knife that will actually be used, but it looks quite a bit different from the stock finish.
