One wonders how such an astounding trainwreck could seemingly be so earnestly intended.  It is impossible to do justice to how exceedingly, wretchedly cheesy this is.  Others have hit the high (actually low) points, but I don't think there's any way to fully capture the essence of this disc.  Kitschy, loungey, retro, irretrievably dated, utterly stunning...  At times sidesplittingly funny, at other points unbearably wretched.  Like a trainwreck you just can't turn away, though you know you should.
