The children in the videos range from preschool to early elementary, and that is really the age range these are targeted to. The workouts are a bit long, my kids rarely do an entire DVD in one showing, but that is OK with me. Frankly, they love watching these as much as doing them, so I do use them in the car too for long drives. They find these videos entertaining because the instructor is very silly, and encourages the kids in the video to be that way too.Per some of the complaints, it's true that many of the poses are not orthodox yoga asanas, and that the workouts do not flow in the way that a good adult class would. I think that is fine, and actually a plus, because these are specifically designed for the attention spans and bodies of young children. So if you are looking for a DVD to do alongside your child, these probably aren't it. But if you just want something entertaining that will whet their whistle for yoga, you can't beat these.
