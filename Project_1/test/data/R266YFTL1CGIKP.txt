In fact, I like it so much I was just on here trying to find the various components of it so that I can have back ups. If I can't find them...well, let's just say you don't want to meet up with me over the last one of these at the department store. Tug of war will ensue.All kidding aside, I do use bareMinerals / Bare Escentuals products daily and I do really like them. My bio: Over 40, still getting occasional blemishes and fine lines and on top of that, using Obagi for aging and sun damage correction. Not a good combo for choosing any make-up to be sure. But bM/BE really did fit the bill and I've never looked back.This kit was my first color kit. Because even my eyelids are sensitive now I needed to go ahead and switch to Minerals for eye color. Because I'm a military officer, I wasn't looking for glam or even anything really noticeable, but rather a way to cover the irritation and look presentable and professional. This kit is designed to be exactly that; subtle, natural and easy.First off, there are no brushes in this kit. I used a brush from the starter kit for the blush and the small one for eye-shadow and the fantastically awesome magnetic liner brush from another kit. So, yes, you will need to either pony up a substantial amount for brushes, buy a kit for the brushes or use your own. Mineral make-up doesn't work as well with some of the standard brushes out there so your results may vary if you try to use those.Chic Nude Eye-color: Awesome! It is a sort of barely there color when just a light dusting is applied. That will completely even out the skin color yet provide enough of a differentiation so that you don't have that strange uni-color look after foundation is on. A little more and it has just the slightest hint of shimmer and paleness that makes the eye appear wider and more awake.Smokey Sage Eye-color: I use this as just the accent, exactly as shown in the diagram in the kit. It is a perfect color for lighter colored eyes. They make the blue in mine really appear much bluer. I use this so little that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to use up that small jar ever.Spiced Fig Eyeliner: This is my favorite liner hands down. I have 4 other colors and this one is the best. I would like one giant tub to go please. Seriously, it is a brown but with just the slightest hint of green. By slight I mean only when you're trying to figure out why this liner looks so fab and smooshing around particles of it on a white piece of paper to do so will you finally realize there is a touch of green. It is so very easy to put on with the angled eyeliner brush and it does stay put, which is a first for me. But yet it comes off really easy with just a swipe of remover or when washing my face.Desert Rose Blush: I really do like this as my standard day time blush. It does what we expect a daytime blush to do without looking obvious about it. Use very sparingly.Sandy Buxom Lip Gloss: If brushes are the rock stars of the other kits, this is the rock star introduction of these kits (aside from Fig eyeliner, that is). I hadn't tried any of the Buxom lip products yet since I saw the word Gloss and took my 40+ year old self the other direction. But, alas, I was wrong. It is refreshing and  cool on the lips (tastes like mint), is very moisturizing and the pale color means it blends nicely and maintains a professional look. I love the stuff.Even the box is cute and useful. Each item fits into its little slot and the box is small and closes magnetically. That means I just toss the box into my gym bag and I have my entire color kit organized and ready to go. (And no, I don't work for them. I wish I did...I'd get a discount! I'm just a customer.)
