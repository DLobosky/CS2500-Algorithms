First of all, this is my favorite movie of all time. I first saw this film when I was about 4, and I would watch it over and over. The only thing I didn't understand was how the mortal time froze but Jack and Lily didn't. Then when I was older I understood it, because they were touching the unicorn. But this movie is a classic. It's my brother's favorite film too. I think they could make one hell of a sequel, but it's better they don't try! They might really kill it, so they better leave it as the only but greatest legend ever told! My brother agrees! But if Ridley Scott wants to make a new Legend, he had better call me first for some ideas. I was thinking tey could bring Darkness back who can try to raise more dark and hell, meanwhile Tom,I mean Jack is married to Lily with a son and they must save the world of mortals and fantasy all over again! But it could never beat the first, unless maybe i wrote the movie and script! I reccomend this movie to anyone over the age of 7, this is the greatest movie and Legend ever told, Greatest movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!
