A seed becomes a seedling and then grows into a plant when it is in the soil.  A plant is made up of many things, including roots, stems, leaves and flower buds.  Trees and other types of plants "need water, sunlight, and space to grow."  The stems help them to get the food that they need to grow and survive.  They grow above ground where you can see them and they "connect to roots below the soil."  If you have ever used a straw to drink your milk or juice you will know how a straw acts.  For example, "They carry water to leaves and flowers."  A straw brings your milk or juice up into your mouth.  If a flower did not have a stem it would not be able to stand up.  Stems also help plants to "get sunlight and air."  It might surprise you to know that a tree trunk is also a stem.  Trees have bark to protect them.  In this book you will also read about stems that people and animals can eat, you'll see many pictures of stems, and will be able to take a look at four stems that we often eat.  This is an introductory plant science book for the young student that explores stems.  The print in this book is large and there is typically one or two short sentences on each page accompanied by one large, pertinent photograph.  There is a clear, concise diagram that shows the parts of a plant.  If there is an advanced word such as "connect" it is printed in dark, bold letters and defined in the glossary.  In the back of the book is an index, a pictorial glossary, and a section about stem facts.  This is one book in the plant science series, Let's Look at Plants (First Step Nonfiction), an excellent beginning series you may wish to consider adding to your library or classroom shelves.This book courtesy of the publisher.
