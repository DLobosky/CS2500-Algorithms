These two keep up a nice pace and this match will not bore you. Rey Had some nice dives over the top rope and it was back and forth action. Good idea to put two faces to start off but more of the crowd was behind eddie. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.2. Money in the bank ladder match Y2J vs. Kane vs. Chris Beniot vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Edge- What a way to back up a good match. Lots of sweet moves in this match. I would have to say shelton took the most risks in this match. There was a t-bone suplex off the top of the ladder. I think shelton should have won but i was fine with edge. Awsome match. Winner edge. Match Rating 10/10.3. Undertaker vs. Randy Orton- This was another awsome match. For there first time together in a ring they did awsome. The begining started out slow but the pace really picked up and false finishes were everywere. Also orton as an awsome counter out of the chokeslam. I alomost thought orton was going to win. Winner undertaker. Match Rating 10/10.4. Trish vs. Christy for the womans title- This was your avarege womens match. I did not think that christy should have been in a womens title match at her first wrestlemania. I thought they should have put victoria in or someone else. She did okay. Winner and still wwe womans champ trish Stratus. Match Rating 5/10.5. Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michales- All i can say is wow. These guys put on an awsome preformance. This did not make me leave my seat during the match. A nice shot of angle angleslaming michales back into the ring post. I was surprised the crowd was about 60 percent michales and 40 percent angle. Which made the match even better with the awsome crowd support. This is the best match on the card by far and one of the top 3 matches of 2005. About a 32 minute match with non stop action. Winner Kurt angle. Match Rating 10/10.6. Big Show vs. Akebono in a sumo wrestling match- Tis match was awful. I can see how some people might have enjoyed it because it might have been funny but i think it was a waste of time. They proboly wasted 15 minutes on nothing. I would have put booker t in there or someone else that has alot of talent. Awful match. Winner Akebono. Match Rating 2/10.7. John Cena vs. JBL for the wwe title-I was really looking foward to this match but at the end of it it was not that good. I have a few problems with this match. Number 1 is this is smackdowns main event at wrestlemania and the match only lasyed about 11 minutes. Another problem that i had with it was that jbl controlled the whole match untill cena hit an fu for the win. If u are a champion like jbl was for nine months i would have liked a better match than this. Good to see cena win. Winner John cena. Match rating 6/10.8. Batista vs. HHH for the world heavywight title- I had to watch this match a few times to like it more and more. The first thing that i really enjoyed was HHH entrence it was awsome. This was a good 20 minute match with blood and other good things. The one thing i would have liked to see are more false finishes. We did not to see HHH finishing move and i wish he would have kicked out of the pedigree. Good match anyway. Winner and new world heavywieght champ batistia. Match Rating 8/10.Well thats all. Wrestlemania gets a grade of 59/80 which is a 73%. I think that it is a fare grade that means this an awsome ppv and i hope that you would buy it. The first 5 matches were perfect and the last was good. I would sckip big shows match and watch cenas but you wont be that impressed. Overall awsome and please tell me if you thought my review was good or not by clicking yes or no below.
