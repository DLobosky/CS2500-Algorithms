It's a shame there aren't any sound bites so you can hear for yourself how good this album really is! On this 1991 c.d. Anne Murray has some great songs! Although none of the songs made the pop chart, and only one landed on the country chart ("Everyday" 1991) some of her best is here. I've had this c.d. for years & love it, my farorites are, "Overboard" > "Even the nights are better" > "Some days it rains all night long" > "Wrong end of the rainbow", (which was also on her prior 1990 c.d. "You will")  AND one of her best EVER is  "OH YES I DO", -- You'll need the repeat button for sure on that one!
