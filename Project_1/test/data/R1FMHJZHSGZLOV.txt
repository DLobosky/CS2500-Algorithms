The book's two major ingredients are a [1] timeline of events...and [2] pictures [or photographs]...[This] compilation...will guide anyone eager to find his or her own way into history.  It is an invaluable resource for students in introductory history courses in grade school, high school, or college."The above is found at the beginning of this spellbinding, informative, big (each page is 9.5 inches by 12.5 inches), and heavy (over five pounds!) book.  The timeline of events were compiled by the editors of "Encyclopaedia Britannica" (a leader in reference, education, and learning for more than two centuries) and the photographs (black & white and color) come from the "Getty Images" collection (the largest image archive if its kind in the world).This book's contents spans three centuries:(1) nineteenth (1850 to 1899)(2) twentieth (1900 to 1999)(3) twenty-first (2000 to 2007)Thus the total time period covered is 158 years.  This book's table of contents divides the book into 16 decades.  The first decade is (1850 to 1859) while the last "decade" is (2000 to 2007).(Not included in the table of contents is the fact that this book has an index as well as a "photo credits" section.)To orientate yourself to this book, be sure to read the "how to use this book" section first.  For some unknown reason, this important page is also not included in the table of contents.Each year or transition year (example: 1850 - 1851) has a double-page LAYOUT devoted to it.  Along the top and bottom of each layout is a TIMELINE (highlighted on a yellow background) that briefly describes important EVENTS for that particular year.  The events deal with the following SUBJECT CATEGORIES:(I) science, medicine, and technology(II) business and commerce(III*) history and politics (IV) the arts (V) daily life and society (VI) religion, philosophy, and education.Between the top and bottom timelines are numerous captioned PHOTOGRAPHS (each photo being KEYED to an event on one of the timelines).Some of the layouts have a MINI-ESSAY (included with the photographs and highlighted on a blue background) that expands on one of the timeline events.For example, for the year 1850, the double-page layout has the following:(1) Top timeline events: 12  (4 in subject category III*)    (2) Bottom timeline events: 12 (7 in subject category III*)(3) Captioned photos: 10 (4 are keyed to four events on the top timeline)(4) Mini-essay : Yes (it expands the tenth event on the top timeline)Finally, for those that want to see even more images, there is also a CD (included in an envelope secured on the inside of the book's front cover) that has nearly 20 thousand images.  Direct Internet access to Getty images provides links to an additional 2 million photographs, and a link to Encyclopaedia Britannica allows access to millions of additional historical facts.In conclusion, I can't say enough about this extraordinary book and its extras except to explain that it allows the reader to experience "an epic visual journey through more than a century [and a half] of world history!!!"(first published 2008;  how to use this book;  16 sections;  main narrative 535 pages;  index;  photo credits)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX
