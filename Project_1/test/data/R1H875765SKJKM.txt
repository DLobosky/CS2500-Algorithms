I can almost see through it if held against a bright light.Also, the fabric is kind of rough - certainly not as soft as many other brands of t-shirts I've bought.On the plus side, the size and fit is good.If this was a truly heavy cotton t-shirt, I'd be happy with the price.  But, these t-shirts are way overpriced for the quality.  If you wanted a thin t-shirt, these might be a decent buy for around $5.  However, mine was $10.55.My next attempt is the Fruit of the Loom 5.4 oz. Heavy Cotton T-Shirt.
