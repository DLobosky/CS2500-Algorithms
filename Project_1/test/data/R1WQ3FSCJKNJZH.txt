The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.I have the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring from the early 1990's and thought it was time to upgrade with this Valencia Cycle. There has been enough said about the video aspect of these performances and the singers, but few details about the audio except that it is excellent. I beg to differ. I have listened to all 4 performances once and the Rheingold now twice for this review with the DTS HD-MA track.The orchestra is recorded fine. The sound stage goes about 2-3 feet beyond the front corner speakers to the left and right. EDIT: After listening to it again, the orchestra is also reversed in the surround mode. If you listen to the stereo track 2:55 into the recording, the french horns are on the left, where they are actually sitting. When you then listen to it in the surround mode, they come from the right, i.e reversed. END OF EDIT.The voices is another story.First, the left and right front stage microphones have been reversed. You can hear this clearly at about 18:15 into the performance. First sings the Rhine maiden in the middle and her voice comes from the center. Then sings the left maiden, but the sound comes from the right. Then sings the right maiden and the voice comes from the left. Never had anything like that.Most recordings try to have the voices go along with the singers, i.e. when a singer goes across the stage, the voice also goes across the stage. A few send the voices mostly through the center like Villazon/Machaidze's  Romeo and Juliet. Here the video direction centers the singers and it appears natural.In this Rheingold, the voices come mainly from about 2 feet to the left of the center with some strange anomalies.At 30:49 Wotan is left of Fricka, but Fricka's voice is left of Wotan.At 38:06 Fricka is on the far right of the stage, voice is from left.Whenever the action is on the right, the voices come from the left with few exceptions. But when the action is on the left, the voices come mostly from the left, too. But at 2:08:13 Fasold is on the left, his voice is in the middle.At 2:14:46 Fasold moved to the right, his voice is now left.At 2:17:15 Erda appears on the far left of the stage, but the sound comes from the right.At 2:21:05 Wotan to the right of Erda, his voice is left of her voice.The reversal of the stage microphones explains most of the anomalies, but not everything. Why not more sound from the right, when they are left.?Philipp Knop could probably tell us what went wrong. He is given credit for the stereo and surround mix.With the performance so much utilizing the projections in the background and wide stage shots required for that to work, the misallocation of the voices just ruins this for me. To see Wotan on the right and to hear him from the left is just goofy. If you watch it on a 32" screen and your loudspeakers are 36" apart, you probably won't notice. In my setting, very noticeable.The other 3 parts of the Cycle are essentially the same. EDIT: They are not the same and I'll review them separately. END OF EDIT.
