OK, first I want to talk to the genious who put the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone. You have to remove your headset to put the phone in the charger. Are you kidding me? At more that 3X the price of other brands, I expected a high quality phone but got this piece of junk instead. The description leads you to believe the case is ruggedized with rubber. Not so, there's a thin band of rubber on the edges only - other than that it's plastic everwhere. It also claims to be water and dust resitant. How is that possible with a cheap plastic back cover with a 1" hole and no gasket? The voice quality is tinny when using the phone's speaker. There is a annoying delay when pressing buttons and the phone keeps ringing when you pick up an extension for a few seconds. And worst of all, it uses a proprietary battery. If you must have a Siemens phone get the S series that uses rechargeable AA batteries.
