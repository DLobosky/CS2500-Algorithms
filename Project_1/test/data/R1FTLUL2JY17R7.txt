This is an excellent volume for teaching quality literarycriticism to collegiate-level students. In primary andsecondary school, the emphasis is on sentence construct.i.e. A good sentence must have a subject, verb and object.Although students may learn the mechanics of writing,they do not pick up fine nuances in literary expression.This work forces the student to develop a basic idea or theme.Once developed the point of view must be defended persuasively.The thesis of the work is contained somewhere in the firstparagraph.  Sentences should be simple and stated actively.Finally, each work should be developed in successive draftsfrom the first to the final draft. I've found that studentshave a problem differentiating literary criticism from asimple regurgitation of what they read. The Practical Stylisthelps to focus each student's attention on enunciatingcriticism of a person nature or within the experientialdomain of a first hand knowledge. It's painful to learn todevelop quality literary criticism because the primary andsecondary education simply does not focus on this aspectin any meaningful depth.
