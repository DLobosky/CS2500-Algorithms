Her longer books go in depth into Feng Shui typically providing both a lot of illustration examples and well-structured books.Her "Little Book of Feng Shui for...." series are a marvelous addition to her longer more in depth books. These little books really are small, fitting into the palm of your hand, measuring about 2 inches by 3 inches. They fit into a purse or briefcase. However, she still manages to provide 118 simple clear Feng Shui tips for what you want in your home and what to avoid while there. Each tip receives 1 mini page devoted to it (a few are 1.5-2 pages), and some are accompanied by a b&w photo illustration. The 118 Feng Shui for Home tips include room orientations which bring "luck" for you, a room layout, good fortune symbols (Asian ones, yes, some of which, of course, you can shift a little to make more uniquely you and Western), auspicious colors.  I particularly like the cleansing rituals (there are a few, each with a difference purpose) she provides.  Indeed, after negatives events or people in your home, it is important to clean and clear completely.  Doing so on an energetic or spiritual level in conjunction with physical cleaning serves to deepen the affect of the cleanses.In addition to the rituals, positions, and shapes, Ms. Too suggests specific tips about incorporating good luck and energy Feng Shui sound elements.  I am, of course, refraining from citing any specifics out of respect for her intellectual property contained in the book.  Some of the tips, you will definitely want to practice at home.  However, with the size of the book, it is easy to pop it into your pocket or purse when you are going shopping at Ikea for furniture, curtains, pillows, and house items to incorporate better Feng Shui for your home.
