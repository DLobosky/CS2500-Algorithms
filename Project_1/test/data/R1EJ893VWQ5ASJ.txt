My previous DECT 6 phone broke recently and I picked this one because I don't need answering machine.This is 2010 model from Panasonic without the answering machine. If you are looking for answering machine, explore KX-TG4031B which is similar to this one with answering machine.Cons:- It takes 3 to 4 seconds to open the phone book, i just have 15 contacts stored (half star rating less for this).- No Talking Caller ID on this model as advertised in the item description (half star rating less for this).- Can save only 50 numbers in the phone book.- Speaker phone exists only in the handset not in the base. I think this is same for most basic phones in the market.Pros:- Can conference 2 outgoing calls like we do in cell phone.- Great call quality both using handset and speaker phone, but i have not noticed the call quality difference between DECT 6 and DECT 6 PLUS technology.- Excellent range and changes to ECO mode when the handset is closer to the base during the call to increase talk time.- Great battery life. After the full battery charge, I used this phone continuously for 2 hours and I still see 2 bars out of 3 in the battery indicator.- Light weight handset. The handset uses 2 rechargeable AAA batteries which is easy to get.- Large buttons in the number pad. The screen is clear and you can see the caller ids clearly.- I am using one handset but this system can be Expandable up to 6 handsets.
