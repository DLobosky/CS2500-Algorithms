I purchased 2 Brother LC61BK (black) ink cartridges from Vivamart which I believed to be STANDARD yield cartridges, instead they shipped me STARTER CARTRIDGES!!  I spoke with a representative from Brother to confirm yield stats on the cartridges and he said that the STANDARD ink cartridge has a 450 page per cartridge yield.  He said that a STARTER cartridge is only HALF-FULL and therefore, has half the life (or less) of a STANDARD cartridge.  If you read the Technical Details section for this item you will see that Vivamart posted their product under the item description for a STANDARD YIELD CARTRIDGE (450 pages) - and yet never fully disclosed that the item they were selling was not as advertised and that it only had a 200 page yield per cartridge, maybe.Another thing, I have no idea if these cartridges are expired or not, as there was no expiration date stamped anywhere on the item.  Also, they didn't come in a box, and that is typically where you will find the expiration date.
