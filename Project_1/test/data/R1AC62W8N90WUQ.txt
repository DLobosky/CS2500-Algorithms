The sapphire color is bright and very pretty.  The cover is nice and solid, but I'm still able to fold the cover back if I want.  The only thing I would like is some way to hold the cover closed.  I usually put the reader face down (with the cover side holding the reader on the top) to keep the lid from popping up.  Plus, when it is in my purse and I don't get it with the edge face up, it easily opens or something gets caught inside the cover.   I'm thinking of adding a ribbon around the edge to hold it closed.  If you look at M-Edge Trip Jacket for Sony Reader Touch Edition, Green w/Tan, it is canvas, but has a tie around it to keep it closed, which would make the perfect.  Overall, I really like this cover.  It does its job.  Plus, it matches the color of my car. :)
