After doing an ApHogee protein treatment my hair was left in worse condition than before I did the apHogee regimen, it is now dryer and more brittle. I ordered the Emergencia Deep Intensive Treatment by Toque Magico and this Nacidit treatment and thought to use them both to compare by dividing my hair in half.  Both treatments left my hair silky, tangle-free and soft.  Most definitely, I will order again.Future update to follow...
