This book shows the background of the attempts by John Law to create a better monetary base for France.  The ideas he pursued were doomed by political interventions, and France was left worse off than before.  The surrounding scandal rocked the Continent.  The book also provides many insights into how political influence on national economics can be developed and exercised.  The book is enlivened by many interesting details of John Law's life.  How did a Scotsman with a mixed reputation come to be the prime mover in French economics?  That would never happen today. You will be fascinated by this tale of how difficulties make for strange political accommodations.Based on this biography of John Law, the real character of the man remains somewhat murky. While this book tells us a lot about the effects he created on the lives of others, what other people had to say about him, and what his environment was like, we get a limited sense of the man himself. Little is recorded of his writing or conversations in this book. In this sense, he reminds me a little of Howard Hughes. What is most clear is that John Law made both his successes and his failures through his persuasiveness (he sought the ear of powerful people, not the other way around) and his personality faults (he was clearly reckless in many ways -- killing a man in a duel, pushing the implementation of his financial schemes too aggressively, and being overly friendly with married ladies). The book glosses over what John Law did that was deliberately harmful in some cases (sending people by force to Louisiana after it was known that a high percentage of the people arriving there died of disease, publishing glowing reports based on no shred of reality about Louisiana to encourage investments, and going along with printing vastly too much paper currency knowing that this would backfire).For a man who came from a Scottish family of clerics, he was amazingly immoral. The ideas he advanced about paper money were pretty simply based on the earlier successful development of such bank-based currency in England. The Mississippi Company scheme was not too much different from an earlier one that had almost bankrupted Scotland involving Panama.  Like many innovators, he was taking experience from one country and simply transplanting into another one.  Although much is made in the book about him learning the laws of statistics so he could make the gaming odds run in his favor, he clearly took outlandish risks in other areas throughout his life. That is a fascinating insight into his character.I see the man through this book more as sinner than saint. Clearly, his concepts would have eventually been used in France without him. Perhaps pushed by a more responsible person, these concepts would have worked and France would have had better economic development in the 18th century. Clearly, he got his just deserts because he died penniless in terms of cash, and hounded by his enemies. Overcome your misconception that every pioneer is a great woman or man by learning about John Law. Sometimes, they were just one of the first. When the history of the early Internet age is written in a few years, who will be our John Law? Think about it! Your answer may save (or even make) you a fortune!Look for the character behind the new idea.
