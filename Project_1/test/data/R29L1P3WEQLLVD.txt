After that I picked my wife up a Kindle 2, I bought a Kindle DX, later I replaced my original Kindle with a kindle 3 and recently my wife replaced her Kindle with a Kindle 3 with ads.  In other words, I have owned or used 5 different Kindles before the Kindle Touch.Physically it is smaller than the Kindle 3 but a slight bit thicker.  The screen is recessed and looks almost like a matted photo.  The minimal approach gives the device a more sophisticated, "modern" look.  It is also easier to hold when reading. The screen is exactly the same size as that of the Kindle 3 and the e-ink seems to be the same, yet it seems much brighter and easier to read.  The e-ink jump from Kindle 2 to Kindle 3 was amazing so I was surprised at how much better the text appeared.  Looking closer, the deepest black and the lightest "white" is almost identical on both screens.  It seems the new Kindle takes advantage of the e-ink better than the older one or perhaps the resolution is slightly higher.  Of course the screen layout helps here - having a larger percent of the device covered by the screen makes it seem larger while the framed appearance keeps your attention on the screen.  As I noted in the review of the Kindle 3, the darker color surrounding the screen makes the lighter colors appear brighter - I would say having the almost black "mat" around the screen does much the same thing even though the main body of the new Kindle isn't any lighter than the old.How good is the e-ink?  I use reading glasses when I read paper books.  I do not use reading glasses when I read the Kindle - the text is easier on my eyes than text on paper and easier for me to read.Using the touch screen is very intuitive.  The only little problem I have is the option to "turn pages" by dragging - If you think of turning pages in a book it makes perfect sense but for a paperless device it seems almost counter-intuitive to drag back to go forward and forward to go back.  If there is an option to reverse this I haven't seen it.  I much prefer just tapping anyway. The touch options are very well done.  What I mean is that the typical Kindle menus work just as you would expect but with a very intuitive touch system.  The virtual keyboard actually works better than the little button keyboard on the Kindle 3 and is as easy as to use (i.e., less hitting wrong keys) as any virtual keyboard I've used and better than many.A couple of quick points about this version - The ads are very unobtrusive - I don't even really notice them unless there is a great graphic or photo on the screen saver.  You do not get ads while reading.  One of the great things about the Kindle is the free 3G and yet I chose not to get it on this one.  I have found that over 95% of the time I need to download something onto my Kindle I am already at a place that has wifi.  I also have a portable "mifi" that I can use anywhere covered by Verizon.  I doubt if I'll miss the 3GAlthough Amazon has created new services for the Kindle (i.e., the ability to share books with friends and check out books from libraries) they haven't created new applications for the actual device.  I am not complaining - as I said in a review I wrote for an older version of the Kindle, the Kindle is a one trick pony but it does this trick very well.  I have tried several devices and have never seen a device that reads as cleanly and as gentle on my eyes as the Kindle.  And the experience just gets better....
