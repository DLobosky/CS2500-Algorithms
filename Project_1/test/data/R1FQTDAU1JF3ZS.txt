The first time I saw this movie I thought it was very exciting and very good, but I didn't think it was great.  Then I read numerous professional reviews, including one by noted sci-fi author Orson Scott Card, calling "Serenity" the "best sci-fi movie ever made".  I was skeptical.  Certainly it was better than all of the Star Wars prequels, but that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger.  So I went to see it two more times.  Then it clicked.  This movie is so full of subtleties and significant small details that make it so much more complex than the usual blunt-force sci-fi movie of recent years (or any years, for that matter).  If it's not the absolute best sci-fi movie ever, it's certainly right up there with the best.  The key to understanding that is to watch it several times.  That, of course, makes it an ideal dvd purchase.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but grow to appreciate it more and more every time you see it.
