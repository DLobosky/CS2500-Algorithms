Save yourself a few bucks and buy the 2 disc version from the U.K.The picture  quality is relatively good and the movie is all there.I own a Phillips dvp642 dvd player and it plays everything that I throw at it. How this cheap little player $89.00 at wal Martis able to convert a pal dvd to be able to play on an ntsc tv I don't know,but it does.It also will play region 2 disc without a problem.I have ordered many region 2/PAL discs from Amazon U.K because they are not available in Canada or the U.s.and they have allplayed perfectly.
