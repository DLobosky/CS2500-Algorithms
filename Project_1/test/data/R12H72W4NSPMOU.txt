This appears to be a redacted copy of Florence Sakade's books Origami, Japanese Paper Folding Books One and Two," first published in the 1950s and still a great beginning book.  It would appear that new ideas--like the clowns on the back cover--have been added, but it still essentially the same easy to follow guide to simple origami.  Most of the designs are for flat models, but there are a number of 3 dimensionals as well, the crane being, of course, the most ancient and traditional of all of them.
