I was intrigued by the previews for this film, but was afraid it would be similar to the whole "Eyes Wide Shut" debacle - a pseudo-psychological "thriller" that didn't thrill in the slightest. Thankfully, I was rather surprised - this is a very entertaining film with unpredictable twists and turns, some of which are in the style of "Jacob's Ladder." I was kept guessing until the big reveal, and The Truth was a total shock to me; I truly hadn't expected that kind of element to this film - I really can't say what sort of element I'm talking about, as that would absolutely ruin some of the surprise. The story revolves around David Aames (Tom Cruise,) a charismatic, rich, and witty executive living a charmed life, but only skimming over the surface. He quite unexpectedly meets the woman of his dreams, and from there, things begin a completely unpredictable course of events that rapidly spiral out of his control - or do they? Is Cameron Diaz's character alive, or is he simply losing his mind? What's happening to Penelope Cruz? The plot is engaging, and I was wondering what would happen next. It's also a true aesthetic treat, with well-crafted scenes and beautiful colors. The direction is very good, the acting above par, and the storyline engaging.The special features are entertaining, giving behind-the-scenes glimpses with the cast and filmmakers, as well as some insight into how the film came to be. An enjoyable experience, start to finish, and I definitely recommend it.
