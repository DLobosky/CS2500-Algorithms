This is great family comedy! I remember watching this when my children were small.... and I didn't realize how much I had missed it until I bought the seasons (after looking all over town for them) and we all sat down and started watching them. My kids absolutely love the show too! Most of all they can't believe it was published by Disney, they had never heard of it!
