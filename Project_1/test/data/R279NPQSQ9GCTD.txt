Once that thing got revving, the only way to slow it down was to flick the on-off button. I wore out two of those buttons on the P-C. A single speed is just not adequate for light touch-ups.With variable speed, you can slow the Bosch way down just to do touch-ups without eating a hole in your wood. When you are really ready to eat wood, put it on high speed with some coarse grit, and for most applications you can say goodbye to your belt sander. I haven't used my belt sander since getting this beauty over 2 years ago. Why should I? This thing is very fast, easier to handle, and gives better results.If you are going to run it on high speed for extended time periods, put on some anti-vibration gloves. During one project (10 tables over 4 weeks) I ended up with a bad tingling sensation in my hands that didn't lay off for about 3 weeks. Then I bought some anti-vibration gloves. These help a lot.Some other positives: this sander REALLY holds the sandpaper. The hook-and-loop is so tight that I really wrestled pulling the paper off at first. With the P-C, I ended up replacing my hook-and-loop pad annually. In a couple of years, it would have made up the difference I should have paid in the first place for the Bosch. And the dust canister--quite an improvement over the paper bags that the previous version of this sander used (and I owned), which would tear after a while. They get more of the dust, and open up and clean rapidly. Be sure you snap them closed well after cleaning, as it is easy to think they are closed when they are not.One should not forget the difference that the larger sanding surface makes. While the sandpaper is more expensive, it is larger. It lasts a long, long time--partly due to its size, partly due to efficient dust removal.The extra support handle on the front of the unit makes the sander easy to handle and greatly reduces fatigue. And it can be removed when you want to get into tight spaces.I hope I finally learn this lesson--buy a quality tool the first time, and save time, money, and fatigue in the long run. The Bosch 3727DVS is top rate.
