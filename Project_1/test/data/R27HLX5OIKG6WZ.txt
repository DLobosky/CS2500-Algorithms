I had high hopes for it, having read the author's 1986 non-fiction book "Under The Cloud: The Decades of Nuclear Testing," which is still the definitive work on the subject. "Under the Cloud" documents in great detail the hundreds of nuclear explosions that the Atomic Energy Commission and the military services set off on U.S. soil, and the effects that the fallout from these tests had on "downwinders" (i.e., virtually the entire country). An important, powerful and thorough analysis, "Under the Cloud" helped raise public awareness of the lingering health issues caused by nuclear testing, and it remains a classic in the field.Because "Under the Cloud" was so good, my expectations for "The Atomic Express" were lofty. One is almost forced to compare it with Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." Both novels have similarly bizarre and insane characters. Both involve ordinary men and women struggling to function in the stifling, mind-numbing and demoralizing bureaucracy in which they are trapped. Both have passages of witty, memorable dialogue that will make you chuckle at the absurdity of it all. And both offer madcap, tragicomic indictments of the lengths to which people in power will go to protect themselves from ever looking bad. In the comparison, however, "The Atomic Express" comes in a distant second.I finally figured out why. In "Catch-22," the story took place against an exceptionally realistic background of a World War II medium bomber unit. The airfield, the B-25 aircraft, the crew briefings, the flight operations--all of the things with which the zany characters interacted were "true to life." In "The Atomic Express," however, the nature and characteristics of the nuclear weapons themselves--arguably the "stars" of the book--are not realistic. For example, here are two specific things that bothered me (without giving too much away). The "Cadillac" and "Mickey Mouse" bombs, I thought, were ridiculous. Normally, I can easily suspend my disbelief and enjoy the most far-out science fiction story, but in this novel those "bombs" were too far removed from any semblance of reality. Another thing that kept jarring me were some characters' frequent references to making a thermonuclear bomb by simply adding some lithium deuteride to an atomic bomb. It's not that simple. One of the most difficult challenges facing the designers of the first thermonuclear, or "hydrogen," bomb was to figure out how the explosion of the fission "primary" could be made to compress and ignite the lithium deuteride "secondary" before the bomb blew itself apart. The idea of just detonating an atomic bomb near "twelve hopper cars of lithium deuteride" to create an enormous thermonuclear explosion, as suggested in "The Atomic Express," is absurd. Yes, I know it's "fiction," but even in fiction it's important for an author to present accurate scientific facts, especially in such a technical field as nuclear physics. So, on balance, I give "The Atomic Express" three stars. By all means, read it if you are at all interested in or intrigued by the subject of nuclear testing. It is well-written, there are many really good passages, the characters are well-drawn, and the story is interesting enough to keep one engaged throughout. But it is just a little TOO far out into the realm of fantasy for me to give it a stronger endorsement.
