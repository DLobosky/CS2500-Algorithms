Charlie West know who he is but he just cant remember the final piece to figure out who the actually terrorist are and what their plan is. Will he rember in time or will it be too late. This book is very suspenseful and action packed. It reads quickly as there is a lot going on and the story keeps coming at you. I was very impressed with this book and the way it ended. It is a great series and a great story of standing up for what you believe in.I received a copy of this book from Booksneeze to give an unbiased opinion on.
