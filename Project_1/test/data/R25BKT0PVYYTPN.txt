My wife and I work together and have a long commute, and books on CD have become a enjoyable way to use the time.  However, this one drove us nuts.  It's hard to separate the author from the reader sometimes, so I find myself annoyed with both.  I found his voice to be very vanilla, very all-American.  On top of that, he seemed to have a lot of trouble with accents.  Voicing a latino that only sometimes had an accent, for instance, pulls me out of the story.  The husky voice of the antagonist and the CIA director got very, very tiring.As for the story, it feels like a first draft.  If I had to assign it one word, that word would be TEDIOUS.  The repetion was excruciating.  The dialogue feels like it was generated by an eighth-grader.  The plot is horribly predictable.  The narrative feels like a thin veil over heavy-handed pedantry.  (If you've read The Celestine Prophecy, you know what I mean.)  Rather than tell us a good story, it seems that Brown is trying to tell us that he did a lot of research.  My wife and I agree that the book comes off as one that somehow missed the editor's eyes.  Many contrived elements appear in the text, and the characters actually display wonder at the different unrealistic circumstances, as if Brown is saying to the reader, "I know, right?" when he is actually just being lazy.This book gets one star not because I can't give it zero, but because I did actually want to know what happened.  I think there is a kernel of a good book inside this one.  Probably several pages (CDs) shorter, and one that a good editor could have helped tease out.
