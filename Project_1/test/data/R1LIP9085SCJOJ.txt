&quot;All you need to destroy Objectivism once and for all is a reasonable argument against it.&quot;Very well. Here are a few at random (by no means an exhaustive list):1. In epistemology, Rand regarded herself as having solved the &quot;problem of universals&quot; when, in fact, she  never raised it. Universals, if they exist, are repeatable features of  reality; _whether_ they exist is an irreducibly ontological question, not  (as Rand thinks) an epistemological one. Rand fancied herself to have found  a Third Way between nominalism and realism (&quot;Objectivism&quot;) solely  because she identified &quot;universals&quot; with concepts (and  abstractions) in the opening paragraphs of ITOE.2. In ethics, Rand built  &quot;Objectivism&quot; on a foundation of pure _subjectivism_. Since her  ethic _presumes_ that one has made a positive &quot;choice to live,&quot;  Objectivism can give no guidance about whether to live or not, and all its  ethical injunctions rest on an arbitrary decision about which, strictly  speaking, Objectivism can give no guidance.Moreover, having dispensed  with any ultimate, objective ethical standard, Rand tried to introduce one  anyway by insisting that anyone who did _not_ put the Objectivist ethic  into practice was quite literally subhuman, even subanimal. She arrives at  this insane view by (very much against her own epistemological standards)  identifying &quot;human&quot; with just _one_ attribute of human beings:  namely, rationality (understood in her own highly inadequate way). To see  how this view works out in practice, read pp. 1054-55 of ATLAS SHRUGGED,  where Dagny Taggart quite unnecessarily shoots a guard who has  &quot;proven&quot; himself to be less than an animal.3. In politics,  Rand sapped all distinctive meaning from the moral concept of  &quot;rights&quot; by making respect for rights depend solely on  self-interest. That means that, in strict consistency, all Objectivism can  say about Hitler's atrocities is that it's a shame he loused up his _own_  life so badly.Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal  monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for  totalitarianism. The entire federalist system (including the Second  Amendment) is supposed to _prevent_ just such a monopoly.I could go on,  and sometimes I do ;-). But that will do for now.
