I picked this and DracuLarua up for my Boyfriend's daughter for her birthday after learning not only was she a huge fan but she didn't have any of the dolls yet.  I always look at them when I am at the store and ask my 5 year old if she wants them, but she says no.  I've just been dying to buy them for someone because I think they're so cool!  I wish they had goth dolls when I was a little girl!  This was the first one I bought for her because this is the one I always look at, she's MY favorite, I think she's the prettiest!  I love her blue plaid and her beautiful long hair.  She's just so pretty!  Her school girl outfit is so cute, too, I want one in my size, please!  I just love these dolls!  They all come with stands, too, so you can set them up as soon as they are removed from the box, which is what she did!  They are the prettiest lil goth dolls you ever did see, I recommend them to everyone!
