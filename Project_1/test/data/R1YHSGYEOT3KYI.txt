Please see my review of the Asics gel Kayano 17. The reason is I have about 10 pairs of running shoes from different companies and thus I can make an intelligent comparison. It's hard to review a shoe if you have nothing to compare it to. The extensive list of the running shoes I own is listed in that review. Got the Brooks Trance 10's on pre-order and as soon as they started shipping in early Jan. 2011 I got my shoes. This is the best running shoe Brooks has ever put out. I also have the new Beast as well. This shoe flip flops as my best all time shoe with the ASICS gel Kayano 17. It is a high technology shoe with the new DNA gel like absorb shock system. And it works great. I need a good cushioned support shoe. I have normal arch and usually buy the 2E width in 12.5 size. I took out the stock insoles as I do in all of my shoes (running and basketball). I have the heat molded insert by Sole (Dean Karnanze). Amazon does carry this item and its expensive-- about 50 bucks. It adds a considerable amount to the price of the shoe. Well worth the investment. Plantar Fasciitis is no joke and difficult to get rid of. The Brooks Trance 10 looks good is well cushioned without being mushy and the motion from heel strike to toe off is excellent with good energy return. The combination of the materials, the design the lacing with extra tongue loop and the overall performance of this shoe make it a winner and an excellent choice. I weigh in at 240 lbs and these shoes hold up well. I may give the Kayano a slight edge but very slight. I usually like a neutral shoe + but have found more cushion and stability with the shoes designed for mild to moderate over pronators even though I don't over pronate. The Brooks Glycerin 8 is also a great shoe but lacks some of the technical features of this shoe. The Brooks design team obviously did their homework and it shows with this shoe. Truly a crowning achievement they can be proud of and its made in the USA. Do not buy the Beast unless you have severe over pronation issues. I got them just because I wanted them and have relegated them to my cross training and walking shoe. The Trance 10 or the Kayano 17. Too close to call. Get them both and you'll see what I mean.
