So, a revision to the "You-can-be-anything-you-want-to-be" maxim might be more accurate:You cannot be anything you want to be--but you can be a lot more of who you already are.So that was when I switched gears and turned my attentionaway from an athletic career to other directions . . . yet thatsaid, my life would have been a lot easier for me had I been ableto assess my talents much earlier in my life.Rath now makes it possible via this update of his earlierbestseller, NOW DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS . . . it describesthe assessment tool that's available to purchasers of the book(via a unique access code to a website) that enables youto not only determine your talents, but to come up with ideasfor putting them into action.For example, I found myself personally relating to this description of a Developer:* You see the potential in others. Very often, in fact, potential is all you see. In your view no individual is fully formed. On the contrary, each individual is a work in progress, alive with possibilities. And you are drawn toward people for this very reason. When you interact with others, your goal is to help them experience success. You look for ways to challenge them. You devise interesting experiences that can stretch them and help them grow. And all the while  you are on the lookout for the signs of growth--a new behavior learned or modified, a slight improvement in a skill, a glimpse of excellence or of "flow" where previously there were only halting steps. For you these small increments - invisible to some - are clear signs of potential being realized. These signs of growth in others are your fuel. They bring you strength and satisfaction. Over time many will seek you out for help and encouragement because on some level they know that your helpfulness is both genuine and fulfilling to you.And I also liked what he had to say about working with an Achiever:* This person may well need less sleep and get up earlier than others. Look to him when these conditions are required on the job. Also, ask him questions such as "How late do you have to work to get this done? Or " When did you come home in this morning?" He will appreciate this kind of attention.STRENGTHS FINDER 2.0 is the perfect book for you to readif you're not sure if you are in the right job or career . . . inaddition, I'd strongly recommend it as a gift for any high schoolor college student you know who may be struggling with the questionof his or her choice of major.
