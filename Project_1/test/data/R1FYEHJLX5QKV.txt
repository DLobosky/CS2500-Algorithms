The author describes the world, the interaction of fairies, godmothers and humans, how magic works, what the rules are, how they make potions, etc.  It was boring.  There were a few stories, mostly being told, not shown.  Elena is the overworked and abused human who is taken on as an apprentice to become a fairy godmother.  She is given magic and learns how to use it.CAUTION SPOILERS:The main story begins on page 202, about what Elena does with three princes who are brothers on a quest to save a princess.  She turns one of them into a donkey to work as a donkey at her home.  He goes back and forth between donkey and human form during his penance.  Eventually he learns humility, compassion and the value of hard work.  Then they fall in love.  That story was interesting, but again too much telling, not enough showing.On the positive side, there were some interesting twists on fairy tales, some interesting characters and plot events.Two examples of telling, not showing follow.Page 175, "Elena learned all of the ways that duels could take place between Magicians - whether it was the Duel Direct where one threw powerful magical attacks at the foe, the Transformation Duel where each magician kept changing his form until one or the other was able to devour or otherwise incapacitate the opposition, or the Duel by Avatar where each magician transformed into a magical monster and magical comabat took place between the.  And she got as much practice in dueling as was possible under the circumstances---dueling took such huge stores of energy that no one really practiced it.  Instead, they did what she did; they studied the great combats of the past."  I am reminded of the Harry Potter dueling scenes where two enemies hurl spells at each other and we see what the spells do.  Ms. Lackey is "telling" about duels, whereas in H. Potter we are "shown" the duels which is so much more entertaining, partly because you can see the emotions the duelers are feeling.Page 365, Elena returns Ocatavian the lost prince to his father the king.  We see the conversation of "Father, I am home again.  There was a moment of stunned silence.  Then the King fell upon his son, weeping and embracing him, as the Royal Guard erupted into a cheer.  And after that -- well, that was when things got very interesting indeed."  The author then switches to Elena being home later that night recalling the events of the day as follows. "First there had been the whole Reconciliation scene to play out, then some of the explanation of what had happened to Octavian and why, then Elena had delivered herself of a bit of a lecture to King and Prince.  Not much of a lecture, but she had made it very clear that their first act must be to reconcile with Julian--- by delivering an apology --- It was the newly-humbled Octavian who'd had no difficulty with this rather obvious necessity, and in the euphoria of having his favorite son back, Henrick had agreed."  At first the author was "showing" us the reunion scene, then she switched to recalling the events (telling), but she never described "when things got very interesting indeed."  I was expecting something interesting, but didn't see it.Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: one.  Setting: undescribed location in a time with kings and knights on horseback.  Copyright: 2004.  Genre: paranormal fairy tale with a little romance.
