We used to give our dogs those rock hard rawhide treats that would keep them happy for long periods. After Piper broke several teeth, however, the doggy dentist advised not to give the girls any chews that couldn't be bent easily with our human hands. Since then we've been giving the girls softer chews, but kept looking for sticks that were a bit chewier.These Get Naked sticks seem to fit the bill. They are flexible enough to be safe for our dogs' teeth, yet chewy enough to last much longer than the soft sticks like the Newman sticks. Both dogs love the taste of these Get Naked sticks and look for them eagerly. Poor Piper takes much longer to devour her chew since she doesn't have all of her teeth. Gabby, on the other hand, finishes her Get Naked chew in five or ten minutes. The chew-challened Piper now gets half of one of these chews so she can finish it in a more reasonable time.I like the low calorie component of these treats and the wholesome ingredients and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to other dog owners.Sadly no potato ingredients are in these sticks.
