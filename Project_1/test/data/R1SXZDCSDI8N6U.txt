I am a tech geek and I do buy Dummies books because for some items, Wiley is the only publisher that will issues guides for items I am looking for. This book is an excellent example. iPhone for Dummies covers the original iPhone, NOT the 3G version. That said, it is still a great read. I bought this book because I was interested in an iPod Touch which is an iPhone without the phone. This is an easy to read, fun and informative book with lots of usage tips. There are wonderful, full color shots that show off the screen and features of the iPhone. Many of the gripes about missing features located at the end of the book, were added to the new 3G version. Grab the 3G version of this book when it comes out. This book will give you inside tips that aren't found in the manual. It is helpful for iPod Touch users as well. Quick start guides are one thing, but great tips make your device much easier to use. I have a co-worker who has an original iPhone and he was amazed that I knew more about his device than he did.
