I bought this product some days ago, and I made some tests on it, and it works fast, I copied a 1.1gb file in 1'51" (one minute and fifty one seconds)..The usb recognition was clean and fast..it's named as Datatraveler 2.0You can see a perfomance test picture I took, on the product images..The black color is excellent, very elegant..Just push the button to show up or to hide the usb connector..
