Seriously though...I just figured I'd review Serenity so I could get my five-star rating in, so I'll keep this short and sweet.  You will fall in love with this movie and Firefly, the series that spawned it.  Buy this movie, along with the Firefly series, on DVD. Joss himself has claimed that the chance of future projects depends almost entirely upon the sales of the Serenity Collector's Edition DVD.  That alone is enough reason to purchase it.In this movie, along with Firefly (the canceled series it is based on), character development comes first.  Flashy special effects always come later, which is what any storyteller should learn (&lt;cough cough> George Lucas prequels).  Anyway, I won't go on repeating what everyone else's reviews already say.  Watch both Firefly and Serenity and enjoy every single delightful moment.  Afterwards, you will be proud to call yourself a Browncoat.
