Anyway, I haven't had many problems; when I did have a BIOS issue, I called Customer Service & was able to solve the problem on the first try!!! It's lightweight, and the battery life is pretty decent for a 14" laptop (I can get around 5-5 1/2 hrs), but only if I'm NOT running a whole lot of power-consuming apps. I've had a few IE "not responding" issues, but that's Windows. Processor is awesome, graphics are standard, but the speakers are lousy. You most definitely have to hook up external speakers to have decent sound when playing your music.  Serious gamers should stay away - also those who use software/applications that would need ATI Radeon or NVIDIA Optimus graphics.  I haven't had any problems with the touchpad, though some people have. Haven't had a chance to wirelessly stream HD videos to my TV, because I don't have the adapter for that. Bluetooth comes in handy & I love using the MediaSmart option! Don't be afraid to purchase this computer - it's great for students and for those of you who don't need a desktop replacement PC!
