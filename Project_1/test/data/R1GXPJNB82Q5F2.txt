I admire the "Legend" of the Quick more than I enjoy the bulk of the music they created. I believe that Great Buildings were at their best when breaking new ground, and moving AWAY from the Quick influences. An example of "new ground" is the opening track....The song "Hold On To Something" is worth the price of this CD alone. An amazing adrenaline rush of powerpop energy. Truly one of the GREAT "lost" pop songs of the 80's. A masterpiece!Danny Wilde and Phil Solem went on to forge a long lasting partnership, which lead to chart success and a #1 hit single "I'll be there for you" (as the pop duo... The Rembrandts). So, when you hear the theme song to the tv series "Friends", just remember that these guys PAID THEIR DUES.Long overdue CD release, and a must own for powerpop collectors.JM
