While I appreciate every effort, much is excruciatingly bad (some of the self-published work has not even gone through a spell or grammar check). That is why it is great to come across a good zombie effort which seems to be one out of every fifteen. Thankfully, Dixon's The Lifeless is a good one.It stood out because of the uniqueness of how the zombies came to be. Without giving anything away, I thoroughly enjoyed the catalyst event brought about by terrorists. From there the book follows the basic formula of a small band of survivors, interpersonal conflicts, impersonal and overwhelming siege, heroism and cowardice, and thrilling escape. I love this formula and can read it over and over again. Sure I like the introduction of speedy zombies which has been a relatively new component in some books. I much less like thinking zombies, wildlife zombies, and supernaturally possessed zombies. Just give me a disintegrating world where the living are being overwhelmed by the dead and I am a happy zombie-guy.Dixon's effort delivers against my wants and needs. The characters were interesting enough and the pace is solid. The metaphor of Miss Sonia's rapid cancer compared to the spread of the zombie condition is a little clumsy but well meant. Overall a fun read that you can finish in an afternoon.
