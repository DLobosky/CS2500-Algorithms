1/4/09 Update: I compared this product with the JLab JBuds J2 earphones and the Sennheiser NoiseGuard headphones PXC 250. In the Consumer Reports article, the Panasonic is rated above the Sennheiser unit. Based on noise cancelation/isolation alone, I'd rate the Sennheiser as best, then the Panasonic (to my own surprise) only slightly above the JLab product. For music, there are slight differences among these three units, based on different songs/music, but to my ears, not a discernible difference. The product is fine but it is only slightly better in noise isolation to the JLab unit but costs about twice as much.11/28/08 My partner got the Sennheiser for his iPod - I liked the noise reduction feature but found it good but not great.  Interesting to read Chris's comment - confirms we have different perceptions (and tastes, likes, etc...!).  I just read the Consumer Reports 01/2009 article (p. 41) and based on that I'm ordering the Panasonic one to check it out (instead of the super expensive Bose I have been considering but could not see myself paying for it).  I am rating this headphone as a 4-star for now (since I have to rate it so that others can check out the CR article), with the assumption it is at least good (based on both Chris's and the CR rating).  Will add further comments if needed.
