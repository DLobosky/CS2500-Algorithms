To give this movie 5 stars is saying it's a classic right up there with some of the other great 5 star comedies of Duck Soup, Blazing Saddles, Trading Places, Airplane, Caddyshack, and the like. I am sorry, but another check into The Frat Pack, this movie was just trying to hard to be funny, yet it was annoying and obnoxious...and a comedy script was not even present. 3 bigs names, and many high profile cameos, this movie is a dud.   My feeling is the same as it was for the movie Envy which stared Ben Stiller and Jack Black together.   Its worrisome to see so many 5 star reviews and the reviewers where all over 13 years of age...yikes!
