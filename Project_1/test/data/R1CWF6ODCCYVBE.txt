When En Esch and Guenter Schultz left KMFDM because of "creative differences," it seemed like a dark day for the KMFDM/MDFMK nation. This was because both were mainstays in the electronic world that had exclaimed that "ripping the system" was an acceptable medium to focus angst and rage into, and they - at least in my opinion - added a bit of temperament and balance to the overtly political machinations therein. Still, it was an understandable parting of ways because Sasha seemed to appreciate these facets of KMFDM enlightenment less and less as time went on, thinking that perhaps he and only he was the force behind the progression hammer being used. For instance, in their last addition to the band, En Esch was barely heard from at all and Guenter's workmanship wasn't allowed to expressively play throughout the songs, making the band seem more like Sasha's pet project than anything. So, out with the two staples that helped refine the machine and in with two additions that, while likable, leave much to be desired. That said, however, this did allow En Esch and Guenter to go out and run wild, taking their combined prowess and forging one of the best works I've heard in years under the name of Slick Idiot. In it, En Esch does what En Esch does best, growling lyrics in a steamy, almost sadistically erotic fashion, and Gunther plays in his playground and adds to the sounds in only ways he could. Still, it goes well beyond that, too, making it a rival for many a KMFDM album I thought impossible to rival.The reason that it rivals some of KMFDM's best work is because it has some of the main players within the group are seated at its table, and they have the room to experiment within whatever fields they opt to play in. In some ways, the results to this were surprising, to say the least. Here we have what KMFDM did best at one time, with the combination to the safe working through terms like sadism, sexuality, political ideology, and ego and the sound of the tumblers falling in the forms of the industrial/electro machine that the group was best known for. The beats are well designed, the engineering of the lyrics are liquid, and the oddities within some of the songs seem to stay with you and progressively grow on a listener as time passes. Sometimes this makes it sound like something that would have been expected in times of yore, but sometimes this constructs variables that I had yet to hear KMFDM actually try and reap the benefits of. Unlike many of the taken the time to point out, it doesn't reflect back to solo projects of yore either, because En Esch has incorporated an element of learning into the driven songs to take distortion into rap, the world of depraved love and beyond, showing how he's grown since the 80s and his sideproject, Cheesy. This, to me at least, worked wonders on the listening wheel and is one of the better albums I've heard in quite some time. If you're a fan of KMFDM and you enjoyed what they had to showcase in the past, then this is something of a sure bet for consumption. It isn't some run-of-the-mill production that you'll throw to the side after a time and tire of, but its something that you'll instead find yourself listening to over and over again. Even if you aren't a fan of the KMFDM but still like the genre of music, I'd recommend at least checking the album out for consumption. From the day I purchased it until now, over a year later, I haven't found myself disappointed in it.
