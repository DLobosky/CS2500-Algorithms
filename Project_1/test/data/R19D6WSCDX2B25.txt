This book was easily one third too long. The story line in the first 250 pages could have been done in 150 with no loss of impact. Furthermore, this first part could almost stand on its own. As the plot goes further, there are endless pages of unnecessary explanations that sometimes drag onto the point where you want to scream at the pages "Get on with it." For example, the book switches back-and-forth between a first person narrative by the hero and a third person descriptive phase. There are portions, eg. when a character's dress is described in the 3rd person and repeated in the first person, that are entirely unneccessary. Another sample of superfluous verbage happens when a character is described by name, by title and by role in the plot. Once or twice, OK; but when this happens 20 times, it becomes excessive.
 My second complaint, and this may not be fair, is that it takes 400 pages before we start to get the true sense of what is going on. There are at least two small "clues to the plot" earlier in the book (maybe there were more that I missed while I was screaming).
 The next criticism is that the basis of the plot is hardly original and there have been several recent thrillers dealing with the same concept (I'll not name them since that could give away the plot, and you'll just have to wade through the book to find out as I did, or read some of the other reviews that spell everyting out). Next, with all the detail, there is at least one instance of importance where Folsom doesn't provide any detail. It reminded me of the classic Seinfeld line where the character inserts yada-yada-yada to get from one point of a story to another. Finally, you almost have to put this book in the fantasy genre since at least one major plot line and a set-up sub-plot are outrageously improbable.
 OK, then how good is it? Pretty darn good. The length allows Folsom to explore in great depth the characters and also provide extensive (if not excrutiating) detail. As mentioned, there were some ommissions of detail and of course a few hard-to-believe aspects, but it still is a very good story. It also treats the underlying plot complications creatively, and I think at least as creatively as the other books that deal with the subject. (Ha, thought I was going to give it away didn't you!)
