My problem with this book is the same that has been expressed by a couple other reviewers: to wit, does Huizinga really know what was going through the hearts and minds of the people in the particular era and region with which the book deals, as the author and his proselytes claim?  My answer is, in a word,-No.  No book can.  History is an elusive subject under the best of circumstances.Let me cut to the chase.  Huizinga is really not so much interested in demarking the Middle Ages from the Renaissance.  After one gets into the thick of things, it becomes quite obvious that what he's actually about is contrasting the Middle Ages (as he understands or imagines them) from his own historical milieu.  I won't belabor the point: one citation will suffice.  On page 235, Huizinga asseverates that, &quot;There was no great truth of which the medieval mind was more certain than those words from the Corinthians, 'For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.'  They never forgot that everything would be absurd if it exhausted its meaning in its immediate function and form of manifestation, and that all things extend in an mportant way to the world beyond.&quot;  How does he know?  Did he conduct extensive interviews with illiterate serfs whose life expectancy was a fraction of ours and spent almost all their waking hours trying to put food in their bellies? - No, the worldview Huizinga describes above is one common to mystics and poets of all eras and climes.  His very citation of the Corinthians subverts any notion that it was exclusive to the Netherlands in the Middle Ages.Huizinga was essentially an artistic and poetic writer, and the insights one comes away with from his book are such as one might expect from one so gifted: textured and fascinating portraits of a time now lost.  But they are just that, verbal pictures, calling to mind not so much Breughel or any of the other artists whose works are Plated in the middle of the book, but that of the Pre-Raphaelites.This is an enchanting book and well worth the read.  It's just that you may have to hang your critic's hat upon a medieval peg before sitting down to enjoy it.  I trust you have one...a medieval peg that is.
