However, don't let the fact that this movie is buried under generations of more popular and well-known movies stop you from checking it out. "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is criminally underrated, and will grab your interest with its amazing location, haunting atmosphere, enticing characters and ever-thickening plot.Taking place in the beautiful Connecticut countryside, Jessica and friends take some free time after Jessica has been released from a mental hospital. Coming across a mysterious, albeit quite attractive lady, they all share the house on the lakeside before the ever chilling and eerie series of events sets in. Being a psychological horror film that pre-dates "The Shining", "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is original in every sense of the word, and a film far beyond its time, having been made in 1971. The dark and mysterious atmosphere is captivating and at times, almost quite surreal, which makes for a fantastic tone to the movie. The setting of the house and the lake, and all the surrounding scenery adds to the optical beauty, making for some great landscapes for such chilling, psychological events to take place.Overall, this is a great and extremely underrated psychological horror movie that's almost perfect. The only thing I wish would have been changed is the ending; it feels as though the ending was almost rushed and never given a proper conclusion. The other thing that bugs me is not about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The only thing the disc contains is the movie, the scene selection, and the language selection. It's really a loss that there's no special features included on this disc, because I love looking at the special features after a movie. Also, it's a loss because "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is a movie where the bonus material may have been really interesting, especially regarding the nature of the film, how unknown the actors are and how the movie seemed to disappear under years of other horror films.Be that as it may, "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" is an awesome horror movie that should be viewed by anybody interested in surreal, atmospheric horror or psychological horror films. Enjoy this classic in time for Halloween, too! Thanks for the time, and peace.
