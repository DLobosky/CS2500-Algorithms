In book 2, it is one year after Miranda has found her father's family in England. She faces all-new challenges in book two, as she hopes to gain the acceptance of her father's wife, while hoping to cement the future of her relationship with Ian MacGregor. This book is just as wonderful as the first. I highly recommend both books, especially with the upcoming holiday season. These are great reads, and would make great gifts!My Review:I absolutely loved both books in this series (Finding Father Christmas, Engaging Father Christmas)! It was a fast read for me that made me feel warm and peaceful, with a very satisfying ending. I highly recommend both books for personal reading, book club reading (there are include discussion questions) and as books that would be great for gifts!Characters: The original characters from the first book are back, with more emphasis on Ian MacGregor. Mark plays a more central part in this book, and shows how grown-up he is becoming while still retaining his youth. Margaret (Miranda's father's wife) also plays an important role in this story. All of the characters are written well, and help to make the story pull together and flow well.Story-Line: The story-line in both books was easy to follow and very enjoyable. Now that Miranda has a family and friends to call her own (and a long-distance boyfriend), we see how the characters (and her faith) are "engaged" in this book. There are many touching scenes in this story, which help to keep the reader "engaged."Readability: As with the first book, this was an enjoyable, easy read - only taking a few hours to read. I found it hard to put the book down once I started - I loved it SO much!Overall: Another beautifully written book, that will surely be a cherished favorite among holiday stories. It is a nice easy read that could easily be shared with the rest of the family (no questionable scenes or language). readers will fall in love with the characters and ambiance throughout the book. I especially enjoyed the dark green printing in the book instead of the normal black lettering - it helped to complete the holiday feel!
