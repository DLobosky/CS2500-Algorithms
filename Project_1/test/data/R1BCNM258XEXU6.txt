I also loved that she was authentic and seemed like that girl that everyone knows. Jared was just wow! Seriously, he was so sweet and thoughtful. Bronwen and Jared's relationship made sense and kept me reading. The plot was adorable, but at the end, it seemed a bit rushed. I found this book to be very original. McCahan is a lovely writer and I can't wait for more from her. This was a cute book, with some substance. I would recommend this book to fans of Sarah Dessen and the Jessica Darling series.
