We get two of the best episodes from the season here and although the believablility factor is stretched quite a bit on "City...", "Errand of Mercy" is an excellent episode too.  In the former, we get a Hugo Award winner and in the latter, we get to meet the Klingons for the first time!  Both are great reasons to pick up this volume which represent the best of what Star Trek had to offer from its first season.  In "Errand ...", superior beings teach representatives from the Klingon Empire and the Federation an important lesson about coexisting and about settling differences non-violently, something we could all still learn from today too.  Overall, the plot is very good as well as the acting."City..." has become over the years one of the all-time favourite episodes of all Trek fans and I like it too but I have some trouble accepting some of the dramatic licence that this story expects us to take.  For example, when Bones makes his unfortunate leap into the past and changes history, I can't understand why the Enterprise as well as the landing party didn't cease to exist as well.  In any case, if you can ignore this one point, the rest of the episode is a real gem.Highly recommended.
