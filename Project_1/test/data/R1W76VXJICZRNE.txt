You'll find an extensive deconstruction of the "Philadelphia Experiment" which is probably the highlight of the book. It's at times, perhaps, and overkill, but very detailed. Like most of his books, he's in serious need of an editor. Farrell's detective work takes bit of a hit when he starts talking about UFOs and "interplanetary wars." Most of his fellow researchers point to UFOs being government projects, many building on captured German science after the War (see Hitler's Flying Saucers: A Guide to German Flying Discs of the Second World War). And astronomers are becoming more and more convinced that we are alone in the universe (see Lights in the Sky & Little Green Men). Farrell also gets into the "Nazi Bell" which may have been their equivalent to the "Philadelphia Experiment." He previously wrote another book on the subject, but here draws a lot on Hitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology and The Hunt for Zero Point:  Inside the Classified World of Antigravity Technology. Both of those are also must-reads for this subject matter. In fact, Cook's book is really what mainstreamed these topics out of the "fringe" realm. Farrell is basicly reviewing the works of these others and bringing them together in one book.
