For creatheists `God' is a holy name for Ultimate Reality--the all-encompassing Wholeness--that which includes yet transcends all other realities.  Creatheism regards Nature as a revelation or expression of the divine--particularly in its EMERGENT CREATIVITY.  Creatheism understands humanity as a self-reflective aspect of Creation that allows the Wholeness of Reality, seen and unseen, manifest and [not manifest]--i.e., God--to be honored in conscious awareness and to guide our own deliberate manifestations of that divine creativity."The above definition is found in this amazing, well-written, revealing book authored by The Reverend Michael Dowd "one of the most inspiring speakers in America today."This book resolutely bridges the gap between religion and science, resulting in the doctrine or movement defined above called Creatheism.  Who will Creatheism appeal too?  ANSWER: Anyone (theists, atheists, agnostics, etc.).  WHY? Since it's based on what we know (through science), NOT what we believe.The religious aspect of this book is superbly handled by Dowd (who has an impressive array of credentials) with the science aspects of this book being capably detailed by his present wife, the "acclaimed science writer" Connie Barlow (who did not want to be listed as coauthor).  The final book is an effective synthesis of such disciplines as evolutionary psychology, ecology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, cosmology, and theology.   What results from this synthesis?  Answer: A new, exciting, humanistic field called evolutionary spirituality. I have read similar recent books on this subject by scientists who profess to be believers.  What these authors do is either (1) attempt to alter scientific facts or (2) ask the reader just to believe in the supernatural.  Dowd's book does neither.  He respects the intelligence of the reader.A feature of this book is that it contains a wealth of quotations.  My favorite quotation is as follows:"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.  It is the source of all true...science.  He to whom this emotion is a stranger...is as good as dead...This...is at the center of true religiousness.  In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the ranks of devoutly religious [people]."  (Albert Einstein)At the back of the book is a section entitled "Who's Who."  It lists names (I counted over 175 names!!) and briefly states who they are.  (Yes, Einstein is listed.)  These people are either quoted or mentioned in the main narrative of the book.  I recommend that you photocopy this section instead of constantly flipping back to the book's end.Finally, another feature of this book is that it contains stories (highlighted on a gray background).  I counted almost 55 of them!!  These stories are used by Dowd to make a point.  My two favorites are entitled:(1)  Evolution: Theory and Fact(2) "Finally, a God that makes sense!"In conclusion, this is a unique book that may end the heated debate between science and religion.  I leave you with Dowd's final paragraph in his acknowledgements section:"Finally, I acknowledge the contributions of generation upon generation of scientists and evolutionary thinkers.  I'm mostly an evangelist...[and] a storyteller.  The real saints in this movement are those who labor in their labs or in the field, often without the public recognition they so rightfully deserve."(first published 2007;  author's promises;  prologue;  introduction;  5 parts or 18 chapters;  conclusion;  epilogue;  main narrative 325 pages;  2 appendices;  invitation;  acknowledgements;  resources;  online resources;  who's who;  index;  about the author)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX
