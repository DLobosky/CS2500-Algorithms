I was greatly ministered to by this book as James Langteaux does not depart from the simplicity of Christ. Through deep impassioned scripting James opens the scroll of GOD's love for the whole world, a love that will change the world one heart at a time.   I was blessed by the simple message of just believing GOD and this book did stir up the GIFT in me, Jesus Christ, and what was my trust really in. This book has and is crucial to my continued growth in the Lord as it challenged me. As Christians we need to be challenged as to what we really believe about our Father and what/who we trust. Read this book and be blessed and allow the work of the Holy Spirit to rend your Heart to let the Love of Jesus change you into HIS image.   James is very real about his faith and doubts and the life he lives. This is remarkably refreshing and someone you can truly relate to. I found a kinship in trials and doubts that plagued the author but reading how GOD used them and brought forth the treasures of darkness is very encouraging. This is a book of eternal love and life. GOD bless you and may your relationship and communion with the Father grow deeply and may HE use you to change those hearts to eternal life starting with yours.  JB
