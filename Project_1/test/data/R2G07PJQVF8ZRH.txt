Michael has so much talent. Good album and good VHS. I just descovered this page on amazon and I hope that a DVD version will be avaliable.  I am writing the first review so hopefully I can get a certificate so I can get it as soon as possible.  The DVD should contain the same stuff that the VHS one contains (maybe the publishers may put in more features) The video (and assumingly the DVD as well) contains all but 3 songs from the DANGEROUS album (I Can't Let Her Get Away, She Drives Me Wild, &amp; Keep The Faith). The Video and most likely the DVD contains the full videos of: -Black or White (controversy, plus making of)-Remember The Time (behind scenes)-Jam (behind scenes Michael Jordan comentary)-In The Closet (an awesome MJ song and video, plus behind scenes) -Heal the World (two times, super bowl performance and the video) -Will You Be There (the complete and non-Free Willy version)-Gone Too Soon (about that kid with AIDS that everyone forgot about)-Dangerous (played while showing us snip shots from ihs concert world tour)-Why You Wanna Trip On Me (played durring the credits)-Give Into Me (Michael knows good rock with Slash)-Who Is It (done by the director of FIGHT CLUB, excellent beat)-(Bonus stuff) of 2 awards and a pretty deep speech from Michael and a little Michael singing with Michael &quot;I'll Be There&quot;Lets hope this wish of having avaliable this long awaited DVD comes true and we may get it.  Michael still has fans in the USA, so let them have their DVD!
