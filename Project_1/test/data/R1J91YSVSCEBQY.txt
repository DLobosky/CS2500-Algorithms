This is the first of the Harry series, of which we have three.  All of those books are consistently good quality, rather similar (Harry gets into trouble, there are misunderstandings, everybody gets along fine in the end).  This one is very appealing and our boy asked for it many many times, until finally (after a few dozen readings over a period of many months, ages 1-2) he got a little bored with it.  Highly recommended, one of our favorites.
