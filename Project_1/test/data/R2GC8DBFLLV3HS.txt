A lot of people are going to disagree with me on this, but here is the list for the complete Star Wars chronicles- all 9 episodes we've been promised for ages- all now available on dvd:1. The Phantom Menace (1999)- Episode One2. Attack Of The Clones (2002)- Episode Two3. Star Wars Animated Adventures: EWOKS (Double Feature:  The Haunted Village & Tales From The Endor Woods)(1996)  This 1996 cartoon series has 8 of the approx. 15 Season One  episodes condensed into what they are trying to sell as 2 "films".  However, the chapters are labeled by the original episode titles.  The storyline here takes place between Episode 2: Attack Of The  Clones and Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith.4. The Clone Wars (2008)- Animated Movie  (The storyline takes place in between ATTACK OF THE CLONES and  REVENGE OF THE SITH- in order for George Lucas to expand on the  storyline more and of course add tons of new characters.)5. The Clone Wars - The Complete Season One (2009)6. The Clone Wars - The Complete Season Two (2010)7. The Clone Wars - The Complete Season Three (2010)8. Revenge Of The Sith (2005)- Episode Three9. Star Wars Animated Adventures: DROIDS (Double Feature-  The Pirates & The Prince and Treasures Of The Hidden Planet)  This story line takes place after Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith.  This cartoon series has 8 of the approx. 15 episodes from Season  Two condensed into what they are trying to sell as 2 "films".  However, the chapters are labeled by the original episode titles.10. A New Hope (1977)- Episode Four11. The Star Wars Holiday Special (aka Life Day Celebration)-  (Nov.1978) - Episode Five  Face it, it has the same real characters from  Star Wars- Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Chewbacca, R2D2,  C3PO, etc., and it has a plot (a silly one) and is not a cheap  cartoon, therefore, it is considered part of the continuing saga.  Since George Lucas declared he will never release this on dvd, you will just  have to find your copy on e*bay or ioffer or etc.12. The Empire Strikes Back - (1980) - Episode Six13. Return Of The Jedi (1983) - Episode Seven14. Ewoks Adventure: Caravan of Courage (1984) - Episode Eight15. Ewoks Adventure: The Battle For Endor (1985) - Episode Nine  (These 2 Ewoks tv movies are available on a 2-on-1 dvd.  If these Ewoks  played such a huge part in the Return Of The Jedi movie, then why  can't these 2 movies be considered episodes 8 and 9? They are the  same Ewoks, not a cheap cartoon, and deserve to be part of the  continuing saga.)Since George Lucas has now declared there will not be anymore Star Warsmovies, just the continuing cartoon series, like The Clone Wars, I have declared the above 9 episodes to now be the complete Star Wars chronicles- and it cannot and will not ever be changed.
