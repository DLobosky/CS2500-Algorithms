Both drives I received are running perfectly in a Voyager Q Hard Drive Docking Station (FireWire® 800/400/USB 2.0/eSATA SATA I/II) connected by Firewire 800 to my Mac Pro.  Run cool and relatively quietly.  Great price/capacity at today's prices for backup drives.Main reason for adding yet another review is to comment on the packaging, since there are many reviews and photos here of badly packaged drives.  Both of these drives, as well as another Caviar Black, well packaged, primarily by Western Digital themselves.  Apparently enough complaints about OEM drive packaging (and returns) have got them packing the drives the same as retail drives, other than in generic brown boxes.  Each drive was in its own heavy cardboard box with plastic holders isolating it from all sides of the box.  These boxes were in turn put inside an Amazon box with ample air packs.
