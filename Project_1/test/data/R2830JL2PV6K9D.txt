A young monk on the religious fence agrees to guide some of the Bishop's soldiers to a remote village which has somehow managed to avoid being effected by the plague. His real reason for guiding the soldiers is to visit his girlfriend and see what side of the fence he will come down on. The soldiers are sure of what they will find and have weapons and instruments of torture to make things right. Of course, things go awry and it makes for a great ride.Some great decisions were made in this movie. It has a good look and feel. This might be the only movie I've seen that gave me a genuine sense of what life might have been like back then. The costuming, buildings, ubiquitous death and despair were all present. It was shot well. Sometimes the camera was steady and sometimes it moved and the blend was good. I was drawn into the scenes. The casting was good. The band of soldiers was a group of individuals. They didn't run together. The casting agent made sure they didn't all look alike so you could pick each one out in a given scene, and they were all allotted as much personality as possible given the circumstances. The story worked well too. Certain things happened sooner than I expected so it made me wonder where the proceedings would go from there. The Catholic Church has garnered a bad reputation in regard to that period of history and this movie doesn't shy away from showing them in a less than favorable light. These soldiers of God are on a mission and they are going to do what they are going to do no matter what they find. It's a no win situation for whomever is involved. I did wonder how the story would be resolved and was more than pleased with the ending. All too often films move like a freight train only to slip the tracks in the final scenes. Here I felt things stayed true.This is a good movie that, at 102 minutes, is the right length for the content. It gives a good historical perspective yet maintains an innate ability to entertain.
