My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry".  With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am usually disappointed in my recent cookbook acquisitions.  I am also very tough on Italian cookbooks in particular.This book is a wonderful addition to any Italian cookbook library.  If you were looking for a good basic Italian cookbook to begin your Italian cooking library this would make a wonderful start.  This cookbook is simple Italian cooking at its best.  Most of the recipes in this book are quick (Panettone excluded).  I always use the cannoli recipe from this book, with a little creative license taken here and there.The author also does a nice job of highlighting the regional differences in preparing dishes.  I highly recommend this book for anyone that is interested in learning more about Italian cooking.The book is subdivided as follows:1.	Antipasto2.	Soups3.	Egg Dishes4.	Cheese5.	Fish and Shellfish6.	Meat7.	Poultry8.	Game9.	Macaroni, Spaghetti and Rice10.	Pizza11.	Vegetables12.	Salads13.	Desserts14.	BeveragesMy one criticism of the book is in the directions themselves.  If you are an accomplished cook the directions are more than adequate.  However, if you are a cooking novice the directions are a little lacking.  I think this is due to the original publishing date of 1950.  This book was written in a time when all women had been taught to cook by their mothers.  Sadly, this is not the case today.  However, if you have any level of proficiency in the kitchen you should be able to follow the recipes.This little book is much more complete than I expected it to be when I bought it a decade ago.  The book does not give a recipe count, but I would say that it contains a minimum of 500 recipes and probably more than that.I always turn to this little volume when I am looking for a recipe and then compare other cookbooks to what I find in this one.  If you are need to expand your Italian cookbook collection you can't go wrong with this little book.  Don't expect photographs though, the book is just text.
