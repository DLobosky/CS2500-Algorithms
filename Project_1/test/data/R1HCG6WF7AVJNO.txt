I bought this for my new panasonic lumix camera zs1. Fitted beautifully and worked like a charm. Have not encountered any problems at all. I eventually gave it to my daughter for her samsung digital as I wanted the bigger Transcend 16GB card. I am too lazy to download stuff to the computer and would like massive space in the camera to store hundreds of photos and movies. This 8GB, though is good enough for normal use and I never reached the stage of even beginning to fill up the memory of the card. Its just my greed that made me change to a 16GB.
