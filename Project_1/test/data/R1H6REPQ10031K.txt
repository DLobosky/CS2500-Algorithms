I looked into USB based WiFi adapters because the PCMCIA slot in my laptop suddenly stopped working. I approached this rather cautiously as I was concerned about the range. The early reviews I saw indicated that USB based adapters had a much shorter range than PCMCIA wireless cards.I am very glad I got this device for $29.99 after rebate..(at a local retailer who is the best buy I know :-)).  This just worked perfectly right out of the box (Hint, read the slim manual D-link ships with the device). I was in for a pleasant surprise on another front: the wireless range is amazing.  I have my SMC wireless router on the second floor; my office is in the basement. The signal strength is pretty decent in the basement office ...I clocked the transfer speed at 2.5 Mbps in speed tests. Not bad for a signal traveling two floors! I get pretty good reception all over the house - it is as good as what I used to get with my Orinoco Gold PCMCIA based card (which is believed to have the best range in its class).  Overall, I would strongly recommend this to anyone. A few words of caution:a) Be careful when you pry the cap off the adapter. It fits on real tight and I almost cracked the device. Page 4 in the manual shows you the little trick you need to open the cap.b) I stongly recommend that you download the latest version of the driver available at the D-Link site. The latest version (v 3.00.04 for Win2000) is much better than what came on the CD shipped with the item.
