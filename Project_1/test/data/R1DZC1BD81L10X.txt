Hey, I thought, only $1.59, and look at all the 5 star reviews! At least on the Kindle it is a very short 'book'. By the time you click through the `blurbs' by unknown people saying how great the book is, the title page, the copyright page, the acknowledgement page, the dedication page, a photograph of the woman the dedication page is dedicated to, the table of contents, some `order form', two photographs of coastline, `A Preview' section written by one William Phenn, then "A Three Part introduction by the Author" (again talking about how wonderful he and the book is), and finally get to the first page of the actual book, why you have already been through 10 percent of the Kindle book! Then you get into a stream of consciousness bit of writing. Has something to do with the author being a teacher's assistant or such, who moves to California from India. He refers to himself as `the hero', then "Y", etc. I quickly get bogged down in mishmash of stuff, some involving computers, interspersed with photos of a bus, staircase, etc. Simply unreadable. The book is divided into three parts. The last part has to do with the big wildfire in San Diego (or around it). It is entitled "The Inferno". Somewhat interesting if you did not read the news about the fire. Please look at the `reviews'. For each reviewer, click on `See all my reviews". Every single `other' review by said reviewer is about other books by Kalpanik. Every...single....one. Oh! And each `review' was found `very helpful' by at least several people! Ah, how the reviewers like to speak of how funny and poignant this author is! He will make you weep and wish to turn over a new leaf and become a `good person'. Look at how all the favorable reviews are dated within the same week. Anyway, it is obvious that the `reviewers' are friends and/or students of the author. They all give glowing reviews for a product that is not worth even $1.59 (much less the price for this paperback edition), and they give the same reviews for this author's other works. Skip buying this or any other work by this 'author'.  By the way: the blonde girl pictured has nothing to do with the book at all.
