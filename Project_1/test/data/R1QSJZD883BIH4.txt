If you do not have a blood tracking light this is a good one along with the Remington headlight Remington RMBTHL-B Blood Tracker 3-N-1 LED Headlight I own both. If you have not used a blood tracker here is how it works. Deer move around at dusk. Many are shot just before dark and run after they are shot. When you set this light to tracking it filters out the other shades of color and you only see the red of the blood. Making the deer very easy to find in the dark of night. Then you can turn on the white light and dress the deer. This is a great gift for any hunter.You may need these too.Rayovac AAA Alkaline Batteries - 15 Pack exp. date 2017CLC Sportsman Mossy Oak 1111M  24-inch Gear Bag, "WEEKENDER"CLC Sportsman M125X Mossy Oak Backcountry Gloves - Size X Large
