The former "Trunk Murderer" is out of the asylum and posing as a housekeeper goes to work for her estranged daughter (Gloria -- now a vicar's wife). Grace goes about fixing everything and everyone using a shovel, a frying pan, an iron and her own charming and somewhat twisted logic.When Gloria discovers what's going on, she says, "You can't go 'round killing people just because you don't approve of them".   To which Grace responds -- "That's what my doctors used to say. It was the one point we could never agree on." For some reason, Grace is able to make murder seem like a perfectly logical solution. Once Gloria finds out that Grace is really her mother, chaos ensues and murder becomes a family affair. Don't miss this little lesson on the importance of family values!
