When I heard that Kino was releasing this restored version I was really excited, as they are one of the top "classic film" reissuing companies. Upon watching this DVD (I don't have a blu-ray player and the contents on both the BD and the standard DVD are the same) I realized it was worth the wait. Pieces of the story that made no sense before were now brought into focus (no pun intended). And the score sounds great, Other reviews posted here will tell you more of the technical details, and I see quite a few comments about how the footage restored from the recently discovered 16mm print, should have been "cleaned up" before this release was made. My opinion is that such a task will take years and I may not be here to see it. At least now we have the best, and as complete, print one could hope for.The bonus materials are superb too. There is a full-length documentary on the making of and restoration of the film. Of course, I'd loved to have seen the actual lab work that was done. But I can't really gripe. The brief interview with the curator of the archive in Buenos Aires - where the missing footage was located - is like a detective story and certainly adds to understanding how this restoration came to be. On most DVDs, I prefer to watch the bonus features ( the now-requisite "Making of...." Featurette, deleted scenes, etc) after watching the feature. In the case of this release, I recommend that you watch the Bonuses (which are on a separate second disc) before settling in to watch the film. I think you'll appreciate the restoration even more.We all owe the folks at Kino a great deal of gratitude for making this film available so soon after the footage was located and putting together a class package at a price well below what Criterion would have listed it at.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
