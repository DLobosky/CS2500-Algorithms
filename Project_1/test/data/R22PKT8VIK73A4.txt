There is no cardio and the muscle groups are worked individually.  This allows you to focus on the muscle being worked but it doesn't get the heart rate up like working multiple muscle groups together does.  The only equipment used is hand weights.  There is an option for using barbells in many of the segments.  In addition to Jari, there are 3 other expercisers present, each demonstrating a different modification of the exercise (beginner through advanced).  This video does a lot of squats and lunges which, while great for the lower body, may pose a problem to anyone with knee issues.  The exercises are mostly basic solid strength training.  There are dead lifts, push ups, squats, lunges, tricep dips, ect.  This is not a video for someone who wants to learn new innovative moves. It is better for those of us who want a fully laid out workout that hits every muscle group.
