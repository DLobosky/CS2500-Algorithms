If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it.  Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject.  Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925.  He spent 5-1/2 years writing it.  The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin.  There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but  this is the one history book on it all.  Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet.
