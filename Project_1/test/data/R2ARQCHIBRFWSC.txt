This is "hosted" by Louis Prima Jr. who is a bit stiff and keeps saying "my father did" a lot. But Lauro was smart in indexing these intros so you can skip ahead on repeat viewings. The performances are - of course - great and all are complete songs - except one. The earliest is "Loch Lomond" from 1937 film  (great print but the sound is muffled) and last is Prima in 1971 with a young band - but still Sam Butera. There are some Keely Smith (his first wife and singing partner for seven years) numbers and some Gia Maione (later his second wife and singing partner) numbers and a lot from Ed Sullivan shows. (One from a Doris Day show too!). A nice selection. The bonuses total 25 minutes. The longest is the rare 15-minute short "Swing It" from 1936. The sprocket must have stuck once or twice but the film is still fun. Then there is "Sing Sing Sing" (the Prima composition that became Benny Goodman's theme song) from 1943's Big Band Parade, A complete song in color from the Dinah Shore program comes next, followed by the funny "Story about the dog" from a 1965 Bob Hope Special. The "Bonuses" close with Louis Jr.and his band performing "Jump Jive and Wail" in Vegas. This last piece was filmed from the back of the room and the sound comes from the house speaker system so - sadly - there is a LOT of echo. The package includes a four-page color booklet with a nice 3-page essay (uncredited by probably by Lauro) and two photos from the Prima archive. But - for Prima fans - I can recommend this DVD that is a LOT cheaper than the price PBS stations were charging during their begathons. And for those who only know Prima from Disney's The Jungle Book or his recordings used in commercials or on soundtracks, this is a great chance to experience one of THE hardest working guys on the Las Vegas nightclub scene.I was going to deduct a star for the sound on Louis Jr's performance in the bonuses. But the other rare material here more than offsets that so the DVD gets five stars.Discover Louis. There will never be another like him! Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
