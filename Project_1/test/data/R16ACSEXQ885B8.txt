Plot Line (from back cover)The body count continues in this vivid thriller, the fourth&#65533;but not final&#65533;story in the wildly successful Friday the 13th series. Jason, Crystal Lake&#65533;s least popular citizen, returns to wreak more havoc. After his revival in a hospital morgue, the hockey-masked murderer fixes his vengeful attention on the Jarvis family and a group of hitherto carefree teenagers. Young Tommy Jarvis is an aficionado of horror films, with a special talent for masks and makeup. Has the diabolical Jason finally met his match?My remarks toward this pictureThis one certainly takes a much more serious approach than the last installment in the, as the synopsis on the back of the cover gladly admits, wildly successful Friday the 13th series. And for once it didn&#65533;t rely on some whinny, annoying female to defeat the villain, but rather a male, a young boy by the name of Tommy Jarvis, played by what I think is one of the only actors in the entire series to really have a successful movie career subsequent to his appearance in it, being Corey Feldman. The leading character&#65533;s performance, being Feldman&#65533;s of course, was something that for once can be noticed for its genius, rather than the amusement of its debility. Crispin Glover, who co-starred, also does a good job as a sex-crazed geek whose insecurities are the one factor which dominate his fine looks and peculiarly enchanting personality.Fans have said that this is the most compelling installment of all, and although I&#65533;d have to disagree&#65533;for the third continues to be&#65533;I still very much enjoyed it. (I gave it a top rating at five out of five, didn&#65533;t I?) It also had a likeable cast of characters. It had some great suspenseful elements. Great special effects. Graphical and highly disturbing death sequences for all those who crave for the extreme and the repugnant. (That surgical hacksaw to the throat and the breaking of the night for Jason&#65533;s first victim was really something, shown in heartless detail that would have topped the rest of the deaths out of the four installments that were yet made if it wasn&#65533;t for Andy&#65533;s in the third, where he is cut in half with a machete while walking on his hands. After he buries that hacksaw to Axel&#65533;s throat, he just twists off his head, just like that! Goddamn!) And, overall, an actor who knew just how to portray, as the synopsis on the back of the cover also says, Crystal Lake&#65533;s least popular citizen. (In its day, anyway.)The only major gap in the film is near its conclusion.Struggling to save her life, Tommy&#65533;s sister does all she can to get away from the madman who at this time subverted virtually all other existence of humanity within the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, while Tommy, in hopes of saving both their lives, is busy shaving his head in aim to somehow appear as if he was the madman&#65533;s mother despite of the fact that Mrs. Voorhees always had a full head of hair. (And didn&#65533;t wear little kids&#65533; cloth. And obviously wasn&#65533;t a male!) Anyhow, having done so, Tommy ultimately comes face-to-face with his opponent and acts as if he was his own flesh and blood by giving orders, an action that actually came to a success and prevented the death of his sister and rather was the basis for the death of her tormenter. This not only ridicules Jason but the film itself, and ruins the tension that was felt prior to such imbecility. But then again, despite of such weak writing, you should always have at least one good laugh before the end of each Friday the 13th film. It&#65533;s good to have one with friends. It somehow wouldn&#65533;t feel right otherwise. So it&#65533;s all-good. I would strongly suggest any fan of the series, or a fan of the genre itself even, to go out and purchase this one, because, after all, most of them chose this one as being their favorite.
