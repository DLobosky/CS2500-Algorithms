At times I think that he is going into way to much background about what happened in previous books, but then I realize that I have spent a couple of hours reading and enjoying the story as well as the reminder of previous events.  So, at first what I find a criticism I then discover I really enjoy the way it is done.The story picks up where the last installment left off.  Castillo and his band of men are asked to "retire" by the President of the United States.  They are going to do exactly that, they are going to disappear off the face of the earth.  But then the President dies unexpectedly and the Vice President takes over.  The new President, Clendennen, is not a fan of Lt. Col. Castillo.  He is also not happy that he was never in the loop regarding the previous Presidents use of Castillo and his group at OOA.  What he is most frustrated about is that he was never consulted or given details on why his predecessor felt the need to destroy 20 square miles of African jungle.  When he is finally informed, he tells everyone that he hopes Castillo falls off the face of the earth and doesn't interfere in any more government work.There is only one small problem.  It turns out that not all of the Congo-X biological Chemicals were destroyed and someone is sending samples of it to the U.S. Government.  It turns out the Russians are behind this and their desire is to trade the Congo-X chemicals to the U.S. Government in exchange for their two SVR agents that Castillo helped to defect in the last book.  They also want Lt. Col. Castillo.  Why?  Because they aren't happy with his interference with their operation or his hand in the killing of several of their agents.This should be a no brainer, tell the Russians NO.  But President Clendennen thinks that if he turns over Castillo and the two defectors that all his political problems will just melt away.  As Griffin puts it, "Clendennen loves to throw his own people under the bus when it serves his purposes."What I found interesting and a bit distasteful is that many in the employ of the President don't see any harm in turning Castillo over to the Russians.  What ever happened to loyalty to someone who has served their country well?That is what this whole book becomes about.  Who will be loyal to Castillo and who will side with the President because they want to cover their political backsides as well as their careers, both political and militarily.You will be surprised by how some of the characters from previous books will turn out.  You will find that once you start this book you can't put it down.  I'm happy that I got it over the holiday's so that I had extended time to read. If you are a W.E.B. Griffin fan you will not be disappointed.  Even the addition of a second writer doesn't seem to effect the quality, at least in my opinion.This a fun read, enjoy!
