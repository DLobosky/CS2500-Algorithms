I must say, I was really expecting this movie to be really bad.  After six movies, what could they do with the storyline?  But, I really liked it!  The only reason that I didn't give &quot;Halloween H20&quot; five out of five stars was because I really missed the late, great actor Donald Pleasence (Dr. Sam Loomis.)
