I've had this Blu-Ray player for about three weeks now and it's great!  Pros:*It does a great job of playing Blu-Rays on my Samsung UN46D6400 television. The picture and audio quality are great.*It does a great job of playing dvds on my Samsung UN46D6400 television. For both Blu-rays and dvds I did, though, set the automotion plus on the t.v. to "clear" from the default of "standard".  I think it made the picture look a little more natural but that would depend on your personal preference.  Also, setting automotion (on the t.v.) to "clear" eliminated occasional "jitters" in the picture when playing dvds.* This is more than just a Blu-ray player because it also has Samsung's Smart Hub which has several apps options to choose from. The Youtube and Vudu apps are outstanding.*Disc load times seem fairly fast. Not quite as fast as a standard dvd player, but not too much longer.*Slot loading so no disc drawer :)*Two HDMI outs! This is great for running one to the t.v. and one to a receiver if you want to.  I play Pandora a lot through my stereo and don't have to leave the t.v. on if I don't want to*Nice remote but not back-lit, though*When you insert a disc into the player it will automatically turn on AND turn your Samsung t.v. on at the same time AND automatically select the correct input if you set it to do so.  You can turn this feature off if you need to.*  BD Wise (a Samsung proprietary feature that is supposed to "talk" to your Samsung t.v. and choose the best picture settings) works great for Blu-Rays.  I only had to make minor adjustments.Cons:*Some of the apps in the Smart Hub are excellent such as Youtube. Some of the apps definitely feel half-baked and not ready for prime time. App selection could be more robust.*  As another reviewer pointed out (and I just discovered this myself), when an app is updated it can wipe all of your settings for that app.  So, the videos I had saved on the Youtube app disappeared.  Very disappointing.  Hopefully, this will get ironed out.*It has a silver top. I'm not crazy about silver a.v. components.*I have not tried out the 3-D functionality yet so I can't comment on that.  Also, there is a setting in which you can delay the audio to ensure that it syncs with the blu-ray or dvd you are playing.  I have not (knock on wood) had a problem with audio-syncing yet so I haven't had to use that feature, but it makes me suspicious.  Shouldn't the audio and video ALWAYS sync?
