This was a fabulous young adult novel. Don't let the title fool you. Even though the heroine had psychic powers, she was ultimately a fifteen-year-old girl who just wants to fit in at her new high school and be accepted by her friends. She was a likeable protagonist whom readers can easily relate to. She was not stunningly gorgeous and popular neither was she over-the-top sarcastic or tragically poor. She was just an average teenage girl dealing with a unique talent and wanting to fit in. I loved the fact that it was such a realistic representation of juvenile life. The setting was solid, it was nice to experience the location through the eyes of someone who has just moved there. The entire cast of characters were compelling because they were typical and also easy to connect to. I highly recommend you pick up this book and be sure to get a copy for any young woman in your life. This was such a poignant novel that I just know I will read it again and again. This author is going on my must-read list. - Theresa Joseph
