Ok, first it's my fault for not actually paying attention to the measurements, but this "beach" towel is extremely small.  In fact, I'll probably just end up using it as a bath towel.  I bought this in anticipation of my trip to Hawaii and was very disappointed when I received it.  It is also extremely thin and thus, not very suitable for the beach.  The slightest gust of wind blew the towel up and we ended up having to weigh the corners down with our sandals.  I recommend looking elsewhere for an actual beach towel.  It is nice looking and a decent multi-purpose towel, just not for the beach.
