The great thing about DVD is that you may be able to program the order of the chapters, which is very useful for a Quentin Tarantino film. This is why people should own DVDs of Tarantino's films. Reservoir Dog DVD owners should try something new when watching this film. Try watching it in chronological order. Set your DVD player in Program mode, set and play the chapter in this order: 8, 11, 17, 18, 19, 15, 16, 1, 2, 20, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 21, and 22. If you play the chapters in this order, you will discover a different experience. You will see a slow build up of the characters into a violent explosion. And check my review for Pulp Fiction for the chronological order.
