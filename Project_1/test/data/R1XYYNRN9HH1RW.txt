THE FINAL is dangerous and exploitative cinema that hides behind a mask of sophistication, when truthfully it reshapes horrifying real-life events in order to champion human monsters. Using Columbine and other school shootings as its source, THE FINAL follows a groups of rejected teens as they torture their tormentors at a Halloween party that they designed to be a deathtrap. On a technical level, the film barely earns a passing grade. It is adequately shot and nicely dressed, but the pacing suffers severely during the extended torture segments, and the characters are each hollow stereotypes. The script finds no voice of its own, and only regurgitates the pseudo-intellectual rationalities found in the journals and recordings of teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Any attempts at social, political, or religious commentary fail on all fronts due to the forceful approach and the unnatural monologues given by each of the characters. THE FINAL also perpetuates the stereotypes that Horror movies and Rock 'N Roll have a catalytic effect on teens that leads them to commit violent crimes. Worst of all, it delivers the message that the killers were justified in their actions, and even goes so far as to say that God allowed the events to happen. There are no consequences whatsoever, and in the end, the killers achieve their twisted goals when their victims are scorned by the people around them due to their new disfigurements. THE FINAL shows teens that violence is an acceptable answer to their problems in life. In a post-Columbine America, this is simply unacceptable. The filmmakers would be hard-pressed in justifying their decisions, and any attempt to claim the film as 'artistic expression' would be a lame attempt at excusing their obvious intentions. Unfortunately, this sort of notoriety will only throw the film back into the spotlight, when it should be shelved and forgotten before it gets in the wrong hands. -Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies
