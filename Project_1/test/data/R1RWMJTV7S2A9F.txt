first movie loads of fun - a real swashbuckler - good for mature 9 years and older with parent supervision to assure it isn't real. Great for the whole family - should watch together though. We weren't sure at first but our 9 yr. old girl finds most of it pretty humorous. We don't have regular TV, only movies, she isn't exposed to a lot of violence but she totally gets this is all make-up and hollywood. Watch them all!
