Wow! Once again an academic with an important piece of the truth about the nature of contemporary social reality has become embroiled in an avalanche of escalating public expectations and hyperbole until suddenly he is  expected to be some kind of social prophet who's singularly able to  explain, detail and unravel the heretofore-mysterious elements of our  dilemma. Such is the case here with Professor Putnam's provocative findings  regarding social disintegration in the America of the `90s.This is an  absorbing book, the result of Putnam's efforts to expand a short article  Putnam had written regarding the observable facts of increasing social  isolation and personal disconnection within our culture. Here he employs  new data substantiating and extending the details of his original thesis,  indicating that on almost every measure investigated, individual Americans  are less likely to regularly socialize with their peers, becoming more  isolated, more fractious, and less friendly to others than they have been  in the recent past. The book is written in an engaging way, and entertains  and seduces the reader with amusing (as well as frightening) facts and  figures regarding the degree of animosity and alienation individual  citizens feel. Of course, it is easy to become so enthralled with  reading through the entertaining list of particulars he enumerates than to  pay heed to the burgeoning shapes and images lurking beneath the data;  i.e., concerned readers should engage themselves in locating all this  information usefully within a meaningful social context. Increasing social  isolation and the progressive breakdown in what sociologists call social  cohesion are not new phenomena, but have been steadily eroding the social  fabric and our feelings of connectedness to one another for over a century.  In fact, at the turn of the 20th century both Emile Durkheim and Max Weber  were warning of the social dangers associated with the rise of a rational,  secular and materialistic social milieu. Reading other recent books such as  Sales Kirkpatrick's "Rebels Against The Future" or Philip Slater's classic  1970 book "Pursuit of Loneliness" give one a much better grounding in how  the degree of social isolation and civil alienation are related to what is  happening in the larger social surround individuals find themselves in.  In essence, the kinds of isolation detailed so well in this tome are the  result of the long-term corrosive effects of materialism, with  concentration on capital acquisition and gaining more wealth and more  affluent lifestyles. Indeed, if one reads the recent book "The Overworked  American" by Juliet Schor, one gets the distinct impression that many  Americans are so focused on "getting ahead' that anything interfering with  this obsessive reach for greater material security gets short shrift in  contemporary society. There should be no confusion about the nature of the  problem that confronts us; we have no community because we have no culture  left. The revolution of scientific change and technical innovation has  systematically swept away the web of meanings we once had to integrate and  make sense of all this. All we really have today is a mutual acquisition  society, based primarily on our mutual lust for material goods and  minimally constrained by the skeletal rules and regulations civil society  sets for the nature of the material quest. This is a terrific book. Read  it.
