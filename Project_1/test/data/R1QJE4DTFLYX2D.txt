It's a fun game and it is challenging.  It sort of remind's me of the old school super mario games for the super nintendo only instead of mario the character is Garfield. It's an interesting game.  I will admit at first I did struggle a little bit with the game but the more I played it seemed be right in the middle not to hard yet not to easy either I like it.If your looking for a good DS game I would recommend this game.  Oh and this game doesn't use the touch screen very much at all except for the mini games. Go figure.
