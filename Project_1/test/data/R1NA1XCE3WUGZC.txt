In the previous story, Mo and Meggie had some trouble with characters from the Inkworld, a realm where one man's work of fiction has fully come to life. Mo lost his wife Resa to the Inkworld when he read the fire-controlling entertainer Dustfinger out of the Inkworld. Now the evil Capricorn is dead and Meggie's mother Resa is finally back in the real world, but the story is far from over. Dustfinger finds a way to get back to the Inkworld and rejoins the family he left ten years ago, but his apprentice Farid follows him, as does Meggie. Now, Inkworld villains are threatening Meggie's family on Earth while she, Farid, and Dustfinger are also in mortal danger in the Inkworld, where Fenoglio, the world's creator no longer has control over his own tale and the bad guys are winning, even when they're not supposed to.   The first misstep this book made, in my opinion, was having Meggie decide to go to the Inkworld just because she's obsessed with seeing it for herself. I know that Meggie had to be in the Inkworld in order for the plot to work, but I wish it hadn't been a move she made of her own free will, because she has to go against all logic and wisdom to enter that realm. In the previous book, Inkheart, it was proven that the Inkworld is a source of a lot of pain and villainy, against which Meggie has no defense, and to top off an already poor choice, Meggie is relying on chance to ever return home! Even though she's just 13, Meggie has enough sense not to go to a scary, cruel place just because it has brightly-colored fairies and magical forests, so it's surprising when she makes this not-so-brilliant move.Another thing I disliked was the very violent tone of the book and its plentiful references to hangings, mutilation, and chopped-off limbs. It's not that Mid-Grade readers can't handle a bit of violence, but almost the whole of the book is focused on some element of human misery. Fenoglio is accused of not being able to write characters unless they are vicious or miserable, and in Inkspell itself, there are very few characters who don't fall under either description. Death and separation seem to be decreed for the whole cast of characters.On the other hand, the book has a few brilliant moments when it addresses some really interesting questions about freewill. Fenoglio re-creates the dead prince Cosimo without regard to the consequences of bringing back a living mannequin to rule Ombra. Fenoglio is willingly blind to the limits of his own power; he likes tromping about inside his own favorite world and thinking that he can affect the troubling elements that have made the plot veer off course, but his strength is woefully limited.The Inkheart stories are immensely popular books, so they clearly have an audience, but this book doesn't work for me. There's too much violence and sorrow, too little humor, and too many storylines. Some books feel rich and dense because of their many characters and locations, but this book feels overcrowded. It seems like some editing might have helped, because my copy of the book is over 600 pages, and it feels like the same story could have been told in 400. For me, the wonderful fantasy of Inkspell is hampered by the abundance of characters and POVs and the darkness of the supposedly mid-grade-appropriate world.
