THIS IS THE BEST BOOK ON RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE EVER READ.  Most hard-core Christians probably wouldn't consider me a Christian because I receive the Bible in its allegorical and metaphysical meaning and not the literal sense (although some is literal)... so I wanted to touch base on that aspect of it for those that are turned off by "Christian books".  This book does have slight Christian undertones to it but it's not disturbing from the point of the book.  I have read a T-O-N of books on relationships and this (along with For Men Only) is truly THE BEST set of books on relationships that I have ever read. While this book wouldn't have prevented my divorce, it would definitely have saved a ton of painful events leading up to it.  And I do believe, whole-heartedly, that this book has (and will continue to) save many many marriages.  I will require any future suitor to read For Men Only before getting serious.  I have purchased "For Young Women Only" and "For Young Men Only" to read and determine if it's something suitable for my daughter, nieces & nephews.  I believe in this book so much that I decided to purchase each book (men & women's version) for every female friend I have (and her significant other) and for all three of my brothers.  That was quite an expensive investment in their future's, but I believe in these books that much.  While in the process of ordering 11 copies of both books, I came across "For Couples Only" and saved myself a LOT of $$$$$!!  "For Couples Only" is a boxed set of "For Women Only" and "For Men Only" and (according to reviews) a discussion guide.  At this time it costs close to $2 more than ONE of the single books.  Go here:  For Couples Only: Eyeopening Insights about How the Opposite Sex Thinks -- and trust me ladies, when you read "For Women Only" you are going to want to sneak a look at the one written for men!  I purchased them both, I read them both.  I am a woman.  My personal recommendation?  Stick to your own book and work on it.  Give your man time to process his.  Don't try to talk to him about it.  Just observe any changes he makes through time.  If you read his book, you will probably regret it (I did).  Here's to saving marriages and relationships *cheers*  After reading the adult books, consider these books for the teens in your life: For Young Women Only: What You Need to Know About How Guys Think, For Young Men Only: A Guy's Guide to the Alien Gender
