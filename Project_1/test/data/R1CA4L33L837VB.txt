It is pure pleasure to read any Greg Iles novel.  His beautiful prose enhances the intriguing plot with sharp and insightful narrative. Once again Iles has penned a winner with "The Footprints Of God". Dr David Tennant is appointed by the President as an ethics advisor to oversee Project Trinity, the creation of an artificial intelligence computer. When his good friend and associate on the project dies under suspicious circumstances David turns to his psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss. She is at first skeptical until an attempt to murder Rachel and David ends with the killing of another government agent. Soon the two are embroiled in a life or death search for proof of evil doings at Trinity before the world is held hostage by the entity it has created.In addition to a suspense filled thriller Iles has given the reader much to think about.  His well crafted dialogues entice the reader to consider whether there can be such a thing as artificial intelligence and if so if it will it outpace its creators. He also delves into the origins of religious belief and its relation to the creation of intelligent life on earth. I found myself reading late into the night and wishing for more when I finished.  Don't miss this one!
