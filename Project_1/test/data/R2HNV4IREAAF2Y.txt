I bought another Kingston 16G USB, the DataTraveler 100[...]_product and I gave it 4 star review because of the design of the cap and I was right. My DataTraveler USB is still functioning but it was bended due to the heat from USB gates and now unable to withdraw/pull the head of USB in. I guess that it will stop working due to physical damage very soon, that's why I looked for another 16G USB.This DT101 G2 seems to be a good choice. It is smaller than the DT 100. The cap is simple and effective and durable. I used it to back up about 11G of data and it works fine. The price is also good, only $23 from Amazon.As my observation, USB products has kind of wave price periods. A few months ago, it was impossible to find a 16G USB under $32, but now, it ranges around $20-$25. I guess this is a good time to buy a high volume USB like this one. I think that the price will increase more and more in the future.
