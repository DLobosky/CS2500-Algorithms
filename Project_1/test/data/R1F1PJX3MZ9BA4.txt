Clarke has been making pennywhistles since the mid-19th century, so they have plenty of experience.  This instrument--while obviously costing much more than a penny--plays very easily and projects well, especially in the upper register.  The only real concern that I have is that the untreated wood block might swell up when playing for a long time, or that it might change shape slightly over time.  The Clarke Celtic Tin Whistle, which I will review separately, is also a nice alternative.  The advantages to the Celtic Tin Whistle are (1) the plastic mouthpiece should be impervious to changes as a result of moisture, and (2) it actually projects a little better in the lowest octave.  I've owned one of Clarke's MEG pennywhistles for some time, and it is also a workable instrument.  The intonation on the Pennywhistle in D, though, is better than on either of the Clarke instruments with the plastic mouthpieces.  This seems to be because this instrument has an optimal volume at which the tone and the intonation are best.  So, what you lose in flexibility and projection, you gain in ease of tuning.  One other thing:  the black finish on the Pennywhistle in D is quite nice and distinctive.  In conclusion:  you can't go wrong with this instrument, but if you are concerned about the wood block over the long term, the Celtic Tin Whistle is a great alternative.
