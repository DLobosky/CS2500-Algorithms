Famous for directing classics such as "The Last of the Mohicans" (1920) and working with fledgling movie studios in America during the 1910s, his smooth, sophisticated style stands out from those of his contemporaries.  Not only was he one of the first great masters of the `narrative film', but his artistic flair is reflected in beautiful sets and designs, quickly making him one of America's most famous directors alongside D.W. Griffith, Cecil B DeMille and Thomas Ince.   This unique aesthetic touch makes his films of the 1910s appear to be much farther advanced in cinematography, thereby making this 1915 version of "Trilby" as entertaining and enjoyable to watch as a film of the mid or late 1920s.Based on a French story of the late 19th century in the gothic horror genre which was popular at the time, "Trilby" is part romance and part chilling suspense, revealing the subtle nature of early horror films, namely a strange man from the mysterious East who has extraordinary mental powers and abilities bordering on the supernatural.  The mystique of such people from India and similar places were fascinating and exciting to Western audiences at the turn of last century, but the story of "Trilby" is just as interesting in our day.   The mysterious stranger, known as "Svengali", sees an opportunity for wealth and fame by controlling a young woman with the power of his mind so that she becomes like a mindless puppet, doing his will and becoming a great diva all through his special powers.  But before she falls completely under his spell, she becomes engaged to be married, and the young groom is heartbroken by the sudden disappearance of his bride, and later sees her perform on stage while under Svengali's spell.  Famous silent screen actress, Clara Kimball Young, plays the role of Trilby perfectly with a balance of girlish energy and charm, and appropriate pantomime to convey the state of complete hypnotic control she falls under at the hands of Svengali.  So popular was this story in the early part of the 1900s that it was remade as a sound film in the 1930s with the focus on the enigmatic Svengali, in which John Barrymore gives a brilliant performance in the movie simply entitled "Svengali".This version by Alpha Home Entertainment has an introduction to the film, its stars and director, and a classical music soundtrack that does not always fit the scenes.  Furthermore, the picture quality is a little poor, with faces often appearing too white, general blurring and frequent flickering.  It is still a reasonable standard for a budget label like this, but to enjoy this film as it was originally meant to be seen, I recommend the version by the Reelclassicdvd label, also available on amazon.com.  This version has much clearer picture quality, some tinting, and a piano score made to suit the film.
