I've had this for a couple of months now, and I have to say it's the best, most logical and easy to set-up universal remote I've ever used. I also just sort of stumbled upon an Amazon sale which had it on sale for $128 which I couldn't turn down. I doubt I would have ever paid the normal $250 for it.For comparison, I had a Pronto, which I liked, but it was tedious at best to program and my wife could never master the macro-button driven logic that it uses.The 880 was a breeze to program. You plug it in to your computer, go the harmony web-site, tell it what and how you use your devices, and it does the rest. Everything worked perfectly for me the first try except for one issue with video switching on my TV for the XBox 360. I still haven't been able to correct that. No amount of delay has helped, so I'm kind of at a loss, there, but it's not really that big of a deal. The "help" menu asks if everything is working, I say "no" and the first thing it does is switch to the correct video input. Even with the extra step to correct things, it still beats using 5 or 6 different remotes.The one thing that makes the Harmony so user friendly is also the one thing that annoys my wife the most. You can't just walk by the TV and turn it on or it confuses the remote. The remote remembers whatever state things were last left in, so if you manually change anything the remote doesn't know about it, and it assumes things are as it last set them. This can lead to mass confusion when later trying to use the remote and having things shut off, or on, that you don't want. So, the key is to remember to ALWAYS USE THE HARMONY FOR EVERYTHING or the whole thing will get out of whack. I don't have much problem with that, but our TV is very easy to walk past and turn on, or off, or change inputs, so it takes a concerted effort to NOT do that.All in all, I think this is the easiest and best solution to most home theater needs. Some of the more sophisticated receiver functions have to be programmed in seperately the old-fashioned way (i.e. head-to-head IR copying from another remote), but it does a good job  overall with it's on-line database of remote codes. I was able to do every major function of my entire system the first time I programmed it.
