However when we tried using Netflix or any other streaming content the video or audio would constantly drop out. Within a few days it got worse and worse.  We tried switching to wired Internet, switching out HDMI cables, etc.  After some trial and error we removed the receiver from our setup and netflix worked. We called Samsung several times, and their customer service was the worst we've ever experienced.  We were hung up on repeatedly and spent over five hours on the phone. They only would let us send in the unit for repair - which would take 3-6 weeks on a receiver that was 2 weeks old.  They refused to stand by their products or issue a new unit.  After a lot of frustration, we called amazon, who overnighted us a new one with a 5 minute phone call.  (We are Prime customers.) As for the receiver, now that we have a working unit I am satisfied with the sound. I am not a big audiophile so I can't get overly specific, but movies sound great in our 18x15 living room.  We feel that the sound could be a little richer and robust  - but the speakers are tiny and we realize a home theatre in a box isn't going to have the sound quality of a more expensive custom system. For movies it's great, for music we notice its limitations. New unit has worked great but we have only had it a month. Now the blu-ray player won't power up as of this morning. It's 2 months old. Samsung is again refusing to stand by their products. Build quality on these components is abysmal, support is non-existant, and customer service is horrible.  Based on this I don't recommend this product. Our Labor Day weekend is going to be spent fighting with Samsung on the phone instead of watching blu-ray DVDs.  I am just praying the TV doesn't break next.We are in our 30's, very tech savvy, and don't have kids.  So this isn't simply user error or the kids breaking the unit.  I am just amazed at how bad the build quality is.  My boyfriend just got off the phone with Amazon, they will replace the blu-ray too.  Thank you Amazon for standing by what you sell even when the manufacturer won't. Samsung could learn a lot from your customer service.
