I wish I could use this one on my bike.  I've installed these on my kid's bikes though, and both now have excellent rear view capability.The only criticism is the design of the clamp used to affix these to the handlebar.  These will need to be shugged up a couple of times until the bracket doesn't flex anymore.  When finally snug against the bar, the mirror adjusts easily providing excellent rear view.
