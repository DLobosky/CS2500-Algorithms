I have been using the Coby earphones ($5) for a year now and I've gotten tired of changing them every 3-6months. So after my 3rd Coby gave out, I decided to try the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds ($10).Side by Side Comparison :Look : JBuds look  almost identical to the Coby's but they have 2 more extra earpieces (small & large). The cord is a little flimsy (no complaints here since these are cheap) but the part where the cord connects to the jack looks very vulnerable and soft. If the earpieces get snagged (which happens with me a lot of times), I feel this part would give out. THe Coby's jack is L-shaped so if the wires get snagged, it takes a little stress off the jack/cord connection.Sound : I tested both earphones side by side and the difference is big. Jbuds did give a clear crisp sound but lacks the Bass sound which makes the sound fuller. Coby's has good Treble & Bass ranges and you can even hear the tiniest sound (from shakers or maracas or tambourines). IN some acoustic songs, the Jbuds lost the tiny background sounds (tambourines, etc as mentioned). I'm particular of those small background instruments since they give the song "that feeling." I tested both on acoustic, hiphop, RnB, rock, dance, trance songs and the Cobys sound better hands down. Dance tracks & HIphop where the bass is more prominent sounds better with the Cobys.Bottom line : If you want better sound (and can handle changing your earbuds every 3-6 months (The last one I have lasted 6mo. and all 3 Cobys lost sound on one side only) go for the COBYs. The Cobys sound so good that I still keep the old ones, cut-off the non-functioning side, & use it while sleeping. :) If you want an ok sound, go with the Jbuds since I read they have a 1-year warranty (without shipping charge) so your money is safe for a year.
