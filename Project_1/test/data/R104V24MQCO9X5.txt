This chronicle of those who chronicled the minute by minute horror of September 11. 2001 gives the reader a contemporaneous view of the day and, in their own words, of how reporters report.  It starts with the recollection of WPIX-TV, New York Helicopter Cameraman Chet Wilson:"The morning was crystal clear and visibility stretched to the horizon. The Twin Towers loomed over Lower Manhattan as the sun came up. The morning rays bathed them in crimson.  Their long shadows reached across the river to Liberty State Park in New Jersey like a gigantic sundial.  WB11's news helicopter was transmitting its normal segments for the morning show.  ..." It ends with a very tired Dan Rather, Anchor, CBS News: "I got home at five-fifteen in the morning. I know from past experience that you can't just have a glass of milk and go to bed.  There's always a long glide down.  My head was too full.  And I needed to be back at the office at nine the next morning. ..."In between we see the human side of those trying to tell a stricken world what has happened, what is happening, and what will happen.  They are like those blind people with the elephant - all each can do is report on the little piece of the beast in front of him.The book is a cooperative humanitarian compilation, royalties are being donated to benefit the families of the victims of the September 11 terrorists attacks, including  the families of the six broadcast engineers who died that day atop the World Trade Center, who are touchingly eulogized in the book's Epilogue.Here is how the editors explain the effort:  "We took the individual accounts of what journalists experienced, learned, and felt that day and wove them into a narrative. The major events are discussed in the order in which they occurred."  The reader who would like to follow each contributor through his/her day may do so by using the Index of Contributors in the back of the book.  Also in the back of the book are helpful maps of the besieged areas, (which I wish I would have known while I was reading the book - instead of stumbling upon them afterward) and picture bio/blurbs of the contributors.  Conspicuously absent here are Bryant Gumble, Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Diane Sawyer, and Charlie Gibson.  Jane Clayson participated, as did all the major network news anchors.  Byron Pitts, CBS News Correspondent, New York, summarized The Day:  "On September 11 in Lower Manhattan, everyone was just a human being. People weren't black; they weren't white; they weren't cops; they weren't firefighters; they were just human beings. I don't remember anyone yelling at anyone, anyone giving directions to do anything.  I will remember September 11 as much for what went right as for what went wrong: the bravery of the firefighters, how incredibly decent people were. I was raised to believe that  God is good.  I believed it on September 10. I believed it on September 11.  The evil that happened there - that was man-made.  But the strength and the decency, the courage people showed, for me, that's what God and faith  are all about.  And I was reminded that tomorrow isn't promised."
