I have used colloidal silver for many things. I usually buy Sovereign Silver brand. The last bottle I ordered of it had a broken dropper (they have a glass dropper). I decided to try Source Naturals brand as it has good reviews, and price per ounce is comparable...Well, I got it in, and when I opened and went to use it, I noticed that it is a dark yellow gold color...looks rusty almost...Well, I thought maybe that is not unusual, maybe it is just the brand...as Sovereign Silver is always clear, looks like water. I did some research, and found that colloidal silver really should be clear, any color is a sign of an inferior product. Now inferior does not necessarily mean bad for you...but I didn't want to take the chance. I sent it back and re-ordered Sovereign Silver brand...It came in today, I opened it and it is clear as a bell. So, for me, I will be sticking with Sovereign Silver brand.
