If you are a Dodgers fan, then this set is a must own.  It has every game of the 1988 World Series which chornicles their improbable run to the club's six and final World Series title with their stunning five game victory over the heavily favored Oakland A's.  It also includes games five and seven from their equally stunning upset of the heavily favored New York Mets.  The '88 series is best remembered for Kirk Gibson's bottom of the ninth, two out home run off of Dennis Eckersley that is one of the most memorable moments in baseball history.  While the image of an injured Gibson hobbling around the bases pumping his fists is an iconic image, it was his only apperance of the entire series.  It was ace pitcher Orel Hershiser that was the true star of the series.  Pitching twice and throwing two complete games, he pitched a shut-out in game two and gave up a mere two runs in the clinching game five.
