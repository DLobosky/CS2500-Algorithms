&quot;Who's Next&quot; was released in 1971. This album is very different  from the Who's work on the compilation &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and  Bouncy.&quot; &quot;Who's Next&quot; is a more mature album, but it still  contains all of the energy and intensity of the Who's earlier work. It's  hard for me to say which of those two albums is better. However, it is  clear to me that both of them are an essential part of any rock and roll  collection. Both are among my 25 favorite albums of all time.&quot;Who's  Next&quot; is a perfect album. Every song is excellent.  I think that this  album sounds so different from the Who's earlier work that it almost sounds  as if they are a different band. But that just shows that the band was able  to come up with new concepts, ideas, song structures, and melodies. It  doesn't mean that they became better, and it doesn't mean that they became  worse. Really, I think that in order to understand the Who, you need to  have &quot;Who's Next&quot; and &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and  Bouncy.&quot;Pete Townsend was one of the two greatest synthesizer  artists of the 1970s (the other being Stevie Wonder). The synth work on  &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; is perhaps the best use of the machine  that has ever been used in the history of rock. The way the synth pulls and  tugs, and changes in pitch and volume, it almost sounds as if it was a  living thing.&quot;Bargain&quot; is one of the greatest love songs ever  written. I guess in 1971 a lot of people must have been pretty surprised to  hear the Who writing a song about love. But don't think the song is wimpy.  This song has just as much intensity as anything else that they have ever  done. Physically, the song is somewhat mellow compared to their other  songs, but the intensity of the feelings that are present is just as strong  and intense as anything else that they have ever done. When this guy tells  the girl that he is in love with her, he sounds totally  believable.&quot;My Wife&quot; is, admittedly, somewhat sexist in  nature, but only a politically correct wacko would find it offensive. Heh  heh. Gotta watch out for those psycho women that go after you. Perhaps the  song was intended as a joke? I don't know.&quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; is a  song about the feelings of youth and anger and alienation and depression,  and about how sometimes it feels as if you are all alone and nobody  understands you. This is a great song, full of understanding and  compassion. Some people say that rock music has a bad influence on  teenagers, but the way I see it, teenagers need to hear this song. This  song lets you know that you are not the only one who feels the way that you  do. Who knows, maybe hearing this song could be enough to encourage a  suicidal teenager to change his mind?A lot of the songs on this album go  against the conventional, 3 minute song structure that was common at the  time. This helps to give added dimension and personality to the songs.  &quot;Who's Next&quot; is one of the best examples that I can think of of  the idea of an album being a concept. Each individual song is excellent,  but the album as a whole may very well be better than the sum of its  individual parts.&quot;Who's Next&quot; is a a great album. But don't be  one of those people who buys only this. Get &quot;Who's Next,&quot; but  also get &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy.&quot; In order to really  understand what the Who was about, you need to have both of those albums.
