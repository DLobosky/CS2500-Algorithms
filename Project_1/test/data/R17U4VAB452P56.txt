I had heard the S220 on a computer at work and thought it sounded pretty good, but on my son's computer the bass is a little muddy and strained.  To be fair, for the price the Logitech unit is a great deal.  But the CA-3602 was only about $10 more and I would get it in the future.  The only downside I see compared to the S220 is the size of the subwoofer, which is much larger on this speaker set.As for the Cyber Acoustics CA-3602, it is all about price/performance.  This is not an audiophile system, but it does sound pretty good and at the price (under forty bucks when I bought it) you really can't beat it.  The high end and midrange is very good and very crisp, a bit tinny but not bad for the price.  The bass is plentiful, although a bit boomy and imprecise, but again it is price/performance here and for $40 it is an astonishingly good sounding system.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to most computer users.  The exceptions would be if you are a true audiophile and using your computer to listen to music, or if you are a gamer and need a 5.1 or 7.1 system, in which cases you should be spending way more than this set costs.In the end, I'd easily recommend this for a large percentage of computer users out there looking for a good sounding system at a nice reasonable price.
