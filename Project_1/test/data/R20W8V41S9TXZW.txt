I purchased this hoodie as a gift. He loved it. I purchased a xl, Because of the other review, The size was actually a large. I say its one size smaller then your size. The leather is nice not stiff.The red is not that bright. If you ever brought Sean John Stuff , you will know that if it appears bright its the photo. This is really a wine. Overall great quality. But its not as thick as a fleece hoodie, but not cheap at all. Overall a great product . will get more for Xmas presents, before all gone
