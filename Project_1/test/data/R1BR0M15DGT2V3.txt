This is an amazing swimsuit.  The print is very pretty with beautiful vibrant shades of blue.  The attached bottom is in wonderful, basic black, which is very flattering.  The halter and soft, comfortable bra cups are well made and will not come undone even while diving.  It wears very well and has not faded over the summer.  The material is exquisite because it provides the perfect amount of stretch, without ever over-stretching. The skirt is another award winning feature of this suit.  As the other reviewer mentioned, it honestly does flutter at just the perfect length to hide the very upper part of the thigh, which can often be the "dimple problem area!"  The middle of the suit has beautiful, soft folds which is another torso slenderizing feature.  There is a small peek-a-boo cutout on the bodice which provides a nice touch, without showing anything it shouldn't!  I loved this suit enough, I just ordered another one in the shades of orange.  I would highly suggest buying this suit.  I can't imagine you won't be delighted.
