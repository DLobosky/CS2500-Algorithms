I researched the net and tried every tip I could find but was only able to get it to keep a connection for at most 30 mins.  I don't have any interference and live on a 2 acre plot. Since I use the slingbox on my laptop a lot, the disconnects were unacceptable to me.  I eventually had to return the DIR-655 back to Amazon and I have just received the TrendNet TEW-633GR instead.  This model is almost identical to the DIR-655 and so far after 2 hours, I have not had a connection drop with the TEW-633.  I'll update if I notice any changes.
