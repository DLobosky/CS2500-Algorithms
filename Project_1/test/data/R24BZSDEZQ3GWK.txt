If you like Shannon McKenna, you should like this.Sexual content:  not evaluated.  I read this book before I began counting sex scenes and describing the language.  As I recall, it was probably strong.  Setting: current day U.S.  Copyright: 2005.  Genre: romantic suspense.As of 6/14/08, I've read 6 Lucy Monroe books, as follows.5 stars.  Ready.
