There are some that are sad, some that are inspirational and some that are cute!  They involve all sorts of breeds and ages of dogs and it is great to see how the dogs changed their owners lives.  If I can appreciate this book as a non-dog lover than an actual dog lover would really love this book!  It is a great book to read a story or more and then pick up anytime.  Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent a sample to review in exchange for my honest opinion.
