You'll probably be wanting to round up some lighter fluid and set the disc on fire from frustration. I just finished watching Absentia and must say I was quite disappointed by it after having read all of the glowing reviews on the net. Don't be fooled! This is a slowwwwwww moving movie. There where times when I wanted to turn it off because of boredom. Pretty much nothing happens for the first hour except character development. Not much happens in the last half hour of the movie either, which is when things are supposed to be climactic. You catch a few shadowy glimpses of "some" creature. You get to see plenty of shots of a tunnel(where the creature resides) from a distance and up close. The ending is extremely lame, even for low budget films. They had all this buildup through the film, but unfortunately there was no payoff at the end.I guess what saves this movie from me giving it a one star rating is the acting. More specifically, the emotional trauma played between the two main characters. That's the best thing about this low budget independent horror film. Which is nice to see since most independent horror flicks have pretty bad acting. There's not really many "main actors" but the handful there is does a darn good job. My problems(BIG) with this film is that it's a creature film with no creatures we ever see. It briefly hints/tells what kind of creature it is, but never really reveals it(only in shadows and then you know kind of what it is but not what it looks like). In other words, the where attempting quiet horror over shock horror and failed. The tunnel I mentioned earlier is never explored once the pieces of the puzzle is put together. How creepy and scary would that have been to go in the lair of the creature and see it and it's victims housed in there? Very, I do believe.Nothing about this movie was suspenseful or scary. At all. Which is why I'm baffled at all the glowing reviews. Maybe if you like your horror movies of the quiet variety where the monsters are never revealed in the "flesh" and you can use your imagination to fill in the gaps(BIG), then this may be your cup of tea and I could maybe see someone giving it 3.5 stars. But 5 stars! Some of the statements other reviewer made about how great this movie is are a bit ludicrous. Such as going to so far to say this is the best independent horror film in a decade or so. Yeah. Right.A character driven movie with no suspense or scares to speak of all in the vain of quiet horror that's supposed to unsettle you with the unseen. Sorry not here folks. Everyone has differrent opinions but I don't see how anyone can call this a great(or even good horror flim) and say it's frightening or scary. Don't get me wrong. I like quiet ghostly horror movies. When they are effective. Sadly most of them aren't, especially those in the world of low budget films. I probably would have given this movie 3 stars if they had shown the creature and it's lair and victims a time or two. I'm not saying it had to jump out and start ripping people limb from limb. Violent or not, I wanted it effective and chilling. What I am saying is why make a creature flick if you're not going to show the creature and use it in nasty and disturving ways? Seems pointless not to. Skip this one and find something else to rent. I say 2 stars out of 5 or a 4 out of 10. Not the worst I've seen, but also a longgggg way from being the best I've seen.
