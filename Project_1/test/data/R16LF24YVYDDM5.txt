First you have to like this sort of game and have the patience to play it.  Then you have to like variety.  You can not only chose the type of tiles (fantasy, cultures, children's) but also which layout you want to you.  There are dozens and dozens of combinations to chose from.  If you win, then you see a little animation that fits with the type of tiles you've played with. Its a relaxing game that you don't even need to be skilled at -- you can always use the "find match" button if you need help.
