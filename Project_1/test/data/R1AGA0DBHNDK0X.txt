They are very tough and durable.  On a recent trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, I even used it submerged to look for a fellow camper's eyeglasses that had fallen into the lake.  While it is not designed for underwater use (being only water resistant), the lamp performed flawlessly.While nearly perfect, I will recommend picking up the accessory pack available for the AA Mini Mag Lite.  The accessory pack includes a rubber cover for the lens end that helps prevent the lamp from rolling and also absorbs some impact if dropped.  It also includes a wrist strap with a split ring so you can keep it close at hand (I usually put the strap around my wrist when I slide into my sleeping bag--if I need to get up quickly during the night, the lamp is always at hand).  The accessory pack also includes three plastic lenses--blue, red, and clear (the product description lists an amber lens in palce of the clear one).  I've found the red one useful when I want to rummage through a pack when my tentmate has already turned in for the night.  It gives you illumination that is not as harsh as the non-filtered white light.
