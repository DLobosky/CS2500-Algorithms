The second season of Soap is about as funny as the first season. Pretty much all the same characters returned (with a few new characters) in the continuting story of two sisters: Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell. The excellent cast once again provided big laughs in every episode (just as in season 1). But one major cast member would famously depart after season 2. Robert Guillaume, who stole scene after scene in his role as Benson, left after the second season of Soap to go on to his own spin-off show Benson (which was a good show, though not as good as Soap). Just as Benson made its debut in 1979, Guillaume won Soap's first acting Emmy (Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series). That was a well-deserved honor and a wonderful way to go out. It'll be interesting to see how seasons 3 and 4 of Soap play out without Benson. Nevertheless, I'll be looking forward to those last two seasons.
