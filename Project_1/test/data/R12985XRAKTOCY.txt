Although that 'paranormal romance' on the spine is a bit misleading, which may be what they were responding to. This is much heavier on the paranormal than on the romance bit. In fact, the romance between Lily & Rule is pretty much a given, and it's just a matter of them adjusting to it. The story is more about Lily being attacked by a demon, and About the nature of identity. There's also more of Cullen, from the first book, and an introduction of Cynna, who I think will end up with him, from the sparks they strike off each other. I LOVE this series, and think it's one of the best of the several new paranormal series I've read. Can't wait for the next one.
