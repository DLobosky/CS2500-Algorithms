I actually bought the red one. The black one has better reviews here but it's the exact same unit so you should be aware. It is reasonably fast. I was surprised as I didn't expect much at this price. But I agree with other reviewers (of the red one), this is made very cheaply. Mine was not at all accurate when I tested it. The biggest problem is the plastic body easily falls apart and the battery cover will fall out. $9 isn't much for a fast digital thermometer but it is probably wasted money if it will fall apart as fast as this one. I wouldn't want plastic or worse yet, a battery, in my food. I also thought the digits are a little small - harder to read than some other models. I would spend more to get better quality, speed and bigger numbers.
