This latest Harry Dresden book is great.  While it isn't hugely different from previous books (same basic theme), it avoids the usual sequel problems (e.g., too much carryover from previous books drowns reader in boring details, no real ending to the story just plod along on a giant plotline).  "Small Favors" has a good rise & fall of plot, introduces new ideas, and the overall writing has been steadily improving over the series.  Overall, I must say I'm impressed, and I really enjoyed reading it.
