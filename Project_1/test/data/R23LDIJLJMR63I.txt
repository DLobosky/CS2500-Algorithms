You won't find entries on fantasy characters - no Bilbo, no Thomas Covenant - and only a few of the most common kinds of fantastic creatures (like dragons).  You won't find endless pages of geeky details about Tolkien; you won't find Harry Potter at all (the books had only begun to be published when this encyclopedia was last updated).  So be aware of what this is NOT before you make an effort to get it - several other reviewers apparently expected something quite different.What you WILL get though is the best reference work covering the major authors, books, films, countries with fantasy writing traditions, comics, magazines, and themes and concepts in the field.  The authors have said that it will not be updated in print again -- it will be online only. That's a shame for paper-lovers like me; I cannot tell you how many hours I have spent in the company of this, paging back and forth between entries. Sure, clicking through a website is easier in some ways, but thus far that hasn't materialized. Virtually every writer and novel that I've ever heard of that could be considered part of the genre is in here; the authors seem to have missed nothing.  People like Tolkien, Peake, Dunsany not surprisingly receive several page entries apiece, but it's rare to find any figure at all - at least any writing in English, I think the coverage outside of the language is a bit sparser - who doesn't get a fairly thorough bibliographic listing at the least.You can probably get both this and its science fiction companion quite cheap now, and I would highly recommend them if you have any interest in the byways of the fields. One thing I really like is that neither book discriminates against the more "literary" figures (Angela Carter, Salman Rushdie, etc) who sometimes are given short shrift in genre-geeky references. The writing is generally serious, and I like the fact that "objectivity" isn't always the highest goal; no matter how popular a book or author may be, Clute et al are not afraid to cut them down to size, though never maliciously.  And on the other hand they always seem to find something nice to say about even more marginal figures in the field (e.g., Dennis McKiernan).  They are in short enthusiastic supporters of the genre as a whole, and I can't think of many writers who have done half as well at grasping the enormity of this gigantic and wonderful field of literature.
