From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.The Dover Thrift Edition provides quality reading at a rock bottom price.  Inexpensive, but not cheap!
