I totally agree with all the other reviewers, especially the review from....&iexcl;¨ Indeed, it is criminal for Disney to hold such great films as Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Pon Poko in their possession and not share them with the people in the States. If I were the head of the Disney, I&iexcl;¦ll fire their marketing people at once, because they have no vision.Me too, I've gotten the Castle in the Sky on DVD from Japan Town long time ago. And I think I know why the Disney does not release it until now. Because the Atlantis and the Treasure Island (the wannabes of the Castle in the Sky) were big failures and box office luck busters, and the Spirited Away has claimed a huge critical and monetary success. Now they finally open their short-sighted eyes, knowing they have the real gems, which are far much better their own bad copycat products and try to tag along with Miyazaki&iexcl;¦s master pieces after all that. How Shameless
