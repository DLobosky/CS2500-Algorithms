The author's mother abandoned her Jewish family after having become pregnant by a con man, never contacted her family again after she abandoned them except to ask them for money, never went to see her mother even as the mother lay dying in a hospital a quick train ride away. She married a black man, converted to Christianity and then spent a lifetime concealing information about her past from her children.  When one son, a sometime-reporter, decided that her story would make a good book, he took down uncritically a completely unbelievable story about a miserly, money-hungry, child-abusing, wife-abusing, violent rabbi father, someone who seems to have stepped off the pages of a medieval anti-Semitic tract. The Jewish family life described in this book comes right out of the pages of the "Jew of Malta," complete with bloodthirsty and barbaric rituals, mindless rules, usury, and hatred of others.  The son made no effort to contact his living extensive Jewish family, including his aunt or many living cousins who might have cast any doubt on his mother's story. Given that even to the casual reader it is apparent that the mother's tale is a carefully constructed rationalization and justification of her own decision to cut all family ties, the son's uncritical acceptance of this fable is shocking.  The author's attempt to undercut the obvious anti-Semitism in the book by stating that some of his best friends are Jewish and that his mother sees a "wonderful Jewish heart doctor" makes this even more sickening, as does his bragging that due to his efforts his mother has become one of the "most inspirational figures in contemporary American literature." McBride's use of the word "literature" to describe his efforts is actually very telling, since the dictionary definition of "literature" is "imaginative or creative writing." The reader should take this as a work of fiction until proven otherwise.
