Covey has written a seminal book about business and self help that has gravitated into the general publics consciousness. 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is not a magical fix all to your problems and it doesn't advertise itself to be. I confess I'm guilty of coveting the material things of life...the cars, television, books, etc. and Steven Covey presents a very sobering look at what one can do to change themselves and live a fulfilled life without having to disown modernity. Any meaningful change has to occur from the inside out because if your miserable person inside nothing is going to change that misery. Every end has to have a beginning and if we begin with the end in mind, we'll know where we are going and take the necessary steps to get there. First things first, do the simple little steps towards goals rather than the big broad sweeping goal. Think win-win, life isn't a zero sum game...we all have skills to offer each other. The advice offered seems so simple when one thinks about it, but in the rush of todays world, its' often forgotten.
