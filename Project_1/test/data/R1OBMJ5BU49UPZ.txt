Flash has had several reprints of the Alex Ramond work on the strip (I have volumes from 3 different publishers).  But Buck never got this.  For years the only sampling of BR strips were the Chelsea House hardbacks.  My aunt had a copy at her house, and when I visited, I pulled it out and read thru the the strips.  Later, I was able to get my own copy, but found it was the revised edition they came out with, where they dropped a lot of the strips, but did add some from George Tuska's work.  The CH collection was frustrating.  Yes, they reprinted a lot of good storylines, but some were left incomplete (like the 2 Sunday storylines they reprinted).Now, Hermes is working on reprinting all the Dailies and Sundays.  As the Sundays had a totally different storyline (the first few years didn't even have Buck, but starred Wilma's kid brother), they will be collected in a separate set of books.This volume reprints the first 5 storylines, and sets the groundwork for future storylines.I hope that these sell well, because there are issues for modern readers.Let's be honest.  The artwork isn't as slick and polished as most would expect from comic strips.  And the writting doesn't help.  You have to wince and roll your eyes on some of the writing.  And there are other issues.  Buck awakes in a world were America has been devistated and taken over by the "Red Monguls", who conquered the world with their superscience of repeller rays and destructor rays.  This is typical early 20th century 'Yellow Peril' fears.  Thankfully, Buck is able to help the Americans throw off the yoke of the Monguls and make peace with the Supreme Mogul.  But even at the end of the book, most of America is apparently still under Mongul control.  "Free America" is basically the Eastern part of the US along with Canada, with their capital at Niagra.  A new foe appears in the form of the Tigermen of Mars, who will be the main villians for many years.  The implied racism is troublesome, tho the Americans do make peace with the Asians; we see nothing about black americans or what's going on in Europe or Africa.Wilma is also not the independent and strong woman of the 25th century we would like and expect.  Too much of the storylines turn on her jealousys of Buck being with other girls (when nothing happened) or misunderstanding something and going off in a huff.The 'high tech' of the 25th century is too much what someone in the 1920s thought it might be.  No computers, no jets.  Aircraft are either biplanes or rocket ships or repeller dirigibles.  No ray guns, but guns shooting explosive bullets.I know that artwork and writing improve, so I hope this series sells well enough.  And can't wait for the Sundays.  Hermes Press has already announced the next 2 dailies books and well as the first Sunday volume.
