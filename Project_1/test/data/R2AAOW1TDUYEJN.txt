This is a no frills, no fuss workout. The setting is a lovely ocean view with two exercisers and the instructor Jaime Brenkus. Jaime Brenkus has a friendly, approach with just the right touch of enthusiasm. He leads you through 8 minutes of exercises designed to work different parts of your abdominal muscles. Each set of movements like oblique twists and reverse curls are 45 seconds long. A small bell rings when each set is done. Brenkus then takes you into the next set. A timer at the bottom of the screen tracks your progress till you have completed the full 8 minutes. There is no warm up or cool down. Just 8 minutes of straight abdominals. I really love the tape. It's handy to tack on to the end of another workout when you are already warmed up or warm up yourself and use alone. It's hard to find an ab tape that is short and efficient, where you don't have to fast forward through a lot of tape you don't need. I also like the one on one style Jaime demonstrates. The timer is motivating too. The one drawback is that Jaime does not explain to the viewer correct abdominal postioning to get maximum benefits from ab work. This makes a big difference in results. But if you already know this information and want a quick workout I highly recommend it!
