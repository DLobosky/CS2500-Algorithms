&quot;The Scarlet Claw&quot; (aka: &quot;Sherlock Holmes And The Scarlet Claw&quot;) was made in 1944, and represents the 8th Sherlock film in the fourteen-movie series starring the ever-pleasing duo of Basil Rathbone as Mr. Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John H. Watson. This is most certainly one of the better films in the Rathbone/Bruce franchise of Sherlock flicks -- a successful and entertaining franchise that began with the outstanding 1939 version of &quot;The Hound Of The Baskervilles&quot;, and ended with &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot; in 1946.&quot;The Scarlet Claw&quot; was one of three Sherlock Holmes' entries produced in the calendar year of 1944. Basil Rathbone was one busy Sherlock during this mid-'40s time period, cranking out yet another three Holmes' motion pictures the following year of 1945 as well.&quot;Claw&quot; exudes a feeling of tension and dread right from the very first scene. The viewer is reeled into the mysterious happenings immediately, as we wonder &quot;Who -- or What -- is ringing that church bell at this hour of the night?&quot;.  A very effective, and eerie, opening to the picture. Our favorite pipe-smoking detective from London's 221B Baker Street is soon called into this baffling case, which features murder victims being found with their throats torn open -- presumably caused by the elusive &quot;Monster of La Morte Rouge&quot;.The film conveys a realistic sense of the foggy, damp atmosphere that permeates the marshes surrounding the small village where these gruesome murders are taking place. This &quot;atmosphere&quot; is particularly powerful during the climactic scene at the end of the film. This DVD version of &quot;Claw&quot; comes via MPI Home Video, and displays nicely-restored video quality, thanks to the praise-worthy preservation efforts undertaken by the &quot;UCLA Film and Television Archive&quot;. This black-and-white Holmes' classic has most certainly never looked better on any home video format.The DVD's soundtrack is pleasing enough, although not completely free from all background &quot;crackle&quot;. It's a Dolby Digital 2-Channel Mono track used here, with no alternate-language track employed. This stand-alone, single-disc edition of &quot;The Scarlet Claw&quot; contains nothing but the film itself. No supplemental bonus features are present whatsoever. There's a simple static Main Menu, with just one lonely Sub-Menu (for the 11 Chapter Selections). Additional information concerning this DVD ...........................&gt;&gt; Video Aspect Ratio -- Full Frame (1.33:1), which is the original theatrical ratio.&gt;&gt; Audio -- DD 2.0 Mono (English only).&gt;&gt; Subtitles -- English.&gt;&gt; Running Time -- 74 minutes. (Which is actually one of the longest of the 14 Sherlock Holmes' films in this Rathbone-starring series. Generally, Basil's Holmes was required to wrap up the mystery and get his man in just a tad more than 60 minutes.)&gt;&gt; Insert Included? -- Yes. A one-sheet enclosure with Chapter List.------------------------In this reviewer's opinion, the immensely-likeable and ingeniously-cast tandem of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce shall forever represent the quintessential &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Doctor Watson&quot;.  &quot;The Scarlet Claw&quot; is a shining example of the twosome's appeal and talent. And these traits have never looked more visually alluring than on this beautifully-restored DVD from MPI Home Video.
