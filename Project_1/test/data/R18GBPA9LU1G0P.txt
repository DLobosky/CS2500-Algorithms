Eyehategod are there for you. I've gotten bored with overtly costumed Euro metal (Cradle, Dimmu Borgir, Children of Bodom) and growl-laden Death metal (everyone else). That's why Eyehategod is a revelation to me. No choral breaks or violins. No Cannibal Corpse-type grunting in front of anonymous blastbeats. Just pure aggression, but with such a slow groove that you're awaiting the release of Michael William's screams. From the opening scream and breaking glass of "My Name Is God (I Hate You)", these guys have you by the throat. No melody, no strict musical form, just the purity of a good riff and some shredded vocal cords. Feedback is used to its utmost. Eyehategod is so merciless with their audible limits, they make The Melvins sound like Electric Light Orchestra. They always manage to stay heavy, even when they never move above mid-tempo. I'm not too familiar with the "sludge" metal genre out of the South, but Eyehategod have become my heroes. Be warned - this isn't the kind of music you're gonna be able to turn people onto. "It sounds like it was recorded in a garage." "This guy just screams all the time." Screw 'em, it's good to have heaviness for its' own sake. Hold this CD tight, and it will take you through the darkness. Now, I updated to this remaster a little while ago - my old copy was played to death. I haven't had a good stereo to compare the sound quality, but given that it was recorded only 12 years ago and the kind of music it is, this version sounds great. The main thing you see on this is three more tracks - "Depress", "Peace Thru War (alt. version)" and the "Dopesick Jam" (my personal favorite). They are morsels added onto a already satisfying steak. My only complaint with this set is that with the restyling of the album art, the old photo under the CD tray is gone. That was a nice vintage bondage shot.Anyway, buy this album - it is GLORIOUSLY HEAVY! Play it in your car, and by the third track you'll be screaming into your windshield and running over children. Ah, what fun....
