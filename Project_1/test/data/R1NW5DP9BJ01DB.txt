I have a couple of other dance workouts with Marie...she's a great cuer!After the warmup, there's some isolations which I kind of felt that Prevention just stuck in there to lengthen out the workout.  I didn't find them to be necessary.I enjoyed both the Afro-Latin and Reggae segments, but I sure got confused when I added in the arm movements!  The choreography is a bit complicated and I'll have to do this one a couple more times to get it down.  I was glad to see different dance moves than the norm though...There's a LOT of twisting motions and more impact than usual.  Very tough to do on carpet unless you have dance shoes.  The impact can only be modified so much, so be prepared for a couple of hops here and there.Recommend to intermediates with a good background with dance videos....beginners to dance workouts will have a tough time.
