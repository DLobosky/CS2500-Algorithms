These Sony MDR-EX71SLA Fontopia headphones or more accurately, ear buds serve their purpose for me.  I normally use Sony's open-air ear buds but when there is a lot of ambient noise, like on an airplane or on a bus, these closed-type ear buds do an adequate job of "filtering" out most of the outside noise.  And it does it at a reasonable price- especially when compared to noise-canceling headphones.I do have a couple of complaints.  First of all, why is the white model is so much less expensive than the black?  In the end, I suppose that really doesn't matter.I don't particularly care for the offset cable design where the left cord to the ear bud is shorter than the right.  Maybe I just haven't adjusted to the difference but it does feel like the left cord will be more vulnerable to damage when the cord is accidentally yanked.  The more common Y-shaped cord would seem to take the strain more uniformly.I also don't understand why Sony chose to split the cord in two- a cord too short to be practical by itself and a really too long extension cord.  The connector alone really seems add a lot of weight to the cord.  It adds enough weight that it sometimes pulls the left ear bud out of my ear.Still, it is a good product.But for my money, I'd suggest getting the Sony MDR-EX51LP at a little lower price.
