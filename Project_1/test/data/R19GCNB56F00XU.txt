This show said more about the human condition -- and said it with more compassion, verve and style -- than any television show before or since. Aaron Sorkin's depiction of these facile, funny, earnest people sent tingles and gasps, giggles and tears through my body every Wednesday night. Never a sports fan until this show, I found myself feeling more alive when exposed to these characters, these people of good conscience doing their best to create something of value. There was none of the formulaic cynicism that mass media generally affords us. In its place was a genuine revelling in the human condition, faith in the basic goodness of we wonderfully flawed mortals, and more wit than television has ever seen. I am so grateful it was on the air.
