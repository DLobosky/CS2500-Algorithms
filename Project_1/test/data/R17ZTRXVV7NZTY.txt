But season 4 was far more complicated. Just as CTU seems to come to grips with one attack, it leads into something more sinister and larger than they had expected. The twists and turns just seem to keep coming, up through the very end. a very good season.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. There is also an option on the episode discs to view deleted or extended scenes in-line to the episode. Cool feature.Season 4 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and abonus features. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV or surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some "intense" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.
