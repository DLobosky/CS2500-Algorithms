The lack of widescreen or quality sound is really sad. In addition the lack of extras, there are none. There could have been so much like outakes, gallery stuff, behind the scenes, theatrical trailers, phot galleries, and maybe the Goofy short, "How to Ride a Horse". Oh well, they did a great job on other DVDs in the Vault Disney series so you hope for the same in others.MOVIE REVIEWThis is a great family film from the Disney Studio deserving of 5 stars. A fun adventure with Dean Jones, without as much slapstick as his other Disney outings. A little adventure, big dose of comedy, with some romance thrown in while a busy ad exec and single father has to learn to sort out his priorities. Jones plays an advertising executive that is stuck between an employer who is pressuring him to invent a jazzy new ad campaign for a bigshot client, while being a single parent of a daughter that desperatley wants a horse. He is not to keen on horses to begin with or the high cost of the riding instructions she is attending, or even the riding instructor. Of course the instructor (Diane Baker) feels his daughter is a fantastic rider and should compete in riding shows. He is strongly opposed to the extra cost and the letdown he fears his daughter will have if she does not win. Through a few nice plot twists, suddenly the 2 very different needs meet and he not only buys a horse but lets his daughter enter it in shows. But he really does it to promote an ad campaign and figures out a sneaky way to have his clients pay for it. Meanwhile his daughter develops a love interest in another horseman, a very young Kurt Russell. And Dad begins to fall for the instructor he hates. Dianne Baker and Dean Jones have a wonderful chemistry. This is a fun movie, and I highly reccommend the film, but you might as well buy the VHS version. It is cheaper, and the DVD has nothing that is not on the the tape.
