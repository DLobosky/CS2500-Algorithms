Using this helped mitigate the effects of the sun and has (over a month  and a half) made my hair about a shade lighter. For the life of me, I do not know which products are doing this since it does not list peroxide as an ingredient. Unfortunately, my hair is also a lot dryer and more brittle after using this shampoo (and the conditioner that goes with it). Most natural blondes tend to have thin hair shafts and suffer from more breakage than other hair colors. Because of this my hair appears more "frizzy" even though I rarely use heated styling tools.One great thing about this shampoo is it leaves almost no residue or greasy coasting on my hair. I generally wash my hair only every other day, and while it tends to get greasy on the second day it does last longer than other heavier shampoos I have tried.My advice is to use this shampoo in conjunction with a more hydrating shampoo or one that is formulated more for your hair type and rotate them out with your shampooing routine.
