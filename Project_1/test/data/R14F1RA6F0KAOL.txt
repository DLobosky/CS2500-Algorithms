I really don't think of this Mini Grinder as a "basic piece of junk" because I had mine for over 2 years and use it almost every day for small/minor projects and still works perfect, no problem what so ever, it's a very good product for the price but the only reason I'm really disappointed is because the fiber wheel does wear out fairly fast and all of my local hardware stores don't sell 3" fiber wheels, I can only find 4" and 6" but they won't fit on the mini-grinder so, every time I need a replacement fiber wheel I also have to buy the grinding wheel. If you are ready to do a LOT of grinding it's a good deal but otherwise I won't recommend this product because you will end up with a drawer full of 3" grinding wheels which is a waste of $$$...just doesn't makes any sense at all. For a few more $$$ you can get a different model 6" bench grinder and you will find replacement wheels in every hardware store around town. That's the reason why I gave this product "3 Star". They should sell the wheels individually and not in pairs.
