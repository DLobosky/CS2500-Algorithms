But then I purchased the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press (#2315), after reading a recent review of it in Cook's Illustrated. After repeatedly comparing the two side-by-side, the Kuhn is unquestionably the better press. It was also about $8 cheaper here on Amazon, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer--in any event, I didn't consider price for this review. What's strange is that the crushing mechanisms on both presses appear to be identical. In fact, prior to crushing with the Kuhn, I felt disappointed when I received it, convinced that I had just bought the same garlic press twice. However, for whatever reason (and it remains a mystery to me), the Kuhn's crushing of garlic is clearly superior in two ways: 1) It produces a more beautifully consistent mince of the garlic, whereas the result from the Rosle seems more "smashed" by comparison. The difference isn't subtle--I was honestly shocked by it. 2) The pressing is more complete, with less left behind in the hopper, and it presses unpeeled garlic better, as well. (That said, I get a much better press from either unit with peeled cloves.) Ergonomically, the shape of the Kuhn also handles better, although I never had a problem with the Rosle. And I'd say both units have stainless steel construction of equally high quality. For me, it was the crushing performance and not the handling that has sadly relegated my Rosle to the drawer, since I now always reach first for the Kuhn.UPDATE 6/11: After four years of regular use, this press continues to perform like new, so I can now add a 5 star recommendation for long-term durability, too. Unless this Kuhn Rikon somehow finds its way under a steamroller, I suspect it's the last garlic press that I'll ever have to buy. I'm baffled by the occasional complaint here that this press is hard to clean as it could hardly be any easier. Besides the handles, there are only two other parts to this unit: the mesh steel hopper through which the clove is pressed and the steel "presser" itself. As can be seen in one of the customer photos posted, both of those parts swing out (easily) from the handles, allowing you to simply rinse them clean under the faucet.
