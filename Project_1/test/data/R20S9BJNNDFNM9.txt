I hoped that this one would be just as good and it is.This DVD features a variety of comedians who entertain with clean humor.  Although most comedians these days seem to think that crude is what makes things funny, these do not.  This is a DVD that can be played with the children at home.A couple of these have particularly good routines.  I am most impressed with Dan Nainan and Bone Hampton.  Additionally this is hosted by Tim Conway who is one of the all time comic greats.I recommend this as well as Thou Shalt Laugh
