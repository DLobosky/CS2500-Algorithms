Susanna Clarke, the first time author of the book, hits on a winning combination with this story, as her sales and reviews already testify.  Because the two component genres contain some of my favorite stories (Aubrey/Maturin, Captain Alatriste & Harry Potter, LOTR), I quickly ordered it and moved it to the top of my reading list.  This is what I thought:The novel is long and contains many meandering side-stories that are loosely related to the main issue: the friendship of England's first magicians in many years, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, as well as the tests to that friendship that threaten to destroy it.  So when you begin reading, do not expect a straightforward and traditional storyline- this is not Harry Potter, and it is not Jack Aubrey & Stephen Maturin.  You will find a variety of interesting and entertaining anecdotes and tales that all serve to flesh out the quasi-historical world of England during the Napoleonic Wars.  To top this off, the book is flush with footnotes, a great many of which actually distract from what you reading, but provide meaningful background to the story and its characters.  Once I had completed the story, I almost felt that the book itself read like its many footnotes: interesting, funny, and not completely pertinent; but good nonetheless.When you read Clarke's story, you will be introduced to a world very similar to our own, where magic, once common place, is the stuff of legend.  In to this Mr. Norrell is thrust, a be speckled and ill-tempered old scholar who has deliberately and meticulously acquired nearly every book `of' magic and `about' magic in the Kingdom.  Mr. Norrell, who at times seems to prefer the study of magic to its actual practice, decides that he is the man to bring magic back to England in the service of the crown, in order to defeat Napoleon.  This glorious re-introduction leads to Mr. Norrell finding an apt pupil the one Jonathan Strange, and soon the two of them are changing the face of Europe (quite literally in some cases) with their skills.  Unfortunately a wide variety of circumstances, events and characters (including a capricious fairy) threatens to tear apart their association, and perhaps all of English magic.All in all, a good read, but a long one; you'll want to see what happens next. . .
