But will Detective Luther Cross let this unique woman go?     Gaby hunts the dark beings that haunt the night, those nasty creatures that prey on others.  She has a true calling, a sort of internal warning that sends her out hunting at a moment's notice.  Gaby has fled the connection she felt with Luther only to find him reappearing just as she is tracking something odd, a kid and yet this child seems strangely out of place. Someone or something deadly is out there... will it cost Gaby everything to stop it?      L.L. Foster has created a very intense world where demons exist and Gaby's role as a paladin is paramount.  This highly intense series takes readers into a dark side of the supernatural and yet still offers hope in the process.  SERVANT: THE ACCEPTANCE has a bit more romance than the first book in the series but is still far more of an urban or dark fantasy story than it is a paranormal romance.     It's hard not to love Gaby!  She isn't the most refined of characters but her honesty and lack of artifice is refreshing.  Gaby doesn't hesitate to protect those she loves even while she fights her own inner fear of love, making her a very believable and oddly lovable character.  Tortured heroes are fairly common in novels nowadays but L.L. Foster offers up something different: a tortured heroine, and yet a heroine who is heroic without wanting credit for her deeds.      Luther adds the needed touch of solidarity and familiarity to the story.  He asks the questions that we readers want to know about Gaby and her calling, and ultimately satisfies us with the answers about her credibility.  L.L. Foster has created perhaps the only man who could match Gaby in Luther, as Gaby is not an easy woman to get close to.     L.L. Foster takes readers on a dark journey with SERVANT: THE ACCEPTANCE, but it is a journey that is more than worth it.  This gritty and haunting series is a refreshing entry into the genre.  L.L. Foster isn't afraid to take risks with this powerful and edgy tale and it shows in the fascinating mesh of strong character development and world building.  Highly recommended! COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
