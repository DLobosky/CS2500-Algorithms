I was not too kind with my review of LADY IN THE WATER, as I found the movie to be a complete mess only saved from total disaster by its lensing and atmosphere. When I heard he was making another thriller called THE HAPPENING, I was hoping he would redeem himself. While I wasn't totally impressed, I will have to give credit where credit is due and say that THE HAPPENING succeeded on many levels, while coming dangerously close to total disaster.The premise is that something strange in the air is causing humans to lose their ability for self-preservation and find any way possible to kill themselves. The movie presents this unfolding drama quite well, especially the early scene with the construction workers. The movie earned an R rating for many of these scenes but they aren't quite R-Rated as perhaps some of the moments in Fox's FRINGE. The movie moves along quite well, often presenting the paranoia with finesse and always in the "wind you up" method that M.Night Shyamalan is famous for. I for one was brought into the situation and found myself even holding my breath a few times when the toxin was near. The discoveries they found and each turn kept me interested. The scene with the kids at the boarded up house was a shocker that broke some taboos in movie making.What brought the movie down a few ratings for me was mainly the Mrs. Jones house scene. Here, the movie went into quirky mode and with some very bad acting, it almost brought the movie down to its knees. The scene where she thought our heroes would kill her in her sleep and Wahlberg's response of "Noooo...noooo" was extremely laughable. It almost seemed like a rehearsal scene. Poorly acted. When Mrs. Jones accuses Wahlberg of stealing her doll was another quirky moment. Why Zooey Deschanel is still cast in major roles is a mystery to me. She is not that great of an actress and often a one trick pony. Add to this the "comic relief" of showing people in gas masks and huddling in their tubs and the movie was about to be done for me. But the location shots of Mrs. Jones house and the anti-climatic but still pleasant ending saved the movie. I liked THE HAPPENING and I eagerly await Shyamalan next thriller. I just hope he takes his time and can wow us again like he did with THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS.
