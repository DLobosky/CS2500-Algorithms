I got this to replace the VSX-820-K, which I liked but had few shortcomings, such as the requirement to use an analog video connection to the TV if you want to use the on screen menu. Got this at a non-Amazon retailer for well under the $399 MSRP.Looks and design: Classy black - got the spouse approval. However, like the 820-K, the cover of the front USB and video/audio ports is not connected to the receiver - it's a piece of plastic that you have to take out completely if you want to hook up a USB device or any source to the front connectors. I wish it had a permanent connection because I can completely see it getting lost. Reduced one star for this.Sound: Great. I used to have a 10-year old Denon 5.1 receiver which I loved. I think that sound quality of this Pioneer with movies is pretty much the same as my old Denon. The sound quality when playing plain music though is much much better than the Denon - just cleaner. I don't consider my self an audiophile, but I'm very happy with the sound (connected to a 5.1 Onkyo speaker set up).Video over HDMI looks good. My Wii is connected through analog RCA cable to the receiver and the video is up-converted (if that's the correct term) and comes through the single HDMI connection to the TV. Motorola Cable box and Media Center PC are also connected through HDMI and work great with no issues at all. No need to switch inputs in my TV anymore which simplifies life and the macro operation of my universal remote control.Setup is pretty usual for receivers, you will not understand many features and setup options unless you bother reading the instructions.Power: Seems to have to crank up the volume much higher than I used to with my Denon receiver and the sound is not even with that of my Home Theater PC (i.e., same volume level can hear the PC great but when I switch to cable I have to crank up the volume to get a decent sound - it may be a problem with the cable box outputing lower levels but I wish the receiver was capable dealing with that and make the volume level even with all sources).Overall for a little over $300, to get a 3D capable receiver from a reputable manufacturer such as Pioneer, with 7 channels, up-conversion and USB support is pretty amazing value. I am very happy with my purchase.
