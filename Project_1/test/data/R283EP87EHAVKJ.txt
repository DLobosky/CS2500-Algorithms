I'll just point out right now that I'm going to spend more time reviewing the movie rather than the DVD features. As a DVD, this is really nothing special (it has no commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, or any of the other extras that have come to define what DVD is about), but it's worth owning just for the movie. "Goodfellas" is one of the few films that can be put out with no bonus materials and still be great. The movie alone is enough to warrant 5 stars. Now that that's out of the way, onto my main point, this is one of the best movies ever made. In the 13 years since this movie came out, few other films have been made that rival the greatness of "Goodfellas". This is one movie that has, and will most likely continue to stand the test of time. As you've probably heard, the movie is based on a novel ("Wiseguy") by Nicholas Pillegi. It follows the rise and fall of mafia soldier Henry Hill, from his mob beginnings in the 1950s, to his eventual demise in the 1970s. One of the key aspects of this film is that it portrays the mob in a more realistic fashion than a lot of other movies do. Some films depict mobsters as bloodthirsty criminals who live only to kill, but this movie manages to capture something that many others do not ; a mobster's job isn't to kill people, a mobster's job is to make money. The killing that they have become so well known for is just a small part of that. "Goodfellas" doesn't show it's characters as the inhuman killing machines that many crime movies do, instead the characters are shown to be fairly normal individuals. This is where a lot of the appeal lies in this movie. People like to see things shown in a new way, and that's exactly what this movie does. It shows that criminals aren't really all that different from any one else. Henry's wife, Karen, explains much of this in an excellent monologue about half way through the movie.Some will say that this film glamorizes organized crime by showing all the perks of the criminal life; the money, the clothes, the cars, the respect, etc., but I think that in many ways this movie is actually very anti-crime. While Henry and his criminal cohorts do experience success, they ultimately pay the price for the lives they lived.As for the cast of this movie, they're absolutely outstanding. Liotta gives one of the best performances of his carreer, and De Niro is excellent as usual. Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco also turn in great work as supporting characters. As for Joe Pesci, he received a well deserved Academy Award for his performance. Watching the movie, you can really see the intensity Pesci provides as Tommy, Henry's maniac friend. Every time I watch this movie, I develop even more appreciation for Pesci's work. The direction is also spectacular. This is the movie that introduced me to Scorsese's work, and he's been my favorite director ever since. It's incredible to see the amount of work that he put into every frame of this movie. The stretch in the restaurant (I think it's the Copa Cabana) is some of the best photography I've ever seen.This is one movie that is definitely worth owning on DVD. A lot of movies lose their effect the more you watch them, but it's been my experience that the more I watch this movie, the more impressed I am by it. I love it more with every viewing.
