I used to purchase the pampers and then they put drymax in them which caused horrible diaper rash.  These diapers are a little more money but worth no leaks!  There is no odor or dyes in the diaper liner either which is nice!  I try to save money by using the huggies snug and dry during the day and the little movers at night.  My child sleeps through the whole night (10 plus hours) and is almost a year old and he has been waking up for 3 months in a row without being wet himself because these diapers are super absorbant.
