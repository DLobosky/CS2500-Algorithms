However if you have 4x6 this is not the album for you because you can only fit 3 per page if you don't want them to overlap.The album I bought PMV-206 comes with 10 pages which fill up really fast and the refills are pretty expensive so I have spent $40 so far on the album and 6 packs of refills which I got at Joanns.com with a discount coupon.  One with 100 pages is maybe a better deal.So this is fine but now I still may have to get one for my 4x6 where I can just slide the photos in if I didn't get enough refills.I guess this is ok but I'm not in love with it.  And like the other person said, its' really hard to get the wrinkles out and figure out where you want the photos before you stick them down because they are on there and the corners get cringed trying to get them up if you need to move them.
