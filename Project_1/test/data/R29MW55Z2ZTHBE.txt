If you have not read The Silmarillion, and/or have doubts about whether you'll like it enough to invest in a nice hardcover edition, then you probably should start with a paperback copy (with the up-to-date text).This is certainly the best edition of The Silmarillion so far published in the United States. In the UK, HarperCollins published a 30th anniversary edition in 2007, and a leather/india paper edition in 2001, both of which are marginally higher quality than this one, but both are very difficult to find in the US, and cost three to five times what Amazon charges for this edition. Easton Press also has an edition of The Silmarillion, in full leather with hubbed spine and gilt edges no less, but it is only available as part of a five volume set including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, at a price of nearly $300. The details:*The cloth binding is rugged and attractive, coated with a semi-glossy protectant so that it resembles leather somewhat, but without the texture of leather or leatherette. It is a very sturdy sewn signature binding which will survive multiple readings easily, which is particularly appropriate to The Silmarillion, since most of all of Tolkien's major works readers tend to re-read sections over and over, and use the book somewhat like a reference book. The spine is foil stamped in gold, and the stamping is sharp and good looking. *The paper stock is the same as was used in the 1992 hardcover box set of Lord of the Rings illustrated by Alan Lee (the book's dimensions are the same also). This paper is coated and slightly glossy, and takes ink very well. It also resists permanent staining or marking (dirty fingerprints or other stains easily wipe off with a damp paper towel). The printing itself is dark, clear, and consistent. In the year I've owned this book, even in the humid climate I live in, I have found absolutely NO transference of ink, either from text or the color plates. Given the glossy stock, this is an indicator of very high quality production. The fold out map of Beleriand (and part of Middle-earth) is glued inside the back cover, and is a lovely full color glossy representation, much less prone to tearing than many other maps bound into Tolkien titles. *As for the Ted Nasmith illustrations, they are quite different in style from Alan Lee (and Nasmith's work's here in oil paint, where Lee's LOTR and Hobbit work has been mostly watercolor or tempera), but beautifully evocative, lush in color, and more "modern" and realistic than Lee's. Like the 1992 (re-issued 2002) boxed-set of LOTR, the illustrations are printed on the obverse (right hand) of the page, and the text continues on the reverse (left hand), so there are no blank page sides, which I think is more attractive. The illustrations are lovely and well complement the text. A few of these plates are new to this edition, and do not appear in the 2001 hardcover of The Silmarillion (ISBN 0618135049; jacket image of elves awaking at Cuivienen). This edition is a larger format than that book, and thus are the illustrations.Lastly, this edition contains a new (1999) preface by Christopher Tolkien, and the famous 1951 Milton Waldman letter in which Tolkien presents one of the most comprehensive and coherent descriptions and explanations he ever made of his conception of his legendarium. The text is technically "2nd edition, revised," and thus contains a few corrections not in earlier second edition printings. I highly recommend this edition of The Silmarillion for anyone seeking a copy that is both a beautiful addition to one's library, and one which will stand up to years of reading. It is uncommon to find both qualities in one book.
