Comment: The parts of the "story that show Dinosaurs in action are so "lifelike" that they so overwhelm the rest of the "normal" show. You can't wait for the "action" to get back to the Dinosaurs so much that the documentary of real people just gets "annoying". I noticed that if you sat a little closer than normal to the screen, the 3D became very, very good. When I sat at my normal distance from the screen the 3D picture was ever so slightly out of focus. Other than that little item the 3D was stellar. I use Samsung equipment. I can't wait to see a full length documentary on Dinosaurs without the (real) human aspect added to the documentary. Overall this 3D documentary had no artifacts I found annoying. The sound was great... the picture stellar. If you have had any thoughts of purchasing 3D equipment for playback on your home, now might be the time. The selection and quality of 3D titles is increasing. Come join us in seeing these 3D titles without the hassle of standing in line etc. The reproduction in the home is as good or better than the theater experience. (The disc can cost as little as one admission in some cases.)
