I have been a Lilian Braun fan for so long I've managed to forget most of the stories, which is a perfect excuse to start rereading them.  &quot;The Cat Who Could Read Backwards&quot; is the first, written in 1966, starting a series that has run for over thirty years.  Unlike most if the series, which takes place in the northern town of Pickaxe.  These early books cover Jim Qwilleran's career urban career Down Below, working for the Daily Fluxion.  While Qwill had once been a highly respected crime reporter, he had fallen victim to his drinking habits.  Now, once again sober, he has accepted a job as art feature writer for the Fluxion, which already has the cities most controversial art critic - George Bonifield Mountclemens (the Third).  Other than the minor drawback of knowing nothing about art, Qwill is anxious to start.  He quickly dives into the city's thriving art world, and discovers that all is not roses and harmony.  Mountclemens is universally unpopular among most of the artists and galleries and is noted for scathing reviews.  Cal Halapay, the first artist interviewed is one of Mountclemens victims, and almost all the artists Qwill meets have endures similar treatment.  In addition, the city's artists are fiercely competitive.  So it comes as a surprise that the first murder of the novel is not Mountclemens, but Earl Lambreth, the owner of the city's poshest gallery.Despite Mountclemens' reputation, Qwill finds that he likes him.  More important to readers of the series, Mountclemens' cat, Kao K'o-Kung, takes a liking to Qwilleran.  Koko, as he become known, is &quot;The Cat Who...&quot;, without whom few of Qwill's mysteries would ever get solved.  Also introduced in this volume are many of the wonderful characters that go one to people many of Lilian Braun's efforts.  Especially Archer Riker, the Fluxion's feature editor and Odd Bunsen the erratic, outspoken newspaper photographer.Lilian Braun's novels are of the more or less non-violent, puzzle-oriented genre often labeled 'cozies.'  They make up for the lack of a tense, driving plot by emphasizing charming, irascible characters, and a somewhat tongue-in-cheek attitude.  Braun is extremely successful at this.  Sometimes the reader will feel that the murder is more of a subplot rather than the primary them of the novel.  Fans are comfortable with this, but the newcomer needs to be prepared for these endearing, but picaresque tales.
