For instance the chain function only affects the cutting of the labels not the print or format.  I haven't tried the PC SW and interface but it looks rather like overkill for my projects.  Easier to use, much more flexible, and way more uses that I expected. (I am doing a deck replacement remodel and needed a way to track screws and small parts.)
