I didn't read the Bible all the way through until I was 18 years old. As I read, I couldn't help but notice the discrepancy between the teachings of Scripture and the teachings of the Catholic Church. After a very short time, I felt like I needed to leave the Catholic Church, so I did. It was not an easy decision because the majority of my mom's family (who I am very close to) is Roman Catholic and I know my mom and others in my family would not understand why I felt I needed to leave the Catholic Church. I wanted to find a book that laid Catholic teaching and the Bible side by side and compared in a accurate, truthful manner. A Woman Rides the Beast is that book. Dave Hunt does an excellent job of exposing what the Catholic Church actually teaches. I can tell you based on my experience with the Catholic Church, Dave hits the nail right on the head. Dave Hunt also discusses the trend among Evangelicals to embrace Catholics as Christian brothers. This is a tread that started more than a decade ago and is still prevelant today. I think the main reason is ignorance of what the Catholic Church teaches. This book is very hard-hitting and will make you uncomfortable. It will definitely move you out of your comfort zone and make you think. I think this book should be required reading for new Christians and everyone who considers themself an evangelical. It is an eye opening book. If read with an open mind, I believe that God can and will use this book to expose the incredible deception of the Catholic Church. This book is written in a very readable style. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a former or current Catholic. But even if you aren't a former Catholic yourself, every Christian needs to read this book. Catholicism is not going to go away and we need to be equipped to deal with it. Whether we like it or not. Sweeping the problem under the rug by embracing Catholics as Christians is not the answer. Now, I am not saying that all Catholics are lost. I truly believe there are some people in the Catholic Church who are trusting in Christ alone for salvation. I know quite a few people who have gone through the same type of struggle I did with the Catholic Church. I have found that the majority of people who have true saving faith in Christ find themselves unable to remain part of the Catholic Church and leave. I believe that Catholics make up one of the biggest mission fields in the world today. Jesus commanded us to share the Gospel with every creature. That includes Catholics. I believe we do a great disservice to Roman Catholics when we choose not to share Christ with them. But at the same time, we need to realize that we will never be able to argue someone to Christ. It just doesn't work. Evangelism in general, but especially to Catholics, requres grace, humility and a total reliance on the Holy Spirit. But at the same time, I don't think that we should sugarcoat or water down the truth either. It is also important to remember that the Bible predicts that in the last days, (which I truly believe we are living in) the Roman religous system from the ancient Roman Empire will be resurrected. In conclusion, I highly recommend this book. This book has had a major impact on my life. I believe it will do the same for anyone who reads it with an open mind and a teachable heart.
