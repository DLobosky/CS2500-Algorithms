The 2 skipped over are > "Hillbilly girl with the blues" 1980 and "It's a dirty job" (with Bobby Bare) 1983. Another noteable song of the same time period is "Wild turkey". Although it is a b-side, it is one of Dalton's best. This c.d. covers just under the first half of Dalton's hits. Lacy J. went on to have 12 additional songs chart between 1983 and 1990, 6 of which are top 10 hits. This c.d. is all origianl recordings.
