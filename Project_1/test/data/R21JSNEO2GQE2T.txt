How does it treat a problem of this magnitude on a drive it claimed should be used to "save your life"? It treats them like cash cows and dedicates a major part of its support website to advertising that it will find your files on your crashed drive.....For an UNNAMED PRICE which others here have said is VERY VERY high. One review I read on another site said they wanted $1700 for 300gb of data. Many write of being quoted thousands of dollars as the retrival price. I am neither paranoid nor the kind of person who readily see conspiracies but this behavior seems preplanned. Your data is being held hostage!!! Just pay them the price of a new laptop (or more) to get it back!!!IF this company cared about your business they would have offered to transfer your files to a refurbished replacement drive for FREE (on any drive in warrenty that fails). This is TOTALLY THEIR ISSUE. Instead they try to FLEECE YOU TWICE. Remember that when you are tempted to buy Seagate products in the future.I had this drive for about 6 months during which time it worked fine. Suddenly it died, taking with it picture of my recently deceased father, many ITUNES files and family videos that were too large to fit on DVD. Isn't that what you use a drive this size for, things that don't fit on your computer anymore and/or are too large for DVD? All this drive does is allow you the heartache of losing everything at one time. It should not be relied on to back up anything. I have older drives that have lasted for years. This is a VERY VERY BAD product. Forget the cost of this piece of trash! I figure I'm out several hundred dollars worth of MP3 files alone. The family photos and videos are the worst part but I know my father would never want me to pay these people hundreds more to save old images of him. If you need one more reason to avoid this company, note that my father is surely going to haunt the factory. Please note that there is also a problem with the software. Once the drive fails, if you try to connect it your system you can get a blue screen and lose whatever you are working on. Update:Seagate is NOT some fly by night company. I feel they knew exactly what they were doing when they matched a poorly designed hard drive with an ad campaign that encouraged you to "SAVE YOUR LIFE" on their drives and then set you up to pay huge amounts of money to them to get your data back. I have complained to the Federal Trade Comission about this and hopefully if enough of us do someone will mount a lawsuit against them. At the very least they should have issued a public recall of this product when they realized it was failing in record numbers. Their 5 year warranty is also a farce since no one in their right mind would want another of these, especially a refurbished one. IF YOU OWN THIS DRIVE and it is still working...BACK UP YOUR FILES NOW...If they are still there...it also over-writes files.
