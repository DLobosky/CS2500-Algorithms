Little Caesar is a early talkie classic, The Public Enemy packs a wow! finish, The Petrified Forest is a great little play made into an interesting movie, The Roaring Twenties is big budget glitz, Angels with Dirty Faces plays a different tune and White Heat is amazing!  How enjoyable can a film collection be?
