This is the second book that I've read by Leslie and I have to say that I absolutely loved it!  I was a little leery about reading any of her other books after Sister Got Game for fear of being disappointed.  This book was just as good as that book and I'm so glad that I gave it a chance.  I loved the characters especially Karin.  I was so happy when she kicked her doctor boyfriend to the curb.  The story was well written and it had an excellent plot.  The characters were well developed and the story flowed really well. I especially liked the fact that there weren't any editing issues.  I enjoyed this story so much so I highly recommend it to those who have yet to read it.  It's been out a while but who cares lol.  You'll be disappointed when you come to the last page....it's that good!
