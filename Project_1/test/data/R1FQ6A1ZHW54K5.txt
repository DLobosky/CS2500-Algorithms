In the last scene of "Batman Begins" Batman flips over a card & it turns out 2 B The Joker Card. After I saw that scene I thirsted 4 a sequal. Everyday I ran 2 the computer 2 C who they cast as The Joker. Then the Big news had been revealed; The Joker was going 2 B played by Heath Ledger. I as many fans out their back then really didn't know what 2 think(In fact I was somewhat disappointed). It wasn't until I saw the 1st trailer 4 the movie that I started jumping off the walls & began counting down the days till the film's release.Then Heath died. I as many fans out there mourned his death & wondered what would happen 2 "The Dark Knight." WB'S gave everybody a sign of relief when they said that the movie was going in2 post production & that the film was set 2 B released as scheduled. After I saw the film Iron Man I began 2 wonder how "The Dark Knight" was going 2 top this. I found out the day of its release.1st off the movie leaves U (@ each & every moment) on the edge of your seat (Literally I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair). The chase scenes w/ Batman & the Bat-pod were superb, & The cast was terrific.Christian Bale still continued 2 prove that he was the greatest Batman of all time & gave a stunning performance as both Bruce Wayne & Batman. Aaron Eckhart gave a gr8 performance as Harvey Dent, & gave a chilling performance as Two-Face (which made Tommy Lee Jone's performance in "Batman Forever" look really Bad). Gary Oldman continued to WOW me as Lieutenant James Gordon (who later becomes Commisioner), & Maggie Gyllenhal took on the role of Rachel Dawes (which was 1st played by Katie Holmes).However, the performance that I think stole the show was Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. Now I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 film "Batman," however, Heath's Joker made Jack's look like one of those clowns that entertains @ children's B-day parties. This Joker was dark, extremely disturbed & loved 2 cause chaos in Gotham by Blowing up a hospital in a nurse's outfit (LOL), poisoning the police commisioner w/ sulfuric acid, making a "Pencil disappear," & blowing up the building of the MCU w/ a bomb implanted inside of another prisoner. This Joker also looked very different he had long greasy green hair, he had a carved smile on his face, & his makeup looked as if it had been applied & not like he had fallen in2 a vat of chemicals. Heath's joker also symbolized the joker that is in the comics 2day; he has no backstory(although U find out bits & pieces of his backstory in the scenes he's in) doesen't have a real name, has an extremely creepy laugh, is more crazy than ever, & he gets the last laugh.The movie is centered around 3 characters; Batman, Gordon, & Harvey Dent. The Joker then sets his sights out on all 3 men but especially Harey Dent & (in a way)turns Harvey in2 Two-Face which leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween these characters. This movie also makes Bruce Wayne/Batman face the question if he is doing any good in Gotham or is he responsible 4 the chaos that The Joker is causing. Bruce even considers turning himself in2 the police. Oh, & 2 people die in this movie (can't say who).Its been 2 months since the films release & it has made over 500 million dollars (beating all Star Wars films WOW) but still comming short 2 Titanic. A sequal may be comming soon but 2 me it really doesen't matter 2 me if they make a sequal or not. This film unlike "Batman Begins" doesen't make U want a sequal. It ends in a very concluding way.Now I know I just wasted a whole page writing about this movie but now all I have 2 say is; YOU HAVE 2 SEE THIS MOVIE PREORDER IT NOW WHAT R U WAITING 4?
