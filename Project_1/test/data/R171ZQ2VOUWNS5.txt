The protagonist Corwin's terrific dynamism and cunning drive the first five chapters. The last five chapters focus on his son, Merlin, and are well characterized by Merlin's statement, "I'm not in the same league as my father". Picture Homer's Odyssey with the entire second half devoted to Telemachus. Perhaps Zelazny had done better to have synchronous plots going on here with both characters. From chapter six on, the tale slowly decelerates with Merlin. In fact, it's the expansion of the plot complications and range of characters already encountered in the first half of the book that makes Merlin's yarn sustainable. Compared with Corwin's judgment and shrewd cunning, Merlin's decisions seem unsure, his actions overly intuitive. That said, this is fantastic fantasy, even if fantasy is not your fancy. The Great Book of Amber is addictive and may leave you bleary-eyed till you finish it. It reminds me of The Pattern mentioned many times in the book: Once you dare to start you dare not stop until you reach the end. The book holds up well when reread, also.
