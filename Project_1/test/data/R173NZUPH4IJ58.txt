I bought this when I couldn't find a sesame sauce I was looking for.  What a nice surprise!  Our closest Panda Express is 70 miles, so what a treat to find this!  Taste is very tasty orange and ginger with some heat to it.  Nice blend of flavors to use in a variety of ways.  We've dipped chicken nuggets and egg rolls in it, plus you can pour it on some chicken breasts and then bake them up quickly in the oven.  Sauce would be sticky to use as a marinade before grilling, but can be used as a sauce/dip for grilled chicken or for making your own orange chicken or orange beef at home!  Two thumbs up from our house!
