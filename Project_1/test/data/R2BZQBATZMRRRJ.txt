The first I had was the first generation long zoom range lens from Tamron- 28-200mm for canon- similar to this 18-135mm Pentax. I still have it, and it's attached to my Canon EOS 500 film camera in the back cupboard. The second was the Tamron 18-200mm lens, which you can read my review on Amazon for, if you so wish. In hindsight, I rated it slightly higher than I now realise it was deserving of, as my expereince has grown over the last year.I just went on a 4 day holiday, brought along 4 lenses to try out, and this 18-135mm spent 99% of the time on my K-5. I used a Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 at a few times at night, and the Sigma 30mm f1.4 never got used.In short, it is everything people say. Focusing is quick and quiet. The zoom range is very useable. Photos are sharp. The ability to close focus at 40cm, regardless of focal length, is very helpful. Other zooms have a minimum focal length of around 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet), so you can really get in close with this lens.To be frank, this is how all their (Pentax) lenses should be in terms of focusing. Canon has had quick and quiet lenses for years. The Weather Resistance aspect isn't very important to me, but it helps I dont have to worry if it starts raining and rush to put the camera away while diving for the nearest sheltor. It is also small and light for it's zoom range. Well suited to general walkabout and travelling photography. Not well suited to those who demand more sharpness, bokeh, reach or sensitivity. I did find I wish I could get more bokeh, and it was faster so my night photos weren't always at iso 12,800.The only problems I've had, after taking around 1000 photos, are some unexpected focus hunting half a dozen time, usually with more distant objects, especially narrow buildings or objects. I have no idea why.So far, no sign of zoom creep, although there is no lock. Early days though. The barrel is not as stiff as it was when I first bought it last week.Other shortcomings I've noticed are evident in all long zoom lenses. at it's widest, photos are not as sharp. Bokeh is not really something you can get very often, but look ok compared to the other long zooms I've had. It's very different to, say, my Pentax DAL 50-300mm, which seems to naturally produce very lovely bokeh with most photos, despite an even longer zoom range.If they were able to produce this with constant f2.8, I would defintely give it a look, even though it would probably weigh a kilo or more. (it'd probably be beyond my budget though!)Edit 25th August 2011---------------------Found a few tiny tiny bubbles of water (too spherical for dust imho- only 0.3mm across- ok- i dont know exactly how wide- my point is, is that they are really small) on the plastic inside the lens, though not on glass of lens, so doesnt affect the photo. Sent back to Japan with my K-5 to fix. (K-5's rear LCD had a defect).In general, these types of lenses- super zooms, produce in focus photos, but usually only moderately sharp, and rarely with bokeh. I found I can produce bokeh, but you have to work at it. This is why I mentioned the 55-300mm lens before, because it produced bokeh naturally, if I can put it that way. For the 55-300mm, all I would have to do is focus on, say, a tree or flower, and the background would be naturally out of focus. With the 18-135, and superzooms starting from 18mm (28-35mm in 35mm format), there is no bokeh and the subject and surrounding is usually all in focus, unless you position yourself the make the subject a reasonable distance from the background. Otherwise, everything is in focus, as if f22 plus is a aperture by default, despite settings.
