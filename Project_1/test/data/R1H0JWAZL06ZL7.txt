In it, a young New England girl wanders through the fog to another village in earlier, Colonial times. On her visits, she makes friends with another little girl in the village. There's a bittersweet feeling when she realizes that where the village once was, now only cellar holes remain. Ghosts, time-travel, and a hint of Brigadoon made this book one that I still remember as an adult.
