He loses Instruction Manual Book in the dessert.  In the episode 2 of Season One of The Greatest American Hero, Ralph and Pam are setting up the high school play in Whitney High, and Johnny Damani, the car gun, has been chased by his ex-girlfriend, Scarlett Wilde.  In the episode 4 of Season One of The Greatest American Hero, Ralph, Pam, and the special education students are helping Bill Maxwell to search for the missing of the Russian Guy, Sergei Bolankov, and his Italian wife, Marissa.  In the episode 6 of Season One of The Greatest American Hero, Ralph has been identifying the Cowboy childhood, John Hart.  In the episode 7 of Season One of The Greatest American Hero, One of the Ralph's students, Tony Villacana (Michael Pare)has been arrested and he was playing the fire at the Cameron Auto Shop.  In the episode 8 of Season One of The Greatest American Hero, Ralph Hinkley (Hanley)has become the vice-principal of Whitney High. Pam Davidson has become the junior law firm partner, and she was being kidnapped by Clarence Carter.  This is the most 80s television show.
