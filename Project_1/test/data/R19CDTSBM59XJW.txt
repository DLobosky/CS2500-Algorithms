This 3 part series tells what we know (or think we know) about early man.It`s strictly information. They make no attempt to entertain anyone.This, part 3 of the series, has focus on the middle and upper paleolithic.Great for high school science classes or anyone who is truely interested in what is known about early man without a lot of fluffthrown in.
