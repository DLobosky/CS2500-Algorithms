This is very cute and tame, but I would rate it PG only because little kids might not enjoy it like they would a Toy Story or other kid's movie.  Good for 8 years old and up, I'd say.  Some small incongruencies in the story line that are not too noticeable unless you are very critical.Cute story about a young woman who goes for a job interview as an advertising executive, and she ends up being hired as a nanny instead.  Fun, predictable, just a nice movie to watch when little eyes and ears are around.  No profanity, no nudity, no politics, just a simple Christmas romantic comedy.  Fun movie for a slumber party for young preteens and teens.  Good backup movie to show during family gatherings to avoid fights because most people have never seen it before.
