First of four in the Twilight Saga, the Young Adult series that rocked the publishing world. Well . . . the world (lol). It may not have entered the household lexicon yet, like the Harry Potter books, but by now, most readers probably have a general idea about the romance of the human Belle and the vampire Edward. Meyer's world building is complex, but quiet. You always get the sense that there is more: the characters exist outside of the pages and you are seeing just a small part of their lives. It is hard to believe that she was a new writer.This first book hooks you from the start. A first person narrative of a teenager that just moved into a small town is NOT something that would normally interest me, but Meyer writes so effortlessly, the pages just flow. Before you know it, you are completely engrossed in Belle's view point.Even if you are too old for YA, even if vampires leave you cold (ha-ha), I STILL suggest that you give this one a try.
