There's a little too much slapstickery and a little too much of Tim Curry explaining everything over and over, to relenting comic effect. I was hoping for more after reading the reviews here, but honestly the only wonderful thing for me was the very lush photography. Every shot is well-composed and blocked; this film looks lovely. No complaints, really, but we just didn't laugh as much as expected, despite the film's non-stop efforts in that direction. Madeline Kahn did crack us up a few times, just by watching her reactions. She's the only one who stood out for me, though Curry is always good humor. All in all, I kept thinking of how much more I liked Murder By Death, Clue's predecessor and its superior in most ways. Nonetheless, Clue is worth seeing for the photography and the generally pleasant vibe of it all, if you're in need of a very light comedy.
