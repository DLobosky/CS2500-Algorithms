Plug and play use with vista, proprietary software installation optional, mainly for G key usage.  Overall quality is pretty good (heavy/sturdy).  10key numeric pad a must.  Dedicated media keys and volume wheel (had to put in a fix for use with itunes when not active window but at least it worked - thank you random sites that post solutions.)  All the usual windows dedicated keys (windows, right-click) etc.  Last but not least (near top priority actually): delete/home/end/pageup/pagedown (i'll call it dhepp) layout with 3keys across x 2down has not been messed with like some other logitech keyboards. Must admit the blue lighting is *the* major selling feature - too cool and useful for typing in dim lighting at night.Cons: Prefer full size escape and pf keys since i use them a lot.  Some of the heavy use keys (backspace, space) started to stick a bit and it's barely been 6 months - annoying -still functioning but major CON. Keys are a bit high/clackety but have had worse - in comparison, the absolute best was the S510 logitech keyboard with regular keyboard keys but mid-rise/height.  While S510 has unbeatable key action it also, unfortunately, has the rotten 2 across dhepp/insert layout and had to go. I keep looking for something with the S510 key feel and can't find it.  Also would like to have a wrist rest like S510. I programmed the gkeys and use them regularly but not a hardship to do without either in the interest decluttering escape key area - gkeys are confusing my touch usage of the escape key a bit (since that is usually my farthest key out). Realize gkeys are gamer feature on gamer keyboard so can't complain too much but maybe better to place them on the right of the 10-key pad.
