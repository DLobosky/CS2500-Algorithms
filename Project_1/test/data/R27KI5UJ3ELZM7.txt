La Lupe was a truly scandalous and controversial figure in the Latin music world. Her very scandalous and shocking live performances (she allegedly tore up her clothes on stage once) put her in a class all by herself. In a certain way, she was a precursor to Donna Summer and Madonna. This CD is a good compilation of romantic boleros and all are sung in La Lupe's melodramatic, intense and at times hysterical style.
