This is a movie that i genuinely enjoyed. The movie had an excellent plot.  The actors were outstanding. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage played the  heros very weel Ed Harris was outstanding in his role as a disillusioned  Marine General. When Harris and his former troops seize Alcatraz and  threaten San Francisco with chemical weapons the UniteD States government  has to find an answer. Navy Seals(who were well played) are slaughtered by  the Marine troops fall short. The government is forced to call upon the  only man to ever break out of Alcatraz(Sean Connery). Connery,accompanied  by chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage penetrates Alcatraz. The action  from that point is nonstop. Connery and Cage finally manage to offst and  nuetralize the chemical weapons. Cage declares that Connery has been killed  and Connery escapes to freedom after being imprisoned for more than 20  years. The final scene,where Cage obtains stolen film is a very fitting end  to a good movie. This is a must see movie. Be sure to see it.
