These are nalgene or Klean Kanteen type bottles.  I can fit 2 putters in the front and a mini in the front slot.  In the main compartment there is a velcro divider.  I can easily fit 6-8 discs, 10 if I cram them in.  This is in addition to the putters.  On the side is a zippered area for keys, in the lid area for phone or other items, on the side another accessory pocket for additional marker or other items.The bag sits up-right and has feet to keep it from getting to beat up on the bottom.  I've been using mine for about 8 months in mud and dirt and it shows very few signs of wear.  Great pockets.The downside is that the cushion on the strap does not move.  Overall, I recommend this bag.  My girlfriend has the Nutsac, and it holds fewer discs, has no bottle holder, a useless mini holder and costs more.  I had the Lightning beginner bag and it was junk at half the price.  I don't see the point of the backpack bags or large tourney bags.So for those looking for similar size bag and options, this is it.UPDATE:I recently sold this bag and after much searching and trial/error, I have settled on an Osprey Resource Veer Shoulder Bag.  It offers all of the portability of a NutSac style bag, with compartments for scorecard, a water bottle slot, keychain holder, sunglass holder, marker/mini slot, putter slot.  Even better, the bag is very light and can be used for a variety of purposes, including day hikes and travel.For a pure disc golf bag in this price range, the Fade Crunch is still a good bag, just too bulky and specialized and heavy for my use.
