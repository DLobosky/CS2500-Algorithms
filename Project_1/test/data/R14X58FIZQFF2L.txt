We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the mish mash out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added. He'll eat the sweet potato and other veggie pouches when he is more hungry, but probably because of the sweetness of fruit, he far prefers the fruit mish mashes to the veggie ones. For smaller children, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3 oz size rather than the bigger one like this (4 oz) because it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. They only keep for 24 hours after opening and need to be refrigerated if not eaten, but then he doesn't like them cold, so they have to be warmed up a bit in warm water to reuse, so a bit of a hassle. You can also take the 3 oz size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger 4 oz pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.
