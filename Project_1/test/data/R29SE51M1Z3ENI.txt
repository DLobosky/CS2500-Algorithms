In this sequal to Journey to Nowhere, Rememberance Nye, called Mem by her family, is twelve years old in 1816, and it's been a year since her family left Connecticut to begin a new life on the frontier. But Papa's crops  failed because of strange summer frosts, and since Mama gave birth to baby  Lily, she's been having terrible spells. This is an excellant story of a  pioneer family fighting to survive in the wilderness. I can't wait to read  the third book which will complete this trilogy.
