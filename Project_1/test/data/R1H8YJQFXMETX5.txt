I have enjoyed other Anna Quindlen books- Blessings, One True Thing, and Black and Blue. Anna has a way to take us into situations that can be quite uncomfortable and makes one feel so many different emotions all at once. This book is no different.When the book begins we are introduced to Mary Beth Latham and her family: her husband Glen an ophthalmologist, her teenage twin sons Alex and Max, and her teenage daughter Ruby. They seem to have it all even though they are not the perfect family by any means. As Max suffers from depression, Mary Beth becomes concerned for him. She is so concerned for him that she does not see the impending doom about to happen.I had no idea what was going to happen in this book. I felt as shocked as the characters in the story. I could feel the confusion and gut wrenching pain that the characters felt. I knew Mary Beth's life was going to fall apart but I had no clue what was coming. When it did happen, I felt as though the wind was knocked out of my sails! I think it is great that an author can make a reader feel so much emotions with their words. The story is a book of tragedy and survival. How much can one person take and how do they go on and survive? It is quite an emotional roller coaster.I highly recommend this book. It touched me in a way that was quite surprising to me. When you finish this book you will want to not take life for granted and you will want to hug those around you. This is a book you not only read but experience! What a powerful book! It's a book you won't soon forget!
