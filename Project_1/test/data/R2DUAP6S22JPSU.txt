This is a CD release by the talented the Black Eyed Peas, titled "The Beginning". The CD is a relatively weaker release as compared with their releases in the past, with mega-hits including, "I Gotta Feeling", "Boom Boom Pow" & "Where Is The Love?" The album may please die-hard fans but others may better listen to this CD release first before buying (Electro-dance/pop album). The CD opens with an okay track, "The Time(Dirty Bit", an electro-pop song with samples from "(I've Had) The Time Of My Life". Other okay tracks include "Love You Long Time", "Xoxoxo", "Fashion Beats", "Don't Stop The Party" & "Best One Yet(The Boy)". "Do I Like This" is a rather weak electro-hip hop track. Notable tracks from this CD include "Light Up The Night", "Someday", "Whenever", "Just Can't Get Enough" & "Play It Loud". The rhyming is there, but the lyrics are not at all that inspirational. On listening this CD as a whole a few times, one gets the impression/feeling  that it may well have been done in a hurry. The melodies as well as harmonies & choruses could/should have been better! The Black Eyed Peas are a talented bunch of a band, Will.I.Am a notable producer, have released a rather okay/good album "The Beginning", but they are not at their best. If you are a die-hard/fanatical fan, you will/may enjoy this CD. If you are an 'occasional' fan, rather listen to this CD before buying.
