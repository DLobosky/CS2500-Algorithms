I mean, this book was just so engaging. This book was about a street hustler, Jude, who ends up having really cool powers. I loved her "hardness" or survival instincts as the author phrased it. I also loved her interaction with the other characters, especially Gillian.The writer tells the story in such vivid descriptions that I felt that I was on those streets, I felt like I could smell the beignets or envision the moody New Orleans weather. This was an action packed journey that Jude and the Convenant takes the reader on. I would have loved to learn more about Hart's younger years with Williams. Being that evil had to take some time to develop so maybe we can get a book on them growing up. Also, I really thought she would end up someone different than who she did (I don't want to give it away) but she made her choice and stuck to it. I really liked her man, I mean he is a good man and treats like she is the best thing ever, but I liked the dark, mysterious thing with Guy #1. I just felt like there was unfinished business there, so I will have to wait for the sequel.
