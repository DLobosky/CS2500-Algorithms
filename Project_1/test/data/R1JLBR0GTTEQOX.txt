The book has short sections on the following topics: a short history of Italian hams and sausages; how Italian hams and sausages are produced; and how Italian hams and sausages are served.  The rest of the book discusses 31 different types of Italian hams and sausages.  Each of the 31 different hams and sausages is covered in short sections of 1-3 pages that include the area of origin of the ham or sausage, some history about the ham or sausage, how the ham or sausage is often prepared and served, and one or two recipes for the particular ham or sausage.  The book also has some useful illustrations.This book is not a substitute for an Italian cookbook, and not a substitute for a book on the history of Italian hams and sausages.  But, the book provides a basic introduction to Italian hams and sausages that the average person can find helpful and easy to use.  Many of the recipes in the book are very basic and easy to do, but some of the recipes are more involved and could be challenging for some persons.  Also, some of the recipes will be difficult to try at all (without making substitutions) because of the limited availability of some Italian hams and sausages.
