I have to say that I had my doubts with this movie.  All the reviews and critics loved it and said it had a great story line that not only engaged the ladies in the audience but had plenty of action and tongue in cheek humor that kept the guys interested as well.  I think that this is a five star movie because it has something for everyone.  at the end of the movie, you are left feeling satisfied and wanting to see it again.  I hope you give this movie a chance as it is a great flick for family movie night!
