The first thing that comes to mind when I listen to Lamb of God is "they sound like Pantera".  This is a complement.  I love Pantera.  But they are not a copycat band so you are still going to get originality combined with pulse-pounding heavy metal intensity.  I also have "As The Palaces Burn" and really like that album too, but I'd say that Sacrament is a bit more refined.  Love the riffage on both albums.  There is a whole lot to like about Lamb of God.  Consider both for your metal collection.
