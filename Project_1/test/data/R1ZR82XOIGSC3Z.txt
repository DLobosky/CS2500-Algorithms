My son used this for preschool along with the matching dinosaur backpack.  The backpack is going strong in kindergarten but the lunch box had to be returned because it became unusable.  The zipper became impossible to zip and unzip; an adult could barely unzip it much less my child who doesn't have the strongest hands and gets frustrated easily.  It felt like the zipper got gummy and not easy to slide.  Besides that, this lunch box is very rigid, meaning that if your container (I use these:EasyLunchboxes 3-compartment Bento Lunch Box Containers (Set of 4) BPA-Free. Easy-Open Lids (Not Leakproof)) is slightly too big, there's no give and it simply won't fit.  I replaced this Crocodile Creek box with this one and it's more flexible, a little larger and easy to zip: Stephen Joseph Lunch Box, Race Car.  Like I said, I LOVE Crocodile Creek's matching dino backpack; it looks as good as it did on day 1!  But we're not a fan of their lunch box.  Another difference is that the Stephen box has a netted section for a napkin and cutlery and a velcro drink wrap.
