Fortunately, it can be replaced with any headset that uses a standard 1/8" jack.  All you do is disconnect the standard headset from the adapter (the block thing with the volume control that plugs into your Xbox controller), and connect the Jabra in its place.  It takes a little force to push it in all the way, but otherwise it fits perfectly.The other reason I wanted to replace the Xbox headset is because with some Xbox games (like Mech Assault 2), if I want to wear headphones, I need to wear them over the headset.  As you can imagine, that's uncomfortable.  The Jabra headset fits over the ear and is flush against the head.  While I'm wearing it, I can comfortably wear my headphones over it.Not only does this headset work with my Xbox, but it works with my cordless phone and my cell phone.  That makes this headset a great value.The sound is very good, and everyone I talk to says my voice is clear.  I think this is a great headset, and I'm very happy with my purchase.
