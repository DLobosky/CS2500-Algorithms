I'm hooked on Mill Creek's great 50 packs. As others have pointed out, this set has some duplication with previous Mill Creek sets. Let me add two more cautions:* These are 12 single-sided discs, not double-sided. Easier to handle, but probably more compressed.* This set contains mostly public domain movies, but at least six are copyrighted by Crown International Pictures. Looks like Brain Twisters (1991), The Crater Lake Monster (1977), The Creeping Terror (1964), Death Machines (1976), Galaxina (1980), and Horror High (1974) are Crown products. There may be more. If you like to use movie clips for mashups or other fun stuff, hands off of these.Mind you, I'm happy to get copies of Galaxina and The Creeping Terror to watch. I just wish Mill Creek had more prominently labeled which movies are copyrighted and which ones are up for grabs.
