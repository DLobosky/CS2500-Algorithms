It is therefore hard to fathom that it has taken this long for a comprehensive history of its tale to be assembled.  Rather than relying on just a singular side of the story -- as found in Louisa May Alcott's "Transcendental Wild Oats," for example -- author Richard Francis has offered to us the widest possible view.  He has studied the journals, letters, and essays of all of the major players in the drama (as well as their friends and relatives) in order to piece together the ultimate reality.  The result is as close as we can reasonably get to what must have transpired in the Transcendental experiment based on that tiny hillside farm in Harvard, Massachusetts, in 1843:  the one that Francis calls "one of history's most unsuccessful utopias ever -- but also one of the most dramatic and significant."Fruitlands' roots lay in Bronson Alcott's Temple school set-up in Boston.  After his teaching techniques were published in book form (with the help of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody), they influenced a few English Transcendentalists like James Pierrepont Greaves, and led to the creation of Alcott Hall, a school in England.  Thus began an intricate relationship between the Alcotts and Englishmen Charles Lane and Henry Gardiner Wright, who were disciples of Greaves.  It took only a bit of imagination to further believe that their theories could create a heaven on earth, on a 100-acre farm in rural Massachusetts.  The Brits crossed the ocean to seal the deal and to start new lives.Author Francis has uncovered insights to the Fruitlands history that have been languishing in archives for years.  Especially valuable are the side-by-side comparisons of individual perspectives of the same incidents or challenges.  (How lucky are we, that everyone back then was so prolific with journaling and letter writing?)  The constant emphasis on dietary restrictions and on sexual taboos are enough to get readers thinking about their own eating and lifestyle choices.  The most poignant passages come from Abigail Alcott, Bronson's wife.  This book reveals more intimate details about that marriage than most biographies heretofore have.  Abigail's views of the Fruitlands residency -- before, during and after -- are among the most intelligent and realistic opinions expressed on these pages.  In many ways, the moral of the Fruitlands story could very well be:  "Never underestimate the power of a woman."In spite of the founders' best intentions, the utopia lasted only about six months and accommodated at the most 13 members.  Of course, we now have the benefit of knowing the Fruitlands outcome, and we can watch its individuals advance toward dissolution with nearly every step.  The sad truth is that the little community never came together the way Alcott and Lane expected it to:  if they themselves could even envision what that ideal scene might have been.  The farm ended up being a mere suggestion of utopian possibility and not the embodiment of it.  The blame for failure has to lie with Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane and their do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do attitudes.  They both ended up speaking and writing more about the mission of the experiment than living it and managing it in person.Richard Francis's "Fruitlands" is worthwhile and essential reading for anyone interested in the Transcendental or utopian movements of the 1800s.  In that respect, it could make apt companion reading to Sterling F. Delano's Brook Farm: The Dark Side of Utopia, the history of Fruitlands' closest community competition.  This is hardly a light or casual treatment of the subject, however.  (And as another reviewer has noted, the author provides so much background that the actual farm experience itself is the shortest portion of the book.)  It indeed answers the Who, What, Why, and How queries about Fruitlands:  perhaps with more detail than some readers will be prepared for.
