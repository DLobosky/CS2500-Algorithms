The way it's made, you feel like it's massaging your hand as you walk your dog. It is the perfect length for taking a stroll.Their dogleesh is 8' long and it's very comfortable to use because of the following properties:soft erganomic rubber handlethick gauge nylon webbingheavy duty metal cliprubber bone logo detailThere are 6 different colors to choose from:BlueGrayGreenOrangePinkPurpleYou can purchase your own Dogleesh from Pet Projekt for only $20.
