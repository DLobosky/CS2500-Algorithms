This is a great dvd. If you like nature and animals you will love this film. The footage is just beautiful and will make you want to go to Alaska and see it first hand. This is a very interesting dvd with wonderful narration. It is very educational and perfect for children as well as adults. You will want to watch this again and again. A fantastic dvd to add to your collection. I highly recommend it.
