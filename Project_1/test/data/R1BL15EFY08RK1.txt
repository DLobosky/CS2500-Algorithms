Until his death, Murray commented vigorously on the cultural affairs of the day in the Rothbard-Rockwell Report.  These articles are collected in this outstanding work.  Actually, I use the phrase cultural affairs broadly since these articles concern history, political strategy, movie reviews and more.  With Rotbard you dont get canned bromides like some other would-be deep thinkers, but an exciting and informed opinion on topic after topic.  As just one example, consider the war against the Serbs.  Leftists from all quarters (Hitchens, Lerner, etc.) couldnt wait to go to war against the Serbs in defense of the so-called Bosnian nation.  Murray points out that there never was Bosnian nation (or even a Yugoslavian nation for that matter.)  Likewise, the left  contrary to its supposed representatives -- has never really been in favor of peace; after all Barnes derided the pro war pacifists of his day.  Murray even points out the similarities of the Bosnian Moslems to the old Bogomil heretics of that area (humorously pointing out that the Bogomils were what Ayn Rand falsely considered all Christians to be.)  At the same time Rothbard was writing these essays, he was writing monthly articles on economics in The Free Market newsletter.  Those articles are gathered in MAKING ECONOMIC SENSE.  If years from now someone asks me what really happened in the 80s and 90s, Ill direct them to these two books.
