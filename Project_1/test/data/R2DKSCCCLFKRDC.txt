It comes with doll, tank, and accessories.The tank fills in the front with water and provides the optical illusion that the doll is in water (though she's in a dry compartment behind the small water tank).  When you press the shell button on front, bubbles float up and green/blue lights wink at the same time.  Our instructions says that there are supposed to be several different effects depending on how you press the shell button - but ours only ever did one thing (it turned on).  Mattel quality again *sigh*The fins on Lagoona's legs are particularly loose on this doll and fell off immediately (and wouldn't stay back in).  I didn't want to superglue them in since it would mean my daughter couldn't put pants on her (or off her) with the fins in the way.In all, ours didn't leak, it isn't messy like you would expect with a water toy, and she enjoys it.  But it is a one-trick pony, with quality control issues, and I fear she will grow bored of it quickly.
