I just purchased this UPS from another retailer, so I can't comment on reliability yet.  But here are a few things I noticed:Negatives:* The fancy LCD display goes off after 60 seconds if you don't push any buttons.  No way to make it stay on (unlike the Tripplite G1010USB).* There is no contrast adjustment on the LCD display (unlike the Tripplite G1010USB)* A single momentary press of the large blue power button shuts off your battery-backed equipment.  The whole point of having a UPS is to prevent connected equipment from losing power, but it's way too easy for someone to hit this big blue button and shut everything off, especially when trying to silence the beeper.  Competitors require the power button to be held in for a second or two.)* The output power quality is too poor to cascade to another UPS (not a believable sine-wave approximation).  Other UPS's are similar.* Unlike some APC UPS's, the input sensitivity is non-adjustable (and certainly you can't plug this UPS into another UPS or it'll run from batteries only and the output voltage keeps flickering).* When running from batteries, a loud cooling fan kicks in whether it's needed or not, and continues to drain the UPS battery even if the connected equipment is off.* The output power reading is inaccurate, the display reads 20% lower than the actual power consumption of the connected equipment (i.e. display says 80W for a 100W load).*** Review update:  Just had a 2 second power loss today when a storm blew through, and the "battery-backed" PC got reset.  So even though the UPS seemed to protect against being unplugged from the wall when I first tested it, it did not protect the PC from a random power glitch. The delay switching to backup power was too long for a PC to tolerate and I've lowered my rating accordingly.  A similar PC attached to the CyberPower CP825AVRLCD 8-Outlet Intelligent LCD Green UPS (825VA/450W) did not get reset.  Note that UPS was under only 12% load, and the PC power supply was under 30% load)Positives:* The UPS itself only consumes 6W of line power after the batteries are fully charged and display is off.  Compare to 12W for the Tripplite G1010USB, or 15W for the Belkin F6C900UNV (both lower-capacity units).  At 11-cents per KWH, a 6W device costs $6/year when running 24x7, so you'll save $6-$9 per year (note this is way less than claimed in Cyberpower's marketing literature).* Has an overload reset switch on the back (unlike many other UPS's which just have an internal fuse).
