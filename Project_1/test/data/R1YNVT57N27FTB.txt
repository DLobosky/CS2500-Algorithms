So, when this came out I figured OK, this is what Superman 3 should have / could have been. I went into it with the right mindset and realized that with all new actors and actresses that things were gonna be a little different.  I was actually OK with the casting changes for the most part.  So, where to begin?  The storyline and "plot" were fairly cool with the crystals at the center of Luthers ploy. I enjoyed the scenes where Luther experiments with the power of the crystals.  These objects have been at the centerpiece of the film since the beginning so it was great seeing them being an integral part of this movie....NICE!  Speaking of Luther, Kevin Spacey did a pretty good job with the character.  This version of Luther was a little more sinister and not quite as "witty" as the Hackman versions but this was an acceptable change. Luther in this film was more of a real villian so to speak since he was a "darker" character.Kate Bosworth tried but just didnt cut it as Lois Lane.  That charcater has Margot Kidder written all over it and its not really Ms Bosworths fault... she just couldnt "revive" the Lois character for me. She was not as silly, loveable, or as interesting as the orginal.  What else can I say?  It just didnt work.  Brandon Routh was also a little out of place here. He was off just enough to make me miss Chris Reeve (RIP) and at times he appeared bored with the whole thing.  They could have worked with him more on playing the characters of Clark and Superman as they were quite different and this was missing somewhat in this film.  Routh wasnt awful by any means and he does look a lot like Reeve, it just missed the mark by enough to be noticed.  The rest of the cast was OK, nothing great but nothing terrible either.The CGI and effects were a mixed bag as usual with movies these days.  Some of the CGI worked well and sometimes it just looked like a video game. The problem with CGI is that its just soooooo obvious when its being used that it takes away from the realism of a scene because you KNOW that its totally computerized.  In the old days, we didnt know exactly how things were done so we were able to just watch the special effects and the mystery of how they "did that" kept us guessing.  Now, just about every shot with any kind of effects is CGI and it has that 2-dimensional, lifeless look to it that I have trouble with.  Oh well....There are a few surprises but most you could see coming a mile away. Still though, it did add some intrigue to the Superman saga and how his future may unfold. Plus, the ending is open enough that a lot more could happen and we may even see another film in this series someday.Overall, Brian Singer did a solid job with this film and thats saying a lot since things like this usually never get off the ground and are pretty awful.  Not so, its definitely worth a watch and after seeing it you can decide if its worth adding to your collection.  I might get it just to add it to my Superman 1 & 2 collection.
