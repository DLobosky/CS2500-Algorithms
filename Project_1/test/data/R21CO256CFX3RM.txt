Professor Amar has written a fine book in, "The Constitution and Criminal Procedure".  Overly thin - the critical elements are included, but, not particularly helpful.  Written 11 years ago, it's somewhat out of date.  Tends to read the constitution in much more literal and original terms than most defense attorneys.  Okay.  I wish that it had been more comprehensive and thoughtful.  I'd give this a solid B.  I'd recommend reading some of the newer and more comprehensive and better researched texts.
