When I got them, I thought they felt a little cheap, but that didn't bother me when I put them in my ears.  They were really comfortable and the sound was better than I was hoping for.  I used them daily for about 4 1/2 months and one of the earbuds started to stop making any sound depending on how the plug was positioned in my mp3 player.  It was pretty clear that a wire had either broken in the earbuds near the plug or maybe come loose from its solder.  I emailed the company and told them about the problem I had just so they would know that they had a quality issue.  With no questions, the jlab support person sent me a replacement pair.  I was pretty happy with that.  But 9 months later, the same thing happened.  They died from what appeared to be a broken wire in the same place.  JLab offered me an upgrade to the J2s.I'm giving this model of JBuds a 1 star because the quality was just poor for me to go through 2 pairs in a little over a year.  I should not expect to have to purchase ear buds at that rate.  I'm also giving it 1 star because of the support from the company.  Even though I received excellent service for the malfunctioning two original JBuds, the quality of the company's support seems to have diminished.  I have been trying unsuccessfully for a week to get a resolution on my new pair of J4s that just failed.  I recommend against purchasing these particular ear buds or anything else from this company
