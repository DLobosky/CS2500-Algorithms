A nutritionist recommended this Teddie all-natural peanut butter to me. It doesn't have extra sugar and additives as many supermarket peanut butters have. It's low in sodium, also. Love it on whole grain english muffins or even a spoonful as a snack. It's a great way to eat protein and healthy fat. When you want protein, but are going light on meat, this makes a delicious meal on whole grain toast, muffins, or on a banana or apple or celery for a snack.
