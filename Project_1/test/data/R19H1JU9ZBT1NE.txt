There's 4 segments beyond the warmup/cooldown:  Hip Hop, Latin, Jazz (my favorite), and Ballet.  I'm not a fan of the ballet segment, as Jennifer does not work to the beat of the music and I felt that the movements were a little too fast to be effective.  So I just skip the ballet section and go directly to the cooldown for 41 minutes total.People with carpet will have a Heck of a time doing some of the movements...especially the latin box moves!  There's lots of twisting movements to prepare to modify (or buy some non-treaded dance shoes, which work like a charm on my low-pile carpet).  There's also a bit of impact that is easy to modify.As I said earlier, there's lots and lots of dance moves in this one...I wasn't able to pick it all up the 1st time around, so this will be one to grow with.  And unlike a lot of dance workouts out there, my heartrate got going pretty good!Recommend to intermediates with some dance workout experience.
