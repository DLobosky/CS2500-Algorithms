However, I had a light bulb moment one day that if this product was not greasy enough and my beloved all-natural Burt's Bees product was too greasy, then...So, shortly after every shower, I apply a thin layer of Burt's Bees Hand Salve followed by a dab of the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion which seals it in. The Aveeno is unscented and the combination WORKS! I use the two products every day on my hands, below the knees including my feet and a couple of other places. The dry red patches around my elbows have been long gone. I reduced the rating by one star for two reasons: this product is not all-natural, and it is not greasy enough. It does a great job of sealing in the greasy stuff, though. I am very glad that it is unscented. I am sensitive to many artificial scents. This three-pack will last me a little more than a year when used as I mentioned. For more information, see my review of the Burt's Bees product under the three-pack.
