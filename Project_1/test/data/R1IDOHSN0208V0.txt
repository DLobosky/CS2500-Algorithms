The Thief contains no spoken dialogue.  It was an interesting experiment that really is a dead end. One cannot imagine or desire a whole series of films like this but, as a stand alone, the film is  good.  It fails as a &quot;cold war&quot; film since the viewer cannot really tell who the  &quot;thief&quot; actually is working for. Could be Moscow but could easily  be Egypt.  That said.  The Thief is very watchable.  The direction is  excellent.  The performances are all first rate, especially Ray Milland.  The film really hinges on Milland's silent acting skills and he truly  carries the film. This is a must have for any Milland fan.  One is hard  pressed to think of a film that so completely belongs to a single actor yet  here it is. Milland is commended for taking a chance on such an unorthodox  film.  He succeeds.  The film succeeds.
