I have tried tape backup units, DVDs, and other classic solutions, never with real confidence that my data was stored safely. This 1TB HDD from Seagate really is a superb backup unit. On the competent advice of my IT professional, I bought two of these, one for my business, one for my home office.The unit is very nicely built, with an attractive black finish and it stands vertically.  It has a large orange vertical LED the brightness of which indicates whether the unit is working or on standby.  The unit is very compact. If you need more than one later, you can stand them next to one another without taking up much space. But 1TB is enough storage for a LOT of files. Of course, in a year or two no doubt there will be units of the same physical size that store multiple terabytes. Nevertheless, for now, 1TB is a lot!The unit installed effortlessly. You simply plug it into the power supply, and attach the USB (or firewire) connector to the computer. On my Vista Premium Home Edition machine, a menu came right up asking me if I wanted to install the backup software with which the unit comes equipped. I let it do so, and in a minute or so the software was installed and the 1TB HDD was shown in my Computer directory as ready to go. No need for reading anything; true plug and play. The unit is quiet and unobtrusive; it just does its job without annoying the user in any way. Nice!I did install the backup software, and it seems to be very nice.  In fact, this is the first time in years that I have seen backup software that I thought was better than just doing the backups manually.  One complaint (minor) is that the backup software makes you specify each directory on a drive by checking a box.  I would prefer an option that just lets me back up an entire drive.  No big deal.  The software enabled me to schedule a nightly backup every night, and that is an absolute first for me for my home office.  A very nice feeling to know that one has one's files safely backed up.  And one can easily view the contents of the unit to actually see the backed-up files.This is a USB2 unit, so transfer speeds are not as fast as a SCSI drive would be, but usually this is not an issue with the type of use I plan, as routine backups and storage in increments does not take long. It did take roughly 1 hour twenty-five minutes to move about 34 GB of photo files from my little USB HDD to this unit; that is one USB2 unit to another, so it was bound not to be real speedy.Incidentally, the unit is formated NTFS, so no need to reformat it to get rid of FAT32 format as is the case with some drives. It truly was ready to go for my Vista system.So far I am extremely pleased with this unit. It is a fast, well-built, well-designed and cost-effective solution to mass storage of data.
