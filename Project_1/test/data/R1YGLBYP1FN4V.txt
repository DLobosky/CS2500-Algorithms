I initially bought one of these skins in the regular, shiny finish.  It blinded me with the reading light on.  I replaced it with this matte one, a nice, serene design, and so much better in matte.My criticisms are two.  First, the page turning bars are not cut out.  They can cut out every little key and button for the Kindle3, but not even the four bars for the Nook Touch.  The skin just lays over the top of them in an awkward way.  Ridiculous at this price.Speaking of price, that's my second complaint.  With shipping, this skin is $20.  At least as I write this review, Bundle Monster is selling their skins AND leather cases for $20, and I much prefer their skins because the bars are cut out.  The cases are nice too.  I like to change looks every now and then, so finding these things at a reasonable price is important.  If you don't mind synthetic leather, you can get a set for $15 from Bundle Monster here on Amazon.If you absolutely love the Invisible Defender designs (they have many very pretty ones) and don't mind shelling out unnecessary cash, make sure you go for matte and just understand that your sidebars are going to be buried underneath.  The corners on the back seem to buckle a little on all of these skins, no matter the brand, because the back of the Nook is so rounded.  If you keep it in the case as I do, that doesn't really matter.
