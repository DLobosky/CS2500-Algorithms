It should be stated that for most, the Apple TV is probably the best option, and while not a perfect device, it seems five years ahead of all the alternatives. For those who don't want an Apple TV, either because of the price or because it's like joining a special religion, then this is our second choice for best available product. We really liked the ease of use of this product. Simply remove it from the box, connect it to your television, and connect an external USB hard drive. The media player instantly finds the media on the drive and displays it broken out by category (music, video, photos). The device is small and convenient, and we were happy it only took up 1/50th the space of our annoyingly-large Tivo. The remote was equally simple to use. We found the menu system to be a bit primative and ugly. There are not a lot of options with the WD TV, and while this contributes to its simplicity, it was annoying at times. The device doesn't display any file tags or thumbnails, so users are limited to the name of the file on the drive. I personally am reliant on my Apple TV's ability to support tagging, and found the lack thereof really annoying. Shuffling through my episodes of Alias, I wanted to locate the episode we'd last seen. While my ATV would display episode descriptions (Sidney finds herself lost in Paraguay...), The WD TV simply displays the file name on the drive (Alias S1E22 Broken Ties). NOT as helpful.File support is dodgy at best. We were moderately happy that the device played all file types it claimed to (the Iomega did NOT do this). HOWEVER, we were annoyed that when playing an m4v file we lost the ability to fast forward and rewind. What?! Yep - your M4V files will play, but they won't fast forward, and the device won't remember where you left off, so you better be committed to sitting through an entire program. We finally discovered that we could fix this by changing the files extensions from .m4v to .mp4, which was annoying but worked. We were also quite annoyed that there is no chapter skip for ANY file type. That's right - you can fast forward up to 16x, but if you want to see the extra cool ending to Lord of the Rings (take that Voldemort...um, I mean Sauron!!!) you have to watch the hobbits traipse all the way to Mt Doom in fast motion. We did experience a crash now and again, usually when asking the device to fast forward or rewind quicker than it was capable of responding. If the device crashes, it means unplugging all devices, turning it off, disconnecting the power, turning it on, reconnecting, and resuming your movie. This encouraged us to give the player a little more time before switching from 2x to 4x fast forward, and that seemed to prevent further crashes.Picture and sound quality were decent. Not quite as good as the Apple TV, but substantially better than other comparable media players. Overall, I felt the quality was right there with what our Tivo records off of cable.Overall, this is a pretty good device, but it's not fantastic. It will work for my friend, but I wouldn't personally use it because I like the features of my Apple TV. This device would become more attractive at a $50 price point, but considering that it's $129 retail and you have to go buy an external drive, meh. I look forward to what they come up with in a couple of generations, but this isn't that great a product at this time.Pros: small, sleek, easy to use, plays the files it says it will, ok qualitycons: no chapter select, no file tagging, primitive menu features, overpriced, m4v files have weird issues
