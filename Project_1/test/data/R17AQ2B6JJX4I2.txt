I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl, and though it has been a long time since I listened to it, it is much more tolerable than the CD. Why? The CD sound is a plastic imitation. Ringo's cymbals sound like white noise. The drums are all stick and no skin. Bass is flabby and indistinct (granted, even on the Mobile Fidelity release it is not anything to praise, but the CD is worse). The organ on Harrison's "Something" sounds more like a Casio keyboard than a Hammond. There's a smudging of everything and very little sense of open space around any of the vocals or instruments. I could go on and on, but if anyone can get a superior analog version of this album, they can make their own comparison. I think in almost every category, any trained listener would find the CD sound worse. Yet, I have trepidations about the inevitable remastered versions of the Beatles catalog that are rumored to be just around the corner. When they remade the Let It Be album (Let It Be Naked), the sound had more clarity, but it also seemed dynamically compressed. I could live with it, if they did that to the other albums, but I would not be completely satisfied. Most people will think I am just nitpicking. But good music deserves a decent transfer from the master tape. Comparing the CD with the vinyl, this didn't happen when Abbey Road was transfered to digital. I find the CD convenient, but it is always a strangely unsatisfying experience. The CD gives an impression of this great album, but the unnatural timbres of instruments and electronic quality of the voices deaden the beauty of the songs. If you buy this, just remember that there is more to this album than you will ever hear from the CD. We hope for better... maybe the remastered version. But I may just digitally record my vinyl copy. It may well outdo any future remastering.UPDATED MARCH 2011: The 2009 remaster of Abbey Road is not perfect, but in bass quantity and quality, in smoothness, overall clarity, and organic wholeness of the sound -- it beats the earlier release handily. The 2009 CD remaster even beats vinyl versions I've heard. There are new vinyl releases of this album coming, which may best the CD, but that is just an audiophile hope at this point. In my opinion, the original CD release has little to recommend it. I'll never listen to it again. Go for the remaster.
