This is a wonderfully fun movie, a mixture of humor and semi-seriousness about three people who go to the moon in a machine invented by a strange, very strange, scientist at the turn of the century. Lots of fun, and very enjoyable. You'll like the antics of the eccentric scientist.  At the end of the movie, if you're like I am, you're sure to say "Imperial".
