In Beverly Lewis' final book in The Rose Trilogy series, The Mercy, picks up just right where The Judgment left off. By the way, if you haven't read the previous two books in this series, Beverly provides a prologue that gets the reader up to speed, but trust me, you'll definitely want to go back and read the other two in the series, The Thorn and The Judgment.The story finishes up the stories surrounding Rose and Hen, two sisters that are at a crossroads in their life. For Hen, she struggles with the life she walked away from as she married an English man. Torn between her old ways and her new life, she wants the life of simplicity she found growing up Amish. The problem is that her husband, Brandon has no desire to live that way nor will he stay married to Hen if she insists on remaining at her parents. He will also take custody of their daughter, Mattie Sue if she won't come home. After a devastating accident that almost took, Brandon's life, he's been recovering with Hen and Mattie Sue at her parent's Amish farm. Hoping that God will work on his heart, Hen continues to pray for him and helps take care of him. But will this change of lifestyle and prayer work to heal Brandon and Hen's marriage?Rose is struggling with finding a man who will complete her life now that she has released Silas Good from his engagement to her  to marry Rebekah instead. Only she is still locked to her past, with the only boy she has ever given her heart to, Nick. A boy that has now left the Amish community after the death of his brother Christian. Nick is the adopted son of Bishop Aaron Petersheim and with Nick's absence leaving so many unanswered questions, the Church board wants to silence Aaron for good, taking away his title of Bishop since he can't seem to control his own family, what good will he do for those in the community as a leader of the church. However, Nick has no desire to return home and wants to pursue a college education instead. Will Rose be able to ever forget Nick long enough to find love in her own future?I received The Mercy by Beverly Lewis compliments of Christian Fiction Blog Alliance for my honest review and LOVED it! I love how Beverly completed the lives of the characters she made us fall in love with in the Thorn. Through difficult times, tears and lots of prayer, these characters have become a part of our own lives. I personally felt part of this community as though I spent my life growing up Amish with them. I think that is what makes Beverly's novels so popular. This is now a permanent part of my own personal library and one I hope you'll all take the time to read and enjoy as much as I have. For that reason, this one rates a 5 out of 5 stars.
