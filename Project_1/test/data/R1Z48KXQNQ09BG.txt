This is because as Christ figure Django certainly is not of the "turn the other cheek" variety. Django seems to be surrounded by more Christ symbolism then I can count including a death wielding crucifix in a grave yard showdown(with symbolic red rose bush and Catholic prayer).Very unfortunately Franco Nero's understated anti-hero style acting is completely ruined be thin Casper Milquetoast voice and hokey dialogue and flat sound in the English dubbed version. I found that much of the music in the film was not bad but the opening Django song seemed way over the top to say the least. Morricone is definitely missed.Id recommend only the Blue Underground Italian language only.  In Italian Django sounds fine and the dialogue is vastly improved and more interesting. But it is a bit odd watching a western dubbed in Italian.  Anchor Bay's version looks and sounds only OK but Blue Underground's version looks and sounds great.I gave this film two stars for the Anchor Bay's bland English version.  But Blue Underground's beautiful Italian dubbed version rates 4 stars.
