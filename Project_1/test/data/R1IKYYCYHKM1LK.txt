The main positive point is the high drama and creation of a world that is the version that I kind of wish actually happened.  There ar some points that don't make a whole lot of sense, but these are explained in the history of middle earth series with GREAT DETAIL.  Yet everything that happens in this book that Christopher Tolkien says his father said would not have been possible in the evolution of a planet, I can come up with many reasons that it does work.  It is sad that Tolkien started the lord so late in life, and then when he did start it, it took him like 10 years, and he was bogged down with teaching classes grading papers, and MANY other things.  His main problem was he kept on revising the lord and the appendices over and over again and never had the time to complete the silmarillion.  When he did go back to it he just kept on giving up every 5 years or so because he thought there was no possible way to completely link them together.  This decision to not finish it in my opinion was a good and bad decision.  For one, he was not money hungry whatsoever, so didn't need to push the book out as soon as possible, rather he kept on working on it trying to get it perfect.  I respect him for that but if he could have gotten over his own problem on say the trees and only a couple of other things, just like he left a couple things alone in the hobbit then he would ahve been able to publish this undrr his own name.  The book would most likely have come out in two parts and would have been close to twice as long as this version.  It is very sad that we did not get the right version of this, but Christopher Tolkien certainly made up for this all he could in the history of mid earth series.  And I am certainly very glad that I have finally gotten to read this. By the way this is a really good prequel to the lord, so I know this is unlikely, but you really should read this before the lord, at least that was what tolkien wanted to do, but because they would have had to release at least five books instead of three, money was the factor, so now that you have a chance to read this first, go ahead and experience turin turumbar, beren and luthien, and pick up the history books to get the real version of the fall of gondolin, the hidden city.  I have to get back to work now so you don't have to read any more of this.
