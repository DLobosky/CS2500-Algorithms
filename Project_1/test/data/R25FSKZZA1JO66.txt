Intelligent dialogue, scenic locations and the developing respect and admiration between the two lead characters make this a show worth viewing.The four episodes contain a mix of darkness and wry humor.Series 2 does an excellent job of continuing where Series 1 ended. It's been said that the book series author wasn't particularly pleased with the casting Sharon Small. I haven't read the books yet, but I find Small to have been an excellent choice.Its nice to see that the British are just as conniving, crooked, selfless and rotten as their friends across the pond, more so in all the episodes of the series.
