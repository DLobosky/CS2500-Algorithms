The clarity of the DTS tracks on the first two DVD's is incredible. Signs was a huge let down for me as a home theatre afficionado as there was no DTS track on it.Now I was so looking forward to getting The Village as it is a fantastic movie and I see on the page here that there is only a DOlby Digital 5.1 EX track listed. That is quite surprising and I am hoping someone may read this review that is in someway connected to Vista and may suggest they release another version.There is a reason why Peter Jackson has only a Dolby track on the theatrical releases of all of the Lord Of The Rings movies and then adds a DTS 6.1 ES track on the Platinum Editions you know - it's because DTS audio is far superior.I really hope to see either a special edition of this released at some point or even a Superbit version (Superbit DVD's always have a DTS track on them) so the audio is up to par when compared to Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense.
