Having been to France on several occasions and having the pleasure of living in Paris for a few months I found a lot of the comments and descriptions spot on and quite humorous in a yes that happened to me manner. I will admit that a lot of his description and events are stereotypical and are more of  generalizations of the French, but if you've had the chance of spending time in this wonderful nation you'll be giggling and smirking at the author's description of his experiences as they most likely will have mirrored an event in your own life.  What if your just going to France for the first time?  Well, if your going to France for the first time I would recommend that you do not take this book at face value, but more as a tongue in cheek description of the French, as again many of the describe situations are once in a life events and situations.  I still recommend the book as it is funny and does have a good layer of practical information about what you might expect in and around Paris and France.
