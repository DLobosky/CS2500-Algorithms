Using my schizoaffective deutschaphrenic translation abilities allow me to translate the above product review into English.Thomas, Cranky, and their friends have learned many lessons together.  Come along and find adventures on the train tracks and station house on the island of Sodor. Help Toby and Gordon avoid trouble after they are stranded in a rainstorm.  See how Sir Topham  Hatt  guides trains through the station during freight shipments from Germany. What is that strange cargo they must transport to a secret location deep in the black forest?  With each transport Thomas' motivation diminishes.  His affect flattens and he develops ideations of grandeur.  Eventually the trains formulate a scheme to overthrow Europe and enjoy world domination.
