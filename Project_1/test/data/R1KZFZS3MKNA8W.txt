M. Night Shyamalan's spooky supernatural thriller is one of most chilling and unpredictable films i've seen for a long time. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances, especially Osment, who has the gift of seeing dead people.Director Shyamalan's taut direction makes this one an amazing and thrilling film with that now-famous shocker ending. Add a creepy musical score, some inventive camerawork and a sharp script and you have one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.
