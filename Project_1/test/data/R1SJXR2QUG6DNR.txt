This is one of those fun, new programmable DVDs where you can mix and match the exercises in the order you want, and even do the same segment more than once.  You can customize your workout from the warm-up (4 minutes), power cardio (11 minutes), upper body (12 minutes), lower body (11 minutes), abs & core (11 minutes) and cool-down (3 minutes)  The bonus are Love Your Honeymoon (aka Strip 101), Walk Gracefully (posture tips), and Eat Smart (where I learned I should eat like a bear; i.e., salmon, nuts & berries!)  The pre-programs come from the customized sections; they include "Strapless Dress" which gives you a week's worth of suggested exercises focusing on the upper body (3 days of upper body and 2 days of lower body) and "Hip Hugger Dress" which gives you a week's worth of suggested exercises focusing on the lower body (3 days of lower body and 2 days of upper body.)  This DVD is a keeper!
