The continuity shows, when the children are able to resolve the difficulties of the fairy world and help their great aunt to come to terms with a loss of many years' standing.
 
 The story confronts the issues of parent's relationships with one another, with the loss of people important to one, with the realities of adulthood, and growing up emotionally whole.  It does so gracefully and with panache.
 
 A fun book.
