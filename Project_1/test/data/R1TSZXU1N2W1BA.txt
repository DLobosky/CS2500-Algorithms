This DVD presents the first two episodes (30 minutes each) of the Rurouni Kenshin OVA (miniseries), not to be confused with the theatrical film or the main television series.This DVD (and its companion, Betrayal), presents the backstory of Himura Kenshin (hero of the RuroKen series), during the years of the Imperialist Revolution against the Tokugawa Shoganate (i.e., more than 8 years before the start of the main series).This particular DVD tells how the orphaned Kenshin meets the solitary master of the ancient Hiten Mitsurugi style of Japanese swordsmanship; how the kind-hearted but tormented Kenshin is drawn into the rebellion (against his master's wishes); and how he comes very close to losing his soul as a special assassin for the struggling rebellion. It also recounts how the mysterious young woman named Tomoe comes into his life, and what happens to them when the Shinsengumi (a sort of police force for the Shogunate who are tasked to hunt down and stop the rebels) closes in on the bickering rebel factions.The OVA is very different in style and tone from the main series; subjectively, I can't decide whether it's better or worse (the two stylistic presentations are intended for two different target audiences, I think, and both do their distinctive jobs very well). Objectively, the animation is more detailed, nuanced and realistic. Music and sound are at the same high standard (by the same composer, too, I think), but appropriately more tragic and epic and even understated than what is sometimes found in the main series.These two DVDs stand well together as an independent storyline (it isn't necessary to know, or be a fan of, the main series); and in some not-insignificant ways, the film is better than the comparable live-action American Revolutionary War movie _The Patriot_. There are high standards of realism to the film--no hyper-jumps, or vacuum-slinging swords, but merely extremely realistic swordfighting.The violence level is very high, particularly in the first half of the first episode; but it is in keeping with the central point to the film: no matter how necessary killing may sometimes be, it is still a tragedy that threatens to turn the killer (even with the best of intentions) into a monster. Like many of the best oriental fighting-movies (and like the main series upon which the OVA story is based), the underlying message is actually rather anti-violent. Language is roughly PG-13 material. There is no nudity or sex, although the conversation veers occasionally into 'adult themes' (for entirely good reasons with respect to the plot).DVD production values are competent, though nothing particularly special. English dubbing is very good, and subtitling makes good sense; both are distinctive enough to be worth going through each, but overall I prefer the dubbing. Not being familiar with the Japanese language, I can't gauge how accurate they are to the original, but they fit what's shown very well.It's difficult to recommend when a fan of the main series should watch this. Fans should definitely get it, but it does contain many 'spoilers' about the history of Kenshin. The best time might be after season two of the series.
