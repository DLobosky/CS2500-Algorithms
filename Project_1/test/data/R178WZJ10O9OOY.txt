If there is any &quot;film&quot; I would recommend this year Iwould have to definatley recommend 'DOGMA'. I have been a long timefan of Kevin Smiths' work and this is one of his finest. (Kudos to him and everyone accoiated with this fine piece of work.) 'DOGMA' is not a blasphest film, it is a fanasty and a film on questioning faith itself.  DOGMA opens up aspects to religion and really makes a fanasty that revolves around faith.  After the controversey of DOGMA Kevin Smith stated: 'I respect your ways; why can't you do the same for me?' I close on BUY THIS FILM! (or rent it) and see for yourself at what a excellent film this is.  Snoogians.
