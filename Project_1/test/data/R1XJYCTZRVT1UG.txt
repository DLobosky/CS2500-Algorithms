In one word, this movie is Stunning. It doesn't glamorize war or portray it in anyway to be anything but terrifying, bad and horrible. I do reccomend that you read the book as well though as it gives you alot of background information about the situation and individuals. The acting is great, the camera work is terrific the sound is crystal clear and the picture is very sharp. This movie is very well made and deserves all the praise it gets. You shouldn't think of this movie as an action movie to which you say "Cool!" to when watching it because that's not the kind of movie it was made to be. It shows how heroic every single one of those soldiers who fought on October 3rd and 4th, 1993 were. Soldiers like Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon who were willing to die trying to save Mike Durant and his crew must not be forgotten.
