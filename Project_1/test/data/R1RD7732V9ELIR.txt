The movie very closely mimics the story in the book.  It is about the life of Henry Hill, an associate in the Lucchese crime family.  The movie chronicles Hill's journey through the world of organized crime, starting with a part-time job at a cab stand after school, rising to the heights of stealing millions through participating in robberies and hijackings, then finally how his world rapidly disintegrate after creating a large narcotics empire.  After being arrested for drug trafficking and facing 25+ years in prison, in order to preserve the lives of himself and his family, Hill testifies against multiple associates in the world of organized crime and evaporates into the federal witness protection program.Robert DiNiro and Joe Pesci perform brilliantly, playing blood thirsty, borderline psychotic gangsters.  However, I think Ray Liotta has the performance of his career paying the lead character, Henry Hill, a down to earth gangster who is interested in his women and money rather than killing.  The movie has much less blood than a Rambo movie and very few special effects, yet words cannot express how remarkable the movie is.  To me, one of the best scenes in the movie, the "You're a funny guy" scene in the restaurant, has no special effects at all.This is one of those movies has something for everyone, love, deceit, murder, drugs, corruption, graphic violence, humor, and mystery.  The only issue I have with the movie is that a lot of the details the various crime figures use in their conversations did not mean anything to me until I read the book.  Even though the movie is almost two and a half hours long, the movie does not seem that long.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an excellent drama.  This is one of the few movies I think belongs in almost everyone's movie library.
