"Signs" is M. Night Shyamalan's best movie, and one of my favorite suspense films. It is also so ridiculously underrated! Many people hate it because of its religious aspects, its ending, and it wasn't what they had expected. Come on people! This film isn't about big explosions or special effects. It's about characters that you come to know and care about. That is what makes it a great movie. Great movies are about characters, NOT special effects. Anyway, what I love about this film is the humor that comes from the supporting characters, and it has a sweet and beautiful little girl in it. Abigail Breslin, as Bo Hess, is the kind of little girl you'd love to have as your own. She's so adorable and hilarious, and she pulled my heartstrings at the right moments. I hope she makes more films in the future.
