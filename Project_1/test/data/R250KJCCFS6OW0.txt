Manx's debut, Dog My Cat, was interesting, but it lacked cohesion.  Manx alternated between sounding like Kelly Joe Phelps (warm toned lap slide guitar and smokey vocals), and sounding like a student of V.M. Bhatt on the Mohan Veena (which, of course, he was).  On his second album, Wise and Otherwise, he started to mix blues and Indian influences more, instead of simply alternating between the styles. That brilliant album was also characterized by some sonic experimentation (although mostly acoustic). Then, on a pair of albums, Road Ragas Live, and West Eats Meet, Manx pulled together a truly cohesive sound that mixed the best of everything he had done before. What sets these two gems apart as the best of Manx's recordings so far is the fact that everything just blends together seamlessly. Manx will start out with a KJP-type blues riff, and then emphasize the raga influence on his solos with some of the most subtle and beautiful slide work you have ever heard. Hindustani slide guitarists, like V.M. Bhatt or Debashish Bhattacharya (whom I prefer to Bhatt), understand the importance of microtonal nuances. Sometimes, what really matters is just perfect control over the slide bar on a very narrow range of pitches rather than a flashy riff that includes more notes per second than a human should be capable of playing. Manx applies that principle here, and the result is probably the most beautifully seamless blend of blues and ragas yet recorded. This recording goes side-by-side with Road Ragas as a masterpiece for that.  As another reviewer observes, Manx claims a bit of gospel influence on this album as well, although that influence is *very* subtle, and mostly limited to the back-up vocals.  Those vocals add a nice touch that might have been welcome on Road Ragas, but both albums are outstanding.Further listening: Obviously, Kelly Joe Phelps (specifically, Lead Me On, Roll Away The Stone, and Shine Eyed Mister Zen). For other blends of Indian and Middle Eastern sounds with western forms, try Sandy Bull's Reinventions, Davy Graham's Folk, Blues and Beyond, Jonas Hellborg's The Word or Ars Moriende. With the exception of Graham, they have little blues influence, but they are wonderful examples of the potential to meld Eastern and Western sounds.
