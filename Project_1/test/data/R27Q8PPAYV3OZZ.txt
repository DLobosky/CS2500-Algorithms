I'm very happy with my new round cotton pad dispenser! It has a lid on top for refilling and a opening on the side to dispense the cotton rounds; yet closed enough to keep them free of dust and hair spray. It is made of an attractive transparent durable acrylic material and is easy to clean. The fact that it is clear allows it to match perfectly with any of your bathroom decor. AAA+++++
