I got these in the brown shade, and the light shade of the 1 and 1/2 inch platform is a perfect compliment for the overall shade of the shoe.  These are perfectly paired with so many different shades of blue denim, and if you have denim jeans or skirts in other shades, these shoes provide plenty of possibilities.The gold studs securing the vamp to the platform are just large enough to be eye-catching, and yet still small enough to be subtle (rather than gaudy).  They make a great compliment to the shoe, and you can add to the "subtle yet sparkly" effect by wearing some dangly gold earrings and spangly bracelets.The one and 1/2 inch platform makes these a little easier to walk in.  The shoe features some padding for your feet, but I always add a Dr. Scholz ladies dress shoe gel insert to increase the "comfiness" of heels like these.Again, I love these, but I think Bebe could lower the price a bit.  If the price was more reasonable, then I would have given these a full 5 stars.
