The commanding officer of this destroyer is a Submariner, not a surface sailor (not in my navy).  Later they show a foreign Frigate and identify it as another US Destroyer, once again a submarine CO.  Did the writer, producer, director, ever even hear of the US Navy. let alone interface with it?  Since when does the Modern US Navy run submarines in "Wolf Packs?"Alright, enough about the Navy Bloopers.  Dialog, special effects, script, and everything else is just a waste of time.  Read a book, take a nap, get drunk, just do not waste time on this farce!  Worst movie of the century award should be given.  This movie makes me long for the old "B" Movies of the 60's.
