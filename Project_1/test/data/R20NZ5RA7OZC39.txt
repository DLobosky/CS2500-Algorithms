Second of four in the Twilight Saga, the Young Adult series that rocked the publishing world. Well . . . the world (lol). It may not have entered the household lexicon yet, like the Harry Potter books, but by now, most readers probably have a general idea about the romance of the human Belle and the vampire Edward.Meyer's world building is complex, but quiet. You always get the sense that there is more: the characters exist outside of the pages and you are seeing just a small part of their lives. It is hard to believe that she was a new writer.This book is emotionally intense, as the heroine suffers several losses. But as in the first book, you are so completely engrossed in Belle that you cannot put it down. And the Twilight universe gets a lot bigger in this book, on two fronts.
