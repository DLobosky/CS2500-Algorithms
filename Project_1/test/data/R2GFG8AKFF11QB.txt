And each one is completely different. I am enamored of Rilling's cycle because of the complete dedication he and his performers give to each work the perform. The only people who will not like Rilling are those who insist on period intruments( I have tried Gardiner and one Koopman but find Rilling the best) )I love the booklets that explan each canata and what to look for in them in order to best appreciate Bach's mastery of finding the best way to express the words. Since the BWV numbers are not sequential this disc contains works from different parts of Bach's life. BWV 32 Dearest Jesus My desiring is most marked for it's dialogue between the soprano soul and the bass Jesus which is heart rending even in the recitive passages. Bach modelled this dialogue after Italian  cantata. This should not be missed. BWV 33 Alone to thee Lord Jesus Christ is a chorale cantata in which Bach used a cantata on which the text and music were already in existance. Bach integrates the chorale into a concertante movement to begin using oboes and strings to imitate the melody. Later is one of the most beautiful arias in all of  music. The alto sings for 8 minutes How timidly... is a pleas for the sinner to be accepted by God and is acccompanied by muted violins, plucked pizzacatto really enhance the effect.BV O Fire everlasting is a parody in which bach uses music from other works, this works in other cantatas but not here. Please buy as many Rilling cantatas as you can afford. Please excuse typos i have a neuroloic disease.
