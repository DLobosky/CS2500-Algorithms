So many great reviews on here and after experiencing this Yoga video I now know why so many of Ana and Ravi's videos are receiving such a great response. I had never tried kundalini yoga and have got quite bored from other yoga videos I have tried. This video includes four 19 min workouts plus 2 meditations, very easy to follow (unlike other yoga I have tried)and I love how Ana and Ravi explain how the workout or certain poses optimize the glandular system, etc so you get a real understanding of what it is doing for your body. After only two workouts I felt a difference in my body and I am so looking forward to making this video a regualr part of my day. I am addicted to the relaxing meditations..they truly energize you and give you such a sense of calm and clarity. Having experinced problems with sleeping and emotional stress..I have found this video to be a wonderful sense of comfort and it has left me feeling much more grounded and hopeful at a time when I was struggling alot emotionally. This video can do wonderful things for your body and mind. I love Ravi's soothing voice which is very non intrusive and calming. Ana is a delight. She has a beautiful radiance about her! I was not sure if I was doing the Breath of Fire properly at first as it is something I have never seen before but I am getting the hang of it now and I find I can really focus on it. I think this video can really reshape the body and work well on problem areas. It is such a relief to actually enjoy a workout experience and enjoy it rather than just 'get it over with' which has been my attitude before:) You will be hooked on this video for the pure enjoyment and energy it inspires in you. I have been asking myself where Ana and Ravi have been all my life! Thats how good this video is..I recommend it especially if you are struggling emotionally..it is so uplifting and has been a real blessing to me.
