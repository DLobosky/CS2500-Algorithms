Gay is joined by Linda who shows beginner level and Scott who shows advanced level, while Gay shows intermediate level.  You will need weights and they use a weight bench for some of the chest and back exercises, but those could easily be done on the floor.  Some of the other exercises are seated as well, but could be done standing up.  A step is also used but for the warmup only. Before each exercise is performed there is a brief demostration of the exercise, which is also used for a rest period.  The setting is the same as Gay's The Next Step workout, the music a cross between rock and hip/hop dancy music.After the warmup you will start with lower body exercises, 15 reps are done for each exercise, starting with squats, then static lunges, wide squats (plies), another set of static lunges, then calf raises.  All the exercises are done in a 2-2 count.Upper body is next, here twelve reps are done for each exercise.  Back is first with lat pullovers and one arm rows, then you will move into chest with incline flies and bench presses.  Then you will do overhead presses and side lateral raises for shoulders, kickbacks and lying extensions for triceps.  The tricep exercises are performed one arm at a time, for extra challenge you could do both arms for each, I sometimes do this for a little extra work.  Biceps are next with traditional curls and alternating hammer curls before finishing out with wrist curls for forearms.A brief ab session follows, you will do a short set of traditional crunches, and oblique twists.  Then you will stretch out.Overall, I liked this workout, although there were some minor annoyances.  Gay is the leader of this workout but sometimes seems like Scott is the leader instead as he chimes in a lot with his input and pointers.  He is also the voiceover for the demonstrations.  I personally would have preferred Gay do the talking, but I am usually able to tune this out.The other video is a 20 plus minute stretch routine, it is mainly athletic style stretching.  Here is Gay joined by 2 females, they are dressed in blacy lacy attire.  The setting is quite dark with soft music playing in the background.  Based of one viewing it is nothing spectacular but complete.All in all, not a bad deal for the price.  I like Gay as an instructor and wished that she had more videos available.
