This was filmed on a good suuny day at the Jazz Fest. They sing in "French", but Michael explains every song before they perform it.Even though it's sung in French, you can still understand what they are singing about. If you want to hear something "different" for a change, buy this, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Thanks, and may God Bless!!!
