If you described the basics of the plot to any forward-thinking person today they may think it nearly barbaric.  But Jane Powell more than holds her own in her scenes with the seven backwoods brothers, and the songs and dancing are breath-taking. The barn-raising scene is more exciting than any ensemble dance piece in a movie I can think of.  Bless yore beautiful hide - THIS musical is one for me!
