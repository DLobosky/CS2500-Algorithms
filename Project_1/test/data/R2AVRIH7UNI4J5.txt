Words are given detailed definitions together with explanations of how to use them and example sentences.  Usually this gives much more precise information than would be possible with a translation, and it is also very nice to think entirely in German.  This book is one of my most valued possessions.  I had to get a new copy because my previous copy was so tattered.Now I would like to add a couple of points to what other reviewers have said.First, there is also a very nice software version (unfortunately using Windows).  This makes searching a lot faster.  In addition, it has a really cool feature called "Pop-Up Search".  When this is enabled, if you are reading any German text on your computer, you can right-click on a word, and the dictionary entry will appear in a bubble.Second, although this dictionary is pretty big, there are many German words which are not in there.  (Indeed, German has more or less infinitely many words, since you can keep sticking words and prefixes together to make bigger and bigger compounds...)  So as a backup you might also want to have a really big translation dictionary, such as Collins Unabridged --- or if you are advanced enough to use it, a real German dictionary such as Duden.Conclusion: I recommend using this dictionary as soon as you know enough German to be able to use it.  Look words up in here first, and if you can't obtain the information you need, then try a big translation dictionary.
