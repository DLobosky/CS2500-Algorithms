The book itself is 48 pages and is chock-full of photographs and illustrations, which is the typical Osprey format for this type of book. Not counting the experimental models, prototypes, and planned models that weren't completed in significant numbers during the war, the French developed and deployed three tank models during the war: the Schneider CA, St-Chamond, and the Renault FT. Mr. Zaloga covers all three tanks detail. (The problem with such a slim volume as this one is that the author has to distill a great deal of detail into only a few pages. To his great credit, the author was able to successfully pull this off, and do so in such a way that I didn't feel that I was only getting a cliff-notes version of history.) I learned a great deal about French tanks and their development from this book. The driving force for French tank development, for example, was an artillery colonel named Jean-Baptiste Eug&egrave;ne Estienne, and he played a large part in convincing the French military and political powers that tanks could be key in helping break trench warfare. (Col Estienne is now known in France as "The Father of the Tanks".) The author discusses the development of the Schneider tank, which was the first tank fielded by the French, as well as the St-Chamond, which was basically a bureaucratic answer to the Schneider, and was developed by people far divorced from the realities of the front. As could have been expected for such a new weapon system, both tanks were plagued by numerous problems and faults, some of which were incapable of being corrected. Mr Zaloga spends the majority of the book discussing the one truly successful French tank of the First World War, the Renault FT. As opposed to the much larger and heavier Schneider CA and St-Chamond, the Renault FT was designed as a light, more easily manufactured tank. Part of the problem on the battlefield is that with fewer, slower French tanks, the Germans could concentrate a lot of firepower on each individual tank. With the Renault, French thinking was that with many more light tanks, they would in effect be attacking the Germans with a "swarm of bees", being able to flood their defenses with more targets than the Germans could successfully engage. The Americans were also impressed by the Renault, and eventually produced their own versions. I would have liked the author to have included more operational discussion and analysis of the tanks, perhaps with some quotes or summaries from people who fought in or against them. Undoubtedly he was unable to include such information because of the tight page constraints in this series. Overall, I give this book five stars. As Mr Zaloga notes at the beginning of his bibliography, there are only a few books in print in English about the French Army in World War I, and even fewer about French tanks (although there are plenty of such books if you happen to read French.) Most of the "tank" books you see on this time period are about the British tanks, even though the Renault FT was the most produced tank of World War I. This book fills a large void in armored development and usage in WWI, and has whetted my appetite to learn more ... too bad I can't read French!
