This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see--it draws you into the world of the West Memphis 3 Case, a true story which is not over yet. One young man is on death row &amp; 2 others doing life sentences because of a modern day witch hunt called &quot;satanic panic&quot; very similar to the Salem witch trials of history. If you ever thought Salem can't happen again in this day &amp; age--see this film! Basically, these kids were railroaded for the brutal murder of 3 young boys   because they wore black clothes &amp; liked Metallica (who let the filmmakers uas their songs as a soundtrack for free). Its also amazing because its all the REAL people, the real trial, everything is real, no actors. To top that, the guy who probably DID do it is the dad of one of the victims &amp; is featured prominently in BOTH films! (There is a sequel to this that continues the story further, just shown on HBO.) There is also an excellent website, overflowing with actual documents, huge amounts of data to wade through: &quot;Free The West Memphis 3&quot;.. This film, its sequel &amp; the website are all a TRUE CRIME lover's Paradise Found! This is a truly great documentary &amp; a very worthy &amp; fascinating cause.
