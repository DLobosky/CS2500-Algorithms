YesDid she enjoy all the pictures or artwork throughout the book? YesDid she understand the meaning of what the book was about when wediscussed it afterwords? YesDid she ask me to read it again? YesMy daughter and I both enjoyed this book. We are loving all the artwork and the story. The author writes themes with a child in mind. Easy for them to comprehend and enjoy at the same time.
