But it's like they never thought of how it would actually work. I have ONE cat-- and two children. That's it. I vacuum a couple of times a week. I couldn't make one full pass through the house without the filter clogging with dust. Just awful. And the hair and dust sticks to the filter-- it doesn't drop into the canister-- so it's like a giant dustball right up near the top, until you empty it, which is every five minutes. It stops picking up any pet hair after the filter gets clogged-- now, I didn't say that the canister is FULL-- it gets clogged way before the canister is full. It's a terrible filter design-- and everything sticks to it-- it's almost like you need a replaceable filter for this vacuum every time you use it. This vacuum isn't worth five dollars, much less $50. I wish I could post pictures so you could see what I mean. This vacuum is awful! Don't waste your money!
