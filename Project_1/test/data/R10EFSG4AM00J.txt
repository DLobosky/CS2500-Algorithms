This was one of the books we used in a course I had back at Columbia University and I've kept using it ever since.  The maps are wonderful, the insets about the society are great, and the pictures both drawn and photographs of surviving artifacts are very useful.  I plan on using the updated version of this for my own class on Egyptian history.
