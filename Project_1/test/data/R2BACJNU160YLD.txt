I think these were on sale for around 80 or 90 for the pair. They are very retro modern and as comfortable as any stool. I was worried about the smell after reading previous reviews and was pleasantly surprised that after being unwrapped, the small fumy smell quickly dissipated. They arrived very fast from San Diego to San Jose and were easy to set up and use. They feel sturdy and have very minimal give at full height. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting an affordable modern bar stool. They look amazing and the quality is well above what you would normally receive for a 50/per stool buy. I also purchased the camel color pairs with the same result. Hard to give anythine a 5/5 but these came very close
