The author has done the English-speaking world a great service in providing the necessary grounding in Islamic culture and military capacity along with the Mongols to truly understand their eventually successful struggle against the series of crusades from the 11th to the 14th centuries.  This is not an history of the crusades in terms of dates, leaders and battles, but rather a study of all the fundamental factors in Muslim society, including economic and political structures, that produced the military forces that fought against the crusades.  At the same time, however, it must be remembered that Muslims were a minority in many of the lands where the crusader battles were fought, and they had to contend with large Christian populations in their midst.  Today, of course, these populations have been largely eradicated, some in part due to the crusades which highlighted their danger to Muslim overlords where previously they had been looked upon as little more than cattle.     This book is divided into two parts, the first covering the Muslim states, and the smaller second dealing with the Mongols and their impact.  The unnumbered chapters contain the following subjects: The Military Technological Background; The Cultural, Political and Military Context; Recruitment; Organization; Flags, Insignia and Music; Motivation and Morale; Laws of War; Strategy; Tactics; Combat Skills and Training; Military Equipment; Distribution; Manufacture, Trade and Strategic Materials; Fortification; Siege Warfare; Pyrotechnics and Chemical Warfare; and Communication, Transport and Support Services.     Once again, there is so much good here I don't know where to begin.  The author's writing style is excellent, and he packs a great deal of information into a very few sentences.  One must read carefully and have a pencil handy to highlight the many seminal facts or discussions for future reference.  All of this information is critical to understanding medieval Islam, its leaders and armies, and how and why so many things happened the way they did during the crusades.  I recommend, however, that this volume be read in conjunction with Volume I so that the reader can gain comparative knowledge between the warring factions.     Even if the reader's interest is not primarily medieval history, the knowledge to be gained from these two works is applicable in part to our current day.  The institutions and military organizations and equipment have changed, but the religious conflicts and attitudes between the warring parties have not.  European attitudes towards Islam have softened somewhat, but Muslim feelings towards Christians (and Jews) have hardened.  At the time of the crusades Islam was still expanding, and after a long period of stagnation, Islam is expanding once again.  To a large degree the crusades were the original conflict between Catholicism and Islam, as the earlier Muslim conquests were made primarily against Orthodox Christians considered heretics by the Roman Catholic Church.     I highly recommend this work (actually both volumes) to everyone interested in medieval history, the crusades, of the modern conflict between Islam and the West.
