Someone as clever as Elton John, with such an acute sense of song structure, is poorly served by genre songs collection. Like his pop music forebears, the Beatles, Elton mixed loud and soft, fast and slow, campy and  sentimental to form his musical persona. His signature songs here  (&quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Daniel,&quot; &quot;Someone Saved My Life  Tonight&quot;) are best heard within their original albums (or 1974's  Greatest Hits collection, which fit the same mold). The live remakes  (&quot;Candle In The Wind,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On  Me,&quot; both Top 10 hits) seem hammy compared to the already grandiose  originals. By the time Elton got back to basics with &quot;Believe,&quot;  &quot;Blessed,&quot; and the two new songs, the damage was done. No one  needs more soft ballads, especially a collection of them, from Elton John.  Instead, the rockers from his long career should be gathered to remind us  (and him)of all Elton John hoped to be as a performer -- and for the better  part of 20 years, was.
