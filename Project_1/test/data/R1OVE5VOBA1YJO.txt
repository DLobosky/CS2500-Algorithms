I love these mini LPs from Japan. I also love the Count Basie Band. But our friends from Japan messed this one up, and it is among the worst of this series. First, the original Roulette label used for the CD face is the orange and yellow edition, which is NOT the original red, yellow, blue & green bars over white label. Second, the sound is not the beautifully restored sounds you will get from the Mosiac Records box set.  Instead, it is an older master which was used on the 1987-1988 Vogue releases from France. The biggest mistake is the the first two and a half beats of the song RAT RACE are MISSING!  Hopefully (but I doubt it will happen) the Japanese company will re-release the ENTIRE line of Basie Roulette recordings (and Maynard too, please!) and get it right the second time around.
