He urges readers to learn that you are still teachable despite aging & certain regrets.This is not the best text covering this subject but it is helpful & clear...and of course written by one of the most respected ministers of the gospel of our time.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.
