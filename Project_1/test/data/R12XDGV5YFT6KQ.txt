This recording was reissued on Vanguard (Netherlands) CD in 1996 with a totally different cover.Journal of Book of Mormon Studies: Volume - 8, Issue - 2, Pages: 4-13. Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 1999: New York City, 1961: Vanguard, VRS 1077, featuring the Utah Symphony, University of Utah Choruses, and soloists: Roy Samuelsen, Kenly W.
