While I value many of the features of QPunctureII, this one simultaneous excels in its study tools for students and in its value as a reference for more experienced practitioners.  There are expanded sections detailing out the anatomy of critical landmarks such as the spinous processes, ribs, and other bony landmarks.  Provides solid coverage on precautions to take when needling near organs.  Contains both point by point information plus details of the major meridians, extraordinary points and chinese names.  Multi-media features include brief very good resolution videos and chinese pronunciation of point names are available at the touch of a link for every point.The highlight is in its flexibility as a study tool which allows one to practice locating points by identifying body region and then underlying key anatomical structures like one would feel under the skin depicted in the next deeper level of the drawing. (I wish it allowed one more optional layer for clarifying location of nearby nerves, blood vessels and gave the names of muscles -- with someway to rehearse these as well).  Practice tests can be configured as needed for studying particular meridians.  I especially like being able to contruct my own point combinations as desired for treating particular illnesses or regional pain problems.  One can focus this process to rehearse Chinese names, too.   The testing features makes studying so much more meaningful -- helps one identify where additional work is needed and builds confidence.  Given that every school seems to have a few of their own "special" pearls or point variations to learn -- it is extremely important to find a means to add in notes as well.  This program allows you to do so.  Deadman's Textbook/DVD multimedia program has already proven to be one of my favorite essential resources.  I expect it to be a companion for a long to come.  Physicians acupuncturists will need to be mindful that the points are understandably determined by WHO international nomenclature, and there will be small variations in preferred locations for some individualized purposes.I continued to be fascinated and awed by the healing potential of acupuncture.  This program supports my ongoing explorations in a very satisfying way.
