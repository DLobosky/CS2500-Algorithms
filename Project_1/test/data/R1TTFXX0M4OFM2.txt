I love this book because for the money you really can not beat getting 101 projects (or 106 projects if you get this book from Barnes and Noble) .... as with any craft book there are patterns I will not use (like the Spats!), but overwhelmingly there are a lot of great patterns in here that I cannot wait to make! Some that I am looking forward to making are: tabletop ironing board cover, cottage apron, oven mitt and hot pads, wineglass coasters, all-you-need sewing kit, sewing machine cover, collapsible shopping tote, strapless belted tunic, bias skirt, summer nightie, flouncy bag, folklore bag, scrunchie bag, festive flag banners, cuddly bear cushion, Elodie the Elephant, "Olivia the Owl" (barnes and noble copy), and the "Cat Crinkle Sack" (barnes and noble copy).   I have  made two project thus far (the "not ugly car trash bag", and the "peg bear"), and both were really easy to make and turned out awesome.  The directions for this project were very easy for me to understand, and as I said I am very new to sewing.  Some great features of this book are: nice color photographs, spiral bound so it lays flat, great how to and resources section, and also a diagram of how to lay your pattern pieces out on your fabric (which all sewing books should have in my opnion!).  The patterns are divided up by function ... for example "Household Affairs", "Carry It All", "Playtime", etc. As I also hinted at earlier,  if you get this book at Barnes and Noble (like I did!), you actually get 5 extra bonus patterns that are not included in other editions for a total of 106 patterns ... the extra patterns are for a stuffed owl,  a baby doll carrier, a clothespin bag, a cat crinkle sack, and a bicycle duffle bag.  I thought it was worth it to buy the book at Barnes and Noble for the extra patterns.  There are some aspects that I wish were improved.  In the "Outfit Your Small Wonder" section of the book, all of the patterns except for a newborn jacket are for girls.  I have 3 boys, so it would have been nice to have at least one pattern for boys.  But, my major gripe would be the super cheap way they have the paper patterns stored.  As you can imagine, with there being 101 projects in the book there are A LOT of paper patterns.  All of these brown paper patterns are crammed into this small envelope that is stuck to the inside of the book cover with a small bit of glue.  You have to pull the envelope off in order to get to the patterns, and once you do that the envelope will not stick very well anymore.  This could have been really improved by having some type of permanent pocket attached to the cover (like other sewing books do) to store the patterns.  And once you pull out the patterns, because the envelope is so small, it is nearly impossible to get them all back in.  But, my complaints are minor, this is a great book.  I understand that there may be some errors in this book ... you can go to the publishers website ([...]), and there are corrections on the site for 3 or 4 patterns.A great book!
