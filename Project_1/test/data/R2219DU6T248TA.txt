During the war, Morison served on some 22 ships and was present at many of the operations he would later write about. As a result of this unparalleled access to the principals on the American side, much of it during the actual war, Morison was able to really put readers inside the minds of the American commanders. Morison also had early access to extensive intelligence debriefings of Japanese officers captured at the end of the war and to the collection of documents that became the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSSB).In addition to the access Morison's writing style is still fresh after all these years. Although he is definitely a partisan of America, he is fair to the Japanese (remarkable fair given the fact that he was writing in the late 40s). The fact that he personally knew the officers on the American side is transmitted to the reader through the writing in a way that I don't think I've seen anywhere else. Sometimes it's as if Morison were writing a chatty letter about the doings of the various alumni to other members of the same class.This volume is no exception. Morison does an excellent job of putting the reader in the early days of WWII. After the grimness of the previous volume, relieved only by the ray of hope provided by the Doolittle Raid, the reader of this volume can gradually see the tide start to turn. First at Coral Sea, where the Japanese plans to expand their empire to Port Moresby are thwarted and the Japanese navy is handed its first strategic setback. Then a slew of frustrating submarine patrols where intrepid skippers are let down by faulty torpedos, but great things are promised once those issues are fixed. Finally, Midway! Where Ray Spruance ambushes Nagumo and sends all four Japanese carriers to the bottom in the first installment of the payback for Pearl Harbor.  But, as the man says, "wait there's more!"Obviously, being largely written in the 40s and 50s, the books are somewhat dated. They have virtually nothing about the Allied use of ULTRA or MAGIC for instance. This issue is dealt with by the outstanding feature of the newly published USNI Press edition of the books, the inclusion of brand new introductions for each volume. The new intros, written by outstanding current naval historians, introduce the volume, provide a survey of the current state of scholarship on the topic of the volume and finally place Morison's work in context of current scholarship so the reader know explicitly where Morison has been superseded.The intro to this volume was written by Jonathon Parshall, co-author of Shattered Sword, now regarded as pretty much the current state of the art on Midway. Parshall provides a fairly detailed analysis of current scholarship including his own book and Peter Smith's Dauntless Victory, among others. Parshall also chronologically traces the evolution of scholarship on the battle. With this introduction Morison is almost "made new again" because reader not only get to read his exciting and compelling writing, but also know where further developments in scholarship have provided more information. Hats off to the USNI for including them!
