It carries the audience through the twentieth century from the early days of Progressive-era globalization to World War 1, an event that would destroy global economics until the 1990s.  Keynesian economics, the system of regulating the economy, is addressed, as are the challenges that it brought in the 1970s (stagflation).  It shows how the core of ideas has shifted from control to free markets, from socialism to capitalism.  Now the main challenge in the era of globalization is to work towards a fairer market, one where "common" citizens can play an active role in investing, finance, and shareholding.UPDATE:  As of June 2006, I now consider myself a democratic market-socialist.  I believe that workers should own most medium and big businesses, but trade the products on a relatively free, globalized market.
