I swear my life's quest has been finding a pair of suitable headphones/earphones to excercise in. I saw these and I thought...oh SONY! Perfect. Except no. When they weren't falling off my actual head, the buds refused to stay in my ear. They were so flimsy. Not quality like I would have expected of Sony. Maybe one day I will find some headphones....
