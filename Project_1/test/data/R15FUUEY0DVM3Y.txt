

Fight Club MUST be seen twice to be truly understood. Can't say more than that, it would ruin the fun.This film was way ahead of its time in its devastatingly exact portrayal of the emptiness of its time. Give this puppy a few decades and it will be seen as perhaps the finest celluloid expression of millenial ennui/nihilism. The violence is entirely necessary to the experience, and this isn't the standard defense-industry-sponsored Hollywood Gun Porn; it's straight-up bare-knuckle brawling, and its visceral point hits home hard. In the anesthetized homogenized consumerist vacuum of a culture that we call home, it takes at least a few solid shots to the jaw to begin to wake up from our American Dream/Nightmare.Fight Club was widely panned upon release, and no wonder. This is one of the most subversive major studio films of all time, intelligently deconstructing modern film and the entertainment/distraction industry in general. Fight Club's heroes blow up the headquarters of credit card companies (!) in a decidedly unapologetic way...not really the message our Feudal Lords wish us to ponder while being entertained. Why not buy a copy on your Mastercard just for kicks, but whatever you do don't burn it for everyone you know just because the message of this film is more important than making money for the system this flick slams at every turn.So many hidden details, so much black humor (the Ikea lifestyle catalog scene is brilliant), three excellent lead performances, tremendous writing (Palahniuk must have been thrilled with the adaptation), a wild score, state of the art editing, sets, and direction, and so much more.But, and this can not be overstated, you absolutely have to see it twice; the second viewing is a completely different animal, and will make you realize how thoroughly manipulated we are by modern culture, no matter how above and beyond it we think we may be.For a culture constantly and adoringly staring up its own ahole, Fight Club is a satisfyingly violent enema.
