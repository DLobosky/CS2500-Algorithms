Warning-some spoilers ahead.This is an excellent entry in the series and a great return after the disappointing Halloween III,that had nothing to do with the Myers storyline whatsoever.It's great to see Dr.Loomis return,but  best yet,Mike's return!  He really steals the show in this one.The killings  are quite gruesome and Mike is really strong in this one (he actually  ripped a guys neck apart and drove his fingers into another!) George Wilbur  is great at playing Myers and is right up there with Dick Warlock.The  special FX are pretty good and the end battle terrifying.The plot is great  and the story and script is pretty good.The ending is quite creepy and is  sure to creep you out.Overall,this is an excellent entry in the series and  a true classic.Still not as good as the first and not as good as part 2,but  still awesome! BUY IT! Rated R-contains gory violence, some bad language  and a scene of brief nudity.
