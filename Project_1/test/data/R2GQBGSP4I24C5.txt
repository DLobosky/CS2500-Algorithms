I loved those books. My husband did too. They don't make those anymore. Now Nicole O'Dell has come along with something even better for my daughters! She is developing this series of books called "Scenarios" where she has a wonderful storyline in each book with great characters and then about 9 chapters into the book the main character is presented with a dilemma and they have to make a choice. You are then instructed to make your choice and then turn to the corresponding page. You then read the next three chapters where the consequences are played out accordingly. Then there are 3 more chapters with the alternate ending.I love these books! In the first one there are 4 best friends starting 8th grade and having weekly Friday night sleepovers. They start playing Truth or Dare every week and eventually Lindsay is dared to do something she knows she shouldn't. One of the friends says she has to do it or she's out of their group. Does she risk her morals or her friends?So glad to see that Nicole has started this series!
