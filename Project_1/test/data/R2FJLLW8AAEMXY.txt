I really liked the first two books to this series. I couldn't wait to read this one.  This book finds former art thief, Tom Kirk in a race to save The Mona Lisa. It seems that someone is after it, and the only way to protect it is to steal it himself.  Who can Krik trust? Can he trust old friends? I don't want to say to much about this book. If you go into it not expecting to much, you may like it  more than I did. It was kind of a let down for me.
