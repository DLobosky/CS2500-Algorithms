Some of the problems that plagued the first novel still apply to Cast in Courtlight. Mainly, there is not enough information. Everyone knows more than the main character, and even if the main character somehow figures something out she never shares it with us. For example, say there are two characters, one says, "I have a big secret." The other says, "Oh it's about the-" That is how this novel works. Kaylin will figure something out, but she won't spell it out for us. I do enjoy novels where you have to pay attention to every detail and actually think, but this one still leaves out just a bit too much for me. The good thing is that there are tons of things left to find out about, and plenty of reasons to continue the series. The characters are still as interesting as they were in the first novel, though what drives my interest is their mysteriousness. Everyone has a past and is not sharing it, everyone has secrets that they aren't telling. The characters are almost completely defined by what they are not saying. Another issue I had with the first book was the lack of mystery. After I put that book down I stopped considering this a mystery series. It is just fantasy. There may be something the characters are trying to discover, but there is no typical detective work to be found here. Now that I know not to expect it, it is no longer an issue.As I touched on earlier, this series is definitely unique. I enjoy the setting, the fiefs, the races, the characters, the intrigue, the buildings, and everything else. I also enjoy Kaylin as a character. She may have tons of untapped power, but she doesn't know how to wield it, and that makes her more believable and realistic. She is short tempered, but not without reason. If everyone acted like they knew something you didn't and they never explained it to you because they thought you couldn't understand, you would be irritated too. Still, even without help she is pretty intelligent, and figures things out quicker than I ever could. I would give this novel a five if it were not slow in sections. The fighting scenes bored me as well as some of the dialogue. With a little more ironing out this series could be great, and I hope it becomes great. I can't wait to find out more.
