I bought them to use with the Melissa and Doug folding dollhouse, and I like the way they fit with the furniture and in the house. At 2 1/4" tall, they are smaller than the two dolls that actually come with the house, but I think I like them better.Each doll will stably stand, or when you swivel the lower part of the body you get a stable sit position. The painting is good, they are wood, and they seem very durable. So now when there is any emergency at my folding Melissa and Doug dollhouse, I have the dolls just right for stepping in to help!
