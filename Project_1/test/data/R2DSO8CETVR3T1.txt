I am very impressed with the speed of my upgraded PC!I know the review is supposed to be about a Crucial SSD, but before describing how I used it, let me clarify my configuration.First, I bought an 120GB Intel SSD. After transferring the entire system to it, I was left with with about 60GB free. All storage intensive data (songs, pictures etc) are now stored on a the old re-formatted HDD.The Windows 7 disk performance jumped to 7.2, being now better than the performance of my NVIDIA Geforce 9600 video card (6.9) and better than my 8GB RAM and my dual core 3GHz processor performance (both at 6.5). The systems boots in a few seconds and all applications open visibly faster.I'm using Photoshop a lot (installed on the system drive) and, since I was so impressed with the improvement achieved by this SSD, I decided to buy a second smaller one (64GB) to be used as a dedicated Photoshop scratch disk. I chose Crucial since it was cheaper, Intel didn't have less than 80GB options and the performance is equivalent.Now, my Photoshop not only loads faster but it actually runs faster. I'm happy with the improvement.So, before buying a new motherboard, a new processor or a new video card, do yourself a favor and get a SSD first (Intel or Crucial since I cannot tell the difference). You'll not regret it!
