I've tried the earlier Motorola, the S9 ROKR, a Jabra and one of the "wire hook with tiny peg for the ear" models, and this one is my favorite.  Is it bigger than most bluetooth headsets?  Yes, but still tiny enough to conceal in the palm of your hand.  It it heavier than newer sets?  Not by very much.What puts the HS850 ahead of the others I've tried is this:  it's comfortable.  There's something about the ear hook's texture that is exactly what the human ear needs.  It has a hard plastic arch along the outer edge to hold it steady, and the soft arm feels almost exactly like the cartilage your ear is made from.  It's perfect in that it holds fairly tight but doesn't make your skin heat up and throb after an hour with it on.  Buttons for volume are easy to access and powering the unit on is as simple as flipping open the mic arm...this also means it's harder to accidentally leave turned on, or to forget to turn the unit off.Battery life is fairly strong in that you can talk steadily for two hours and still have time left over for a phone call or two before having to charge.  Charging is also fairly quick, often completing fully in less than an hour.  However, charging is the real weak spot of this headset.  First, there isn't really much of a warning when the battery is low.  The lights don't seem to provide me with any idea, and once the unit starts softly beeping in my ear, I usually only have a minute or two left to shut it off.  Second, the connector for the charger is difficult to use:  the release button needs to face the underside, and you have to pinch hard to get the release to let go when charging is done.This isn't the most elegant of headsets, but if you prefer quality to style, you can't go wrong. I've purchased more than one headset in this series and will probably still do so again if I need a new one.
