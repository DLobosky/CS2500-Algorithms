So you know it was a given that I would snatch up the Tekken 6 as quick as possible. But after playing it for a couple of days, I'm finding myself wondering what a lot of people are probably wondering: Was this worth the sixty bucks? Anyway, here is what I've learned so far.The GoodOne thing I can give Tekken 6 credit for is that its brought some new stuff to the table. Granted, I didnt get a chance to play Tekken 5, but I have every other title and I can say that Tekken 6 is waaaaaaaaaay different then any of its predicesors. The biggest draw to the new stuff is the online stuff. Just as with any fighting game in the next gen. systems, there is the online 1 on 1. I love it, thats one of the biggest reasons I bought it. So far its worked great. Very little lag, decent matchmaking time, and a great ranking system. But aside from that, there are a plethora of offline modes for you to mess around with and enjoy. The campaign mode, essentially a combination of Tekken Force and Story mode, is way deeper then any of the individual character stories in the past. This incorperates everyone into it, one way or another. Also, the character customization, always fun, although I was hoping that this time around we could make our own player, but guess not. New moves, great soundtrack, 40 characters to fight with (old and new), decent voice acting, beautifully rendered and fully interactive stages (my favorite is the stage where you can kick around the sheep), and characters. Bottom line here, the graphics are gorgeous, just as expected. There is enough here to keep you busy for quite a while.The BadHey, the perfect Tekken game was too good to be true. One of the more minor gripes I have with this game is something you find immediately when you open the player select: all 40 characters are available as soon as you pop the plastic off the case. I've always enjoyed the part of fighting games were you unlock the characters by various methods. That was part of the fun. Personally, I think that was a vital part they should have kept. The only consolation to this is that in campaign mode, you are essentially unlocking them in order to use them in THAT mode. Not a good trade off to me. One big thing that I notice about this game is the difficulty. I can honestly say this is the hardest Tekken game I have ever played. I had to drop it to beginner to get the rust off, but even then I'm gettin my butt handed to me, and I'm pretty decent at this. Most notably, the final boss is by far the hardest to beat. I have YET to beat him, its almost impossible! If you've every played Street Fighter 4, its just like fighting the final boss there. Its absurdly hard. Speaking of which, much of this game reminds me of SF4, but I digress.My last big gripe about this is for the Xbox specifically. A lot of poeple have said this, and I fully agree: this game is NOT meant to be played on an Xbox control. Niether the D-pad or the joystick work well enough to execute the moves desired exactly the way you want them to. This makes winning critical matches extra hard, and freakin frustrating. Not much we can do about it, but its just something to be aware of. If you have a choice, get it for the PS3, the controls feel much more natural.So at the end of it all, do i think that the game was worth the money? *hesitation* yes, I do. Its a great game for what it is, and lord knows if you get a room of Tekken fans on it, it's fun for hours on end. If you can get past some of the stuff listed above while you playing alone, then you'll be satisfied. A must have for Tekken fans, a maybe for fighting game fans in general, and a rental for newbies. Hope this helps a little for yall still on the fence about it. Peace
