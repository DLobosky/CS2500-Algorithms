Erben engaged Miro in numerous private discussions at the artist's house in Mallorca.  With many interesting insights into his work.  Indeed these discussions provide us a fascet of the artist beyond his art work.  And the reader comes away from these lenthy conversations lokking at Miro's art with a new perspective..  It is done well.But what is somewhat confusing is that the artwork reproductions which are interspersed on the pages have nothing to do with the discussion at hand.  So the reader is following a discussion about one phase of the artist's life while viewing art from decades later.  Yes there are notations on the page about the particular work.  But somehow not fully satisfying.  If I may be so bold; I would have arranged the conversations en-total at the beginning of the book and the plates all together in the second half of the book.A BIG plus in this book is the quantity of late period reproductios.  Dozens of reproductions from the 1960's & 1970's.  Good color quality in large format.  Very satisfying.So all in,all it is a good book worth the amazon price.But not THE Miro book.
