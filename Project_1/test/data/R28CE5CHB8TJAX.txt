This is a very fine study on Katharine Hepburn's films, loaded with photos plus cast (and role) credits, crew credits, synopsis, and quotes from contemporary reviews to Hepburn's films.  An excellent opening biography chapter is included as is a credits and photo section detailing Hepburn's stage career.  The book is capped with a complete list of Hepburn's Oscar nominations (and fellow nominees for those years) and an additional photo gallery.  This book was first published in 1971 so many editions go only up to 1969's "The Madwoman of Challiot" with a photo of her latest project (1971's) "The Trojan Women" - this edition was not updated until the late 1980's.   This is a wonderful book to have at your side when watching a vintage Hepburn film and wanting to know more about the film or who played what role.  Homer Dickens was easily the best writer in the Citadel "Films of" series in my opinion.
