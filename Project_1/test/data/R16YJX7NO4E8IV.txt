I bought this 2Gb RAM module for a Toshiba netbook NB505-N508BN from Arch Computer trough Amazon. It was easy to install and worked fine. Its been 6 months since and it is still working ok. Only thing I didn't like is the item description said: "Toshiba - Memory - 2 GB - SO DIMM 200-pin - DDR2 - 800 MHz / PC2-6400 - unbuffered - non-ECC [ASIN: B001E241TY]", and the item WAS NOT TOSHIBA brand!. But it was a known brand (I think Samsung) and worked fine, so I kept it. Shipping was fast and the price was right. So in the end, I am happy with my purchase!*** Update ***NOTE: Two types of DDR memory are used in the Toshiba NB500 and NB505 netbook series. In order to upgrade, you WILL NEED to determine the current memory speed of your Netbook before you buy and replace it:1) Locate the gray part number label on bottom of machine.2) If there is a "D3" in the UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER of the label, then DDR3 memory is installed, upgrade using the following: "PA3856U-1M2G Toshiba DDR3-1066MHz, 2GB Memory" or compatible - NOT THIS ONE!3) All other units, assembled with DDR2 memory, upgrade using the following module: "PA3669U-1M2G, Toshiba DDR2-800MHz, 2GB memory Module" or compatible - LIKE THIS ONE!.Alternate Identification Method (Serial Number):1) PLL50U-01900C(5B294965K or greater, or a serial number starting with 6B ,7B , 8B) use DDR3 (NOT This one).2) PLL50U-01900C(5B294964K or less, or a serial number starting with 4B,3B , 2B ,1B, ZA, YA, or XA)- use DDR2 (This one)."
