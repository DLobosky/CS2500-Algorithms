I've been using Jason shampoos for years, mainly their Tea Tree Oil, which I use in combination with the Biotin shampoo, with great results. This formula is great for dry and also normal hair. I don't even need to use conditioner.It doesn't add weight to the hair at all or make it look greasy like other formulas do.Very nice product.NOTE: This shampoo has a strong scent, like all Jason Natural formulas. I don't mind it at all, but those who prefer unscented or lightly scented shampoos will probably find it objectionable.
