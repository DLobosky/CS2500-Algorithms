I read this book about a year ago. None of the stories are really memorable. There was time travel, demons, mysterious unexplained happenings - pretty much all the end-of-the-world scenarios. I skimmed it again a couple of weeks ago looking for a particular short story.  This really is a mediocre gathering. No reflection on Drake - he's one of my favorite authors, but he should not have branded this book with his name.
