The most glaring aspect of this fantasy world is the bramble. The bramble is a chocking plant that is taking over the world by covering it, and why it is happening is because magic causes it to grow. The citizens have fled cities to be consumed by the bramble, and in this story the city is Khaim, and is ruled by a Mayor and his magician. All magic is prohibited because it causes the bramble to advance, and as a result people are executed who use it.This story is about an alchemist named Jeoz who used to be very wealthy crafting copper urns and other items, but now he is driving himself into poverty trying to invent a way to destroy the bramble. This has become an obsession and his daughter hates him and he has lost all his servants except his assistant. But all looks good when Jeoz does come up with a solution and presents it to the mayor. But not everyone dislikes the bramble, and this becomes a tragic tale. This was simply told but flowed very well and was a nice story that had elements of an old fairy tale. This was a good little story that was a pleasure to read.
