Kriya Yoga refers to a specific meditation technique popularized in American by Paramahansa Yogananda in "Autbiography of A Yogi." Maddeningly, that book never reveals the technique, leaving the interested reader to send away to Yogananda's ashram for months of preliminary lessons before he is eligible for "initiation" into the core technique. I bought this book, "The Spiritual Science..." hoping the technique would be explained. It isn't. He explains pretty much everything else in Yoga, and does so quite well; the book is a good compendium of techniques. But the actual Kriya technique is only taught if you go visit his ashram in Chicago, according to a wispy-voiced woman I spoke to there. If you want to learn a straight version of the actual Kriya technique, buy The Sacred Science by Norman Paulsen. He's thrown in a lot of Christian theory and jargon, but the technique itself is what he learned from Yogananda, and he gives it to you in a clear and practical form. However, keep in mind that there is some controversy about whether the version of the Kriya technique that SRF teaches, as taught by Yogananda, was simplified for a western audience. Having learned another version of the technique from followers of Swami Hariharananda, and having read the SRF version, I can say only that the version I was taught seems more complete. The key difference being that, in the SRF version, in the core exercise the energy and breath are moved up and down the spine, as if the spine were a straw. In the version I learned, the breath is moved up the spine, around the top of the head where it passes through the crown chakra, and then down the front of the body, chakra by chakra, and up and around again and again, with other steps following the basic pranayama, and preceding it. Now, I cannot say whether one is more effective in inducing meditation, stilling the mind, raising the kundalini, fostering spiritual growth, and I suspect that it might be an individual thing. But the reader should understand that when one says "kriya yoga," the techniques differ considerably, with the guru who claims to be teaching Babaji's kriya yoga teaching still another variation that is quite dissimilar from what I have described. This of course leads to controversy: which is authentic? My advice: read as much as you can, then find a teacher with a solid lineage and learn that version of the technique first hand. While I have had an excellent experience with the Hariharananda group, I'm sure there are other teachers, including the SRF and those who studied there and started their own schools, as well as the author of this book. Meanwhile, practice what you read and see if it helps your meditation.
