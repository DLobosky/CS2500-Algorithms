After a rocky ending of Book Five, I was wondering were the magic was. This unpleasant rockyness is were DT6 takes off. It's at these point were I relize somethings not right. What happened to Eddie's smart-ass humor, what happened to the sense of forboding mystery, what happened to the story mostly revolving around Roland, YA KNOW THAT GUY FROM THE FIRST BOOK! The original romantic prose of the first few books is also rudley absent, and the ayes, yars and Commalas get old fast. I can appreciate King's merit in banging out the end of the tale fast, but maybe it should of stayed in the word processor a little longer.Stephen, I hope you ended the tale without forgetting the face of your' father.
