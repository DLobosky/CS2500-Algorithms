Extremely durable, functional and relatively inexpensive, I have had a G-shock since the early 1990s and have never looked back. Recently, Casio has elevated the watch to what I think may be among the "coolest tools" ever.  As rugged as always, but now with solar power (able to continue for almost 2 years even in total darkness) and the "Wave Ceptor" atomic clock synchronization, this dual display analog/digital watch represents the culmination of many years of striving for perfection.  I think that they have finally attained it.  There will continue to be more bells and whistles added to watches, but the GW1200A-1AV and it's siblings represent the pinnacle of watches: nearly invincible, totally accurate, and with an endless supply of energy.  What a wonderful machine!
