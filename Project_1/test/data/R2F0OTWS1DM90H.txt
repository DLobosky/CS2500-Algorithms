A button cell battery installs into one of the "eyecup" pieces; the on/off switch is conveniently located on the right top corner of the glasses in an easy to find / easy to use location. Pairing occurs automatically and the television recognizes when the glasses are on and synced. I have not had any problems with crosstalk or sync issues and, being Bluetooth and NOT relying on line of sight IR reception like last year's glasses, I have no problems when I look away from the screen.There are a couple of negatives. - These glasses are not rechargeable. I haven't run out a battery yet as I don't have enough 3D content to blow through, but I imagine I'll need to stock up on button cells to avoid inopportune interruptions. - These glasses sit a tiny bit high on my large nose. This forces me to slightly lower my head and look at the television dead-on, to avoid the resulting "uncovered area" between the bottom of the lenses and my cheeks. This isn't *necessarily* uncomfortable or unnatural, but it does force me into a more upright posture and doesn't facilitate viewing from a reclined position (eyes lowered). This is a common problem I have with sunglasses, too, and probably isn't an issue for those of you with more "normal" apportioned schnozzes. (I mounted my TV "mid height" on the wall -- not at "above the fireplace" height which might eliminate this problem, and not at "sits on a TV stand height" which might exacerbate the issue). - The wide lenses (my theory) result in reflection from any surface or object directly behind my seated position. I had a box stacked behind the couch with some lettering on it, and the lettering shows up in the periphery of my lens. Two solutions: dark back wall either with lighting or with paint, or longer eyecups /sideguards along the sides of the glasses (yeah, I'm talking about cardboard or construction paper!!) to eliminate the entrance of this light.Of my criticisms, #1 is solved by Samsung's rechargeable glasses, but #2 & #3 would appear to be common problems based on appearance.These, being the least expensive glasses of the Samsung lineup, are probably a good bet to have on hand in the event friends are coming over to watch a 3D movie, if you're so inclined.
