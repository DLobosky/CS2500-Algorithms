I was unable to get a consistent, satisfactory signal with this unit because of the antenna; the rest of the unit worked fine.I found that unless you had perfect exposure to the satellite that this antenna did not receive the signal very well. Also, the least movement of the connecting cord or if someone moved a blind/curtain, this would disturb the exact positioning required to make this antenna function properly.In the end I returned this unit and got an extra car antenna (the one with the strong magnet); this allowed me to put an extension cord under the window sill to the outside. From here, I was able to easily find a site for the magnetic antenna that resulted in excellent satellite reception (exact positioning is not nearly as important for the magnet antenna). Since then my home unit has worked perfectly.So...0 Stars for the headache in finding a secure, undisturbed spot for this unit. Makes you wonder if anyone at the company ever tried this unit before it went to market.Ray Nicholson
