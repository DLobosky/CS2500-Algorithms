'After Worlds collide' was the first Sci-Fi book I ever read. I had seen 'When Worlds collide' several times over the years.  Now here I was, on detention in the library, killing time. Then I see `After Worlds collide' on the shelf.  Gee, I didn't know there was a part 2 to the movie, I thought.  That's the day I became hooked on Sci-Fi.  23 years and 3000+ books later, I still am.  This is the movie that really started it all for me.The DVD is short on special features, but the transfer quality is great, and the sound in good. Sure it's dated.  Yea, the color is off. But it's still enjoyable.
