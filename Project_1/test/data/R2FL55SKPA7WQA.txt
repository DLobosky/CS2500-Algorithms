I chose the Sony for the sync feature and the consistency since I have a Sony 40" Bravia and Sony DVD. Setup was simple but programming did take a bit getting used to. Not horrible, but you have to get used to the menus, once you do, it is really pretty easy. I had read other reviews of how hard it was and that was overblown, if you are a bit tech savy, you can figure it out no problem. I wanted it to have 4 HDMI ports, but it only has 3 so I bought a very nice solution of a ViewHD 3 Port HDMI Switcher 3x1 Auto Switch 3-In 1-Out With 3FT Pigtail Cable and it works great. My spearkers are two Definantive 800's, a Definative 1000 center speaker and a Sony subwoofer, the sound is outstanding.  You can rename the ports to the menu on the unit can show what you want, for example instead of the default DMPORT, I renamed it I-Pad. The remote is very light weight and no light, that I don't like. There are also a ton of buttons that I don't knwo what they do, but for what I need, it seems to be simple enough to learn the 7-8 buttons I need to use all of the time. One feature I like is that I can turn off the unit and put still watch my Direct TV on the Sony Bravia 40" TV without the receiver being on, thus using only the TV volume, I found that by selecting a PASSTHROUGH feature in the menu. You can set the speaker distance, choose small or larger and select base and treble levels. There are also a variety of sound schemes, but I have picked one and stick with it for everthing from movies to music. I also bought the IPOD port and it works great and I can control the Ipod from the remote, however I cannot find how to see the onscreen IPOD display, not a big deal for me howerver since I just pick a playlist and go with it. The unit is smalller and lighter then most, that was important to me as well. Since my DVD and TV's are Sony, the remote works perfectly and I can contol them easily. For example, if I an watching Direct TV/SAT, I just push the remot to DVD and in 2 seconds my DVD is on screen and playing. One issue that I wish this had, was the abilty to listen to the IPOD throught the DMPORT and have the TV on at the same time, I can't find a way to do that. Sometimes I might want a football game on the TV with no sound for a party and the music playing as well, but I don't see a way to do that unfortunately. Overall for the money, this is excellent and don't worry about the reviews that say it is hard to set up, just be patient and read the manual, although the manual is not done as good as it could be.
