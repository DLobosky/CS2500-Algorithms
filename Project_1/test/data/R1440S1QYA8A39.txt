What's even better about it is that it's very laugh out loud funny.Some of the things I loved about Going Cowboy Crazy,1. It was easy to relate to the story and laugh along with the characters.2. The plot was very fast-paced. I read it in one sitting.3. The emotions of the characters were realistic. They didn't seem off in any way. I felt what the characters felt.4. The descriptions within the book was easy to picture. I wasn't left wondering. As I turned the pages, I felt like I was watching a movie. (Wish this was a movie)5. Again on the descriptions - when Katie, the author, described things it was done creatively and not in an `info dump'. There weren't several paragraphs describing the features of the characters or settings all at once and then the story moved on. She would put descriptive words here or there mingling them in with the rest of the plot.6. The secondary characters added to the story and helped create a memorable book.7. The actual plot was unique, refreshing, and easy to fall in love with. 8. The actual romance/heat was realistic and not rushed into. 9. Faith and Slate, main characters, were perfect for one another. I didn't stop and think to myself `This doesn't feel right. They should be with so and so.' 10. Last but not least was Katie Lane's writing style which was perfect in my opinion.
