Personally I think I've had "good luck" since I started wearing them about 6 months ago but I'd put as much veritable weight to that feature as I would coming from a baseball player saying he loves his lucky batting glove.The band itself for this particular bracelet is of good quality and good color. I've purchased a couple off of Amazon here, and also received an "official" one for free. I've only ever really examined my "official" one, not any others. All of the cheaper Amazon bracelets are slightly different. Whereas my original Power Balance bracelet bubbles out very slightly at the hologram, this one caves in ever so slightly. Does it make a difference? No; it's hard to notice unless the bracelet is removed and examined fairly closely.The other thing I'll say about these bands is that I get a lot of comments about them, both from strangers and my friends. Many ask if it "really works," to which I usually reply, "not really." But hey, being a conversation starter is a pretty good perk, especially with a cute girl at a bar (just saying).I've seen people saying this band breaks.  I haven't had any problem after about 10 days of wearing.  I wear it to sleep and in the shower.  I don't yank it off, I try to be pretty careful with it since it's Silicon after all. A little bit of attention and I don't think there's any issue with the band tearing easily.All in all, I like these bracelets, and the price on Amazon is great for them, especially when you can find a seller with Prime. If you like wearing stuff on your wrist, I'd recommend it.
