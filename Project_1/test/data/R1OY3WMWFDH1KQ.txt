Update: May 2012Six years later, and these towels are still in pretty good shape. Perhaps they'll hold up another six or so!Update: June 2010I bought these towels in February 2006 and almost returned them immediately. When I opened the cellophane package, the towels reeked of something that smelled like insecticide. I washed them all immediately, and after the bad smell was gone, I just loved how they felt. They reminded me of soft, fluffy, oversized hotel towels. In our household, we have used these towels almost daily, and they've received regular washing.In my original one-year review, I was disappointed that some of the towels were showing signs of inferiority: edges had frayed on some and on others, the soft nap seemed to have disappeared.But others pieces have remained in pretty good shape. So after over four years, I'm still getting good use from these, and except for my initial displeasure with the packaging noted above, I've been pretty satisfied.
