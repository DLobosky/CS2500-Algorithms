It does this with a well written little story and wonderful drawings. George and The Man (Dick Cheney) are up to their old tricks again, this time spying on people with the MSA (Monkey Spy Agency).The second book of the series, "Clueless George Is Watching YOU" is a humorous look at how the Bush administration's spying on individuals has mushroomed and how it was hidden from the public. The drawings are detailed and need to be viewed several times before their full impact will hit.This is the longest of the books. Although I think was great, don't read this if you are a Bush fan. If, however, you are a reasonable human with a funny bone, then these little books are a must. They are a little expensive for what you get, so I would recommend either getting it either used, from a library (as if that is likely) or by buying the three book set on sale here on Amazon.
