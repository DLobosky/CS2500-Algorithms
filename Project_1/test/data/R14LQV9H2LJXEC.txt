This has quickly become a family classic in our house, Particularly around Halloween. My 4 1/2, 8 1/2 and 10 years old girls love this one!The story stems around a shady real estate salesman(aren't they all) whom offers a can't refuse deal to a unsuspecting family from 'out of town'.   Unknown to the family, Dark Falls was the victim of some type of hazardous chemical spill a while back, causing the existing residents to become 'living dead'.  Unfortunately for these 'living dead' corpses, they are dependent on 'the living' for nourishment.Thus, they use this one piece of real estate property - AKA Dead House - as 'bait' to unsuspecting family's in order to feed. Without disclosing the whole storyline, I must say the thing with the dog at the end adds a nice touch. Well worth $10.  I've spent twice that continually renting it at the video store!
