I just wanted some speakers to give me decent sound when I listen to music and watch movies and my MacBook. I thoroughly enjoy the quality of the sound from these speakers for the price. I appreciate that volume, bass, and treble controls are right on one of the speakers, along with headphone jack and aux input jack. Most speakers in this price range have only a bass adjustment and not treble as well. The power switch is in a hard-to-reach spot on back of sub. I also do not like that none of the adjustment knobs are marked with a line to see how far they are turned up; you just have to gauge the level yourself.The right speaker has a wire that runs to the sub, a wire that runs to audio source, and a wire to the left speaker. All the wire connections are relatively short, as mentioned in other reviews. This isn't a problem for me I live in a dorm room and have all the pieces of the system close together on my desk with the sub on a shelf directly above. However, this could be annoying for someone who wants to spread out the equipment more.The speakers themselves are incredibly light, unfortunately so much that the thick wire to the sub was pulling on a speaker and keeping me from turning the speaker the way I wanted. However, they are a decent size and covered with a solid protective grill.Overall, any criticisms are minor. These have awesome sound from classical music to loud movie noises. Get these speakers if you're looking for a reasonably-priced 2.1 system.
