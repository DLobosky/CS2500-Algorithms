As reflected by author Arthur C. Clarke in the third of Clarke's Three Laws of Prediction, Eureka is a town of "magic" for the scientifically minded. With the same sociopathic aplomb of Harry Potter, it's a place where things and people explode - in fact, they're almost encouraged to. Characters frequently refer to the towns founding principle of "pushing the boundaries" of science, and the by product of collateral damage that results. This doesn't make the job of its new Sherriff, Jack Carter, any easier. Carter, one of the "normals" (with a normal IQ), finds the town's blas&eacute; reactions to the various explosions, disintegrations and mad-science downright unsettling.Don't look for real science here - it's all Buck Rogers and Star Trek variety. There's alot of talk about tachyons and theoretical equations, but it's all lighthearted so you don't need a PhD to appreciate.Ferguson, who plays Carter, is a long overlooked actor, and his goofy, uncomfortable demeanor fits well with the character of a "normal" sheriff out of his depth. Originally having low expectations of the series, I'm now a fan, due in no small part to Ferguson's awkward yet convincing characterization.In Season 2, the show finally latches onto plot cohesion, centered around a mysterious "artifact" that predates the existence of our universe. There's a nod to alchemy late in the series, (the magic that started science), as well as one to the dichotomy of the pursuit of all knowing science in contrast to a belief in the unknowable divinity. Unlike other shows, Eureka's season finale doesn't involve much of a cliffhanger - the issue presented is more or less resolved during the last two episodes of the series. Jo, (Carter's likeable, psychopathic deputy), develops a love life with a rogue PC hacker, Zoey (Carter's daughter) finds herself dating the ultimate nerd (and liking it), while the Machiavelli-with-a-heart-of-gold Nathan Stark resumes his on-again-off-again relationship with Ally, the latter having replaced Stark as head of GD. Beverly, the town's psychologist (who is also engaged in industrial espionage), get's some comeuppance in Guantanamo, then returns later to wreak some minor havoc in the last two episodes. While the storyline plays out in the series (with no cliffhanger ending), you're still left eager to see what comes in Season 3.
