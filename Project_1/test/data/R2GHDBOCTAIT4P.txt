Yates, a longtime investor in film and music properties and founder and president of Consolidated Film Industries, Republic was the result of a union of six smaller Poverty Row studios --- In its early years Republic was itself sometimes labeled a "poverty row" company as its primary product were B-Movies and Serials --- Republic, however, showed more interest in, and provided larger budgets to, these films than many of the larger studios were doing, and certainly more than other independents were able to --- The heart of the company was its B-westerns, and many western-film leads, among them Gene Autry, Rex Allen, Donald "Red" Barry, Johnny Mack Brown, Smiley Burnette, Rod Cameron, Sunset Carson, Ray "Crash" Corrigan, Yakima Canutt, Eddie Dean, Wild Bill Elliott, Monte Hale, Gabby Hayes, Jack Holt, Allan Rocky Lane, Bob Livingston, Kermit Maynard, Clayton Moore, Roy Rogers, David Sharpe, Bob Steele, Max Terhune, Tom Tyler and John Wayne, became recognizable stars at Republic."Republic's Wild & Woolly Western Heroes, Heroines, Heavies & Sidekicks"  (Title & Page Number)1.
