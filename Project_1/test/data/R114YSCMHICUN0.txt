I'd say it's some kind of thinner semi-shiny nylon which looks waterproof/resistant; almost seems similar to some of the nylon shells you see on ski-wear. However, I loaded it up with some heavy stuff and picked up the bag. It looked like it was holding the weight ok, but I didn't get that for-sure feeling that it would hold up well in the long run. Compared with when I saw the 24" Bucket Boss Big Daddy Extreme bag, that bag was built and stitched so well and so thick, I was sure it can hold a ton tools with no problem, but this bag seems questionable given the thinner looking nylon material.Measurements-wise, the one I got is around 24 inch width, 13 inch depth, and 13 inch height. These are measurements I took myself while I had the bag completely opened up and standing tall as it can. I saw some conflicting numbers on this bag depending on the hit I got, so I felt it was important to mention this.I also don't want to forget mentioning that the bottom has skids like some reviewers said. The product description calls them rails and that's probably the best way to describe it. There are two long tough plastic rails on the bottom just like you see on some soft luggage. Lastly, the bag comes with a shoulder strap, which I haven't tried yet.The outside pockets don't seem that useful because they do not protude out like other bags I've seen (such as the Bucket Boss I mentioned above). The few inside pockets are kind of loose with thin layer material so seems more built for holding larger dull items (not like screwdrivers or small things as much).If you can take a look at a Craftsman 18" or 20" bag (not their pro-grade bags, but just the cheaper versions that only cost around $20 bucks), it seems the material of the Dewalt is just about the same thickness, but they are different materials for sure. The Craftsman is not as shiny as the Dewalt.Overall, the only thing that impressed me about this bag is the size as it has pretty large dimensions compared with the other 24" tool bags I have been researching (the specs on Marshalltown's 24" NB203 comes pretty close, but unfortunately I don't have it front of me to measure). As for quality, I'd say it's so-so and it can PROBABLY do a decent job holding a bunch of big dull ended tools. If you have a lot of smaller sharper tools such as drill bits and such, I'm sure you will question if the bag is strong enough to resist punctures like I am questioning myself. If you want to hold something like a hydraulic floor jack (as I have seen in someone else's review for a large tool bag), I think the bag will easily handle that.
