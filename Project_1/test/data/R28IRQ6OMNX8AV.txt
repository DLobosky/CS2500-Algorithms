In The Clocks of Iraz, Mr. de Camp continues the saga of Jorian who has been called to Iraz by Karadur to repair the water clock.  As with The Goblin Tower: (#1) (Reluctant King, Vol. 1), nothing is as simple as it sounds.  Instead, Jorian deals with the political intrigue of Iraz and a country that's forced to go to war rather than rescue his love from Xylar. My Likes:My likes are as from The Goblin Tower; the characters, the weaving of the story, and the lay of the land; to put it simply it's the complete package.  While Mr. de Camp didn't do as much character development on Jorian or Karadur, secondary character descriptions are as strong as from The Goblin Tower.  Zerlik is such a fop but lovable with how he follows Jorian.  Similar efforts are provided for King Ishbahar, Colonel Chuivir, and the others.    Environment wise Mr. de Camp has added a new area for us, Iraz.  Iraz reminds me of descriptions of Byzantium.  While the culture is intelligent (they have an Academy of wizardry and learning) and cosmopolitan (as Byzantium was), there's a corrupt feeling to it as Byzantium had at the end (the Academy isn't as wise as it was and the political environment is total has).  This new environment makes for an interesting background for Jorian to save things.My Dislikes:This time Mr. de Camp jumped with things a little fast for me.  One chapter Jorian is in Novaria; two chapters later he's in Iraz; two chapters later he's repaired the clocks.  At this rate, how long before he's King of Iraz...  I believe Mr. de Camp could have improved the story by slowing it down a little and describing a few more things about the environment.The Rating:This is a solid 4 star book.  Mr. de Camp has built and excellent sequel to The Goblin Tower.  I would have considered rating it higher but Jorian's story is kind of left hanging at the end and I didn't feel that Mr. de Camp told us a complete story with this one.  No matter, if you started the series, read this one and enjoy what Mr. de Camp presents.
