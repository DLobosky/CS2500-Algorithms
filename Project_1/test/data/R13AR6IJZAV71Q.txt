The specifications of the DVD that are listed above state that the DVD is four hours.  If this is true, PBS is releasing the shortened (edited) version on the DVD.  PBS did this with the early Inspector Lewis DVDs (the Pilot and Series 1&2), and everyone complained.   It appears that PBS is doing this again.  After the complaints about (and lack of interest in) the early Inspector Lewis DVDs, I think that PBS relented and released the full videos with the Series 3 Inspector Lewis DVD.  If PBS is doing this again, it upsets me.  What PBS chooses to air is its business.  I don't have to watch it, and I don't have to support PBS.  I really resent it, however, when PBS prevents me from purchasing the complete program.  I wish that British producers would not grant PBS the right to issue the American DVDs, and grant that right to Acorn or Koch instead.I hope that I am wrong about this.  If I am, I am sorry for the misinformation.The following is from Wikipedia.  I mention it because it shows that if the public complains about the the time edits, PBS can be convinced to change its mind on this issue:"PBS owns the exclusive rights to both broadcast Lewis and to manufacture DVDs for North America. This is in contrast to Inspector Morse, which was commissioned by British company Carlton Television (originally Central Independent Television) and which included all original broadcast footage, even if that footage was edited on North American TV stations. PBS edits 10 minutes out of every Lewis episode so that it fits into the 90 minute Masterpiece Mystery time slot; this includes a preview of the episode's contents narrated by Alan Cumming before the episode and commercials for other PBS programs at the end of this slot. Even Barrington Pheloung's end credit music is abruptly cut for this purpose. For the Pilot, Inspector Lewis 1, and Inspector Lewis 2 DVD sets, PBS Home Video releases what was broadcast on-air in the US as opposed to the UK DVD content. However, for the new Inspector Lewis 3 DVD set, PBS Home Video has released the unedited UK version of the programs contained in the set."
