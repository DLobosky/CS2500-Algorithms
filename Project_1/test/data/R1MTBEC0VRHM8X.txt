I was so excited to get the first season of my all-time favourite show on DVD.  As always, I give top marks to the show, it's beautifully acted and filmed.  The only reason I didn't give the DVD 5 stars was because I was a bit disappointed with the bonus features, and I would have liked to have seen it digitally restored.  but in terms of the quality of the actual show, you can't get any better.enjoy!
