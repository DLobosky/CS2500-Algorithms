For less than a ten spot, you get six 15 gram boxes of quality incense, and all of these scents have something good to offer, though mileage will of course vary. Also worth noting: most of the vendors offering this 6 pack also offer the Super Saver Shipping on this item.Nag Champa: This the the classic blue box incense, and if you're shopping for incense you've no doubt heard of it, if not smelled it for yourself. You know what you're getting with this one.Patchouli Forest: This is NOT the patchouli from the drugstore deodorant aisle, the patchouli that made you feel that if you never smelled patchouli again it would be too soon. THIS is the patchouli you smelled that time in somebody's dorm room and asked what it was and was surprised by the answer you got. It is a rare patchouli, this, and well worth the price of all the rest of the incense in this pack. But wait! There's more.Midnight: This is a sandalwood and vanilla based incense that has a sweet, spicy something that has quickly made it my favorite incense for relaxing at bedtime. It's kind of mysterious, in a good way.Sandalwood: A very good sandalwood incense, not my personal favorite sandalwood but it does smell very nice.Sunrise: As I've taken to using the Midnight before bed, I've also been enjoying the Sunrise upon waking. There's a good dose of vanilla and something else that makes me think of baked goods for some reason. Kind of reminds me of allspice.Celestial: This is a subtle fragrance that I've found useful for balancing out strong, single-note fragrances like Satya Sai Baba's Jasmine Blossom. Burning the Celestial alongside of it gives it more depth. By itself, the Celestial reminds me of Frankincense and Myrrh, only lighter, with a wood base that might be sandalwood. It's a nice choice if you're kind of in the mood for some incense, but nothing that might be overpowering.On the whole, this 6 pack was worth every penny, and I've enjoyed each of the fragrances for different reasons.
