The King of Queens is still the one of the funniest shows on TV.  I loved watching the second season on DVD.  Kevin James and Leah Remini have great chemistry as a married couple, and Jerry Stiller is so funny as Arthur.   The story lines on the show are so funny and simple. My favorite episode is the one about how Doug and Carrie meet for the first time.      The episode where Doug tries so hard to rekindle the romance in his marriage by giving Carrie flowers is very funny too.    I also loved the episode where Doug takes Arthur to a baseball game after he accidently hurts his feelings.  Jerry Stiller is just  hillarious in the episode where Arthur gets a job managing a pretzel shop.   I also enjoyed the episode where Doug buys a RV trailer and argues with Carrie about where to go on vacation. Victor Williams, who plays Deacon Palmer on the show is Doug's best friend and a perfect supporting cast member.   One of the funniest episodes of season 2 is where Doug and Deacon go to Atlantic City to go gambling.  This DVD does not include interviews with the cast members like on the 1st season DVD,  but it does have a feature called A Day in the Life of Kevin James.  It shows Kevin James going on various talk shows like Conan and Regis and Kelly and having fun playing baseball.  This extra feature shows that Kevin James is such a nice person in real life.  This DVD is really fun to watch.  I can't wait until the 3rd season of the show is released on DVD.
