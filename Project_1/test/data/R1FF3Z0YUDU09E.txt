He never achieved, or aspired to, the notoriety of his friends Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz.  But in his last decade, he became something of a cult figure, his performances and recordings sought out by those curious about this last link to the Golden Age of Piano Playing, and those simply wondering whether someone so elderly could still move his fingers.  As record producer Max Wilcox wrote, "the fact that his body is old is beside the point."  Wilcox, who worked with Rubinstein, signed Horszowski to the Nonesuch label in the mid-1980s, and together they made four fine recordings.  This one, from 1988, is the second of those four.From the first bar of the two Mozart Sonatas, one's ears are caressed by the beauty and variety of Horszowski's tone.  It's not for nothing that he was a pupil of the great Leschetitzky, who worked ceaselessly on tonal production.  (We are fortunate that Horszowski lived long enough to pass this gift onto his pupils Murray Perahia and Radu Lupu.)  Horszowski neither confines the sonatas to a small scale, nor hammers compositional points home (ALA Glenn Gould), but simply plays the music in a sensible tempo, with discrete rubato and dazzlingly even passage work--which serve to remind one that Mozart was a virtuoso pianist as well as a composer.  Horszowski's Chopin is ravishing, as befits a fellow Pole--whose mother studied with Karl Mikuli, himself a pupil of Chopin.  Sometimes referred to as a Romantic pianist, Horszowski is Classically oriented in all respects save two: his way of phrasing a group of notes as a singer would, and his de-emphasis of the bar line.   His Mazurkas have an irresistible rhythmic lilt, and I've never heard the C major Mazurka played better.Horszowski brings tender longing to Schumann's Arabeske, with a beautiful legato touch.  He gives the Kinderszenen as if experienced in childhood, rather than as an adult's reminiscence.  I don't agree with this approach.  What is the disillusionment of the last piece "the Poet Speaks" if not the work of an adult composer?  But, within his conception, Horszowski's performance, innocent and with flashes of humor, works on it own terms.  Recorded at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, where Horszowski taught for fifty years, the sound is clear,spacious, and natural.
