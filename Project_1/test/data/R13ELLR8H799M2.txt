Not to mention the character of Maria is a totally different person with long-hair...nice change! It is also fun that they make note of the difference in one of the episodes...I love that kind of humor.2) If you like Smallville you'll probably like this show3) Some great dialoge and writing, especially the comic relief we have in the characters of Maria and Kyle4) You care about each character and each is interesting in their own way5) This is a sci-fi TV show...so you must suspend belief at times, which we are able to forgive because the soap opera of the characters lives is actually engaging6) Special effects are ok, not superb but adequateOverall, we really like this show and as we are currently mid-way through watching the 2nd season it has only gotten better. I hear the third and final season gets really crazy (wierd in a bad way) but I'll have to see for myself when it is released on DVD in October.
