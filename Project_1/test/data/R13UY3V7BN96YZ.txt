This book is NOT the book you are looking for. Find the American Girl book on this subject and you will be so impressed and pleased with the beautiful way it handles this subject. Your little girls will become so confident and feel secure about the changes, rather than worried and confused by the inappropriate material that is in this book. BTW, my daughter has been raised on a ranch and probably knows more about reproduction and sex than all the four and five star givers on here that think I'm being naive or "prudish" about this topic.  The title of this book, "The Period Book", is SO misleading, and would cause many to believe it is a book for young girls learning about the changes coming to their bodies and why they happen.  It is not, and the material in this book would be more  for older girls or young women who have made the choice to become sexually active(and have started and learned about "periods", etc. so why this title?).Read it, word for word before handing it to your young daughters!BE VERY WARY AND SUSPICIOUS OF THE ONES ON HERE HYPING THIS BOOK AND GIVING GOOD REVIEWS!! THEY HAVE NO OTHER REVIEWS ON ANY OTHER PRODUCT FROM AMAZON!  THEY ARE HERE TO HYPE AND SELL THIS BOOK!For instance, this book tells you that you can get pregnant if sperm is on a finger and it is put "inside of you". This is absolutely ridiculous in a book they are recommending to nine year olds to learn about growing up, emotions, body changes and starting menstruation! (As if getting pregnant is the only troublesome aspect if someone is "placing a finger with sperm" in them at their ages?)ThIS author has written supernatural and horoscope books before, and other odd titles and how does that even qualify her to write about such a topic regarding OUR kids and a company like Amazon to even carry it? Simply she is qualified because she has a 14 year old neice?! Give me a break! This book also goes on into how to position legs and behave for an OBGyn, birth control pills, etc. If you want a book that will make your daughter feel beautiful, confident, in control of her body and what happens to it, and proud to be growing up, look at the American Girl book here on Amazon. I literally threw this "period" book in the trash.  You will too.To the author of this book:SHAME ON YOU for using clever illustrations, a misleading title, and presentation on such a poorly written, completely off the mark book for young girls. You are taking financial advantage of moms looking for that special book about growing up for sharing with their young daughters.
