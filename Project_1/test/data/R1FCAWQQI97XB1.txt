I came to Amazon looking for African coffee when Green Mountain raised their shipping rates to $30 for 1-2 lbs to Hawaii, making it just too expensive to maintain.  It is practically impossible to find African coffee here, which is why I had been getting it by mail to begin with, and my early experiments were not very satisfying.  I bought Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag and found it to be burned, bitter.  At the time I thought it was better than none at all, and so tried their Kenya AA (actually, it was Kenya AB, which I had never seen offered before) at which point I figured they were just buying lesser beans, and so the search continued.  I tried a sampler from Coffee masters Coffee Masters Around The World In Twelve Coffees Variety Pack, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12) and was overall pretty impressed, so I subscribed to several of their single origin roasts.  The yirgacheffe is very nice, not the very best I have ever had, but way way better than what I got from coffee bean direct.  Recently I received a notice of a price increase prior to my subscription shipment, and so decided to try Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3).  That was nice coffee, mild and smooth, but did not have the distinctive taste of Ethiopian coffee, and so I am back :)The Coffee Masters roast is just about right for the coffee, a medium roast which brings out the chocolately undertones (which I missed with the Equal Exchange roast).  I have received several shipments, all were fresh, roasted right: no complaints whatsoever (but for the price increase ;)  This is the best African coffee I have found on Amazon thus far, and I have tried at least half a dozen.  That is not to say there may not be a better one lurking which I have not tried, but I am more than satisfied with this and so just reupped my subscription.I you do not typically order single origin coffee, or are not looking for a certain distinctive taste you would probably like the equal exchange more than I did.  It is a nice cup of coffee, but in my opinion, this one is better.  This is a nice coffee' mild, smooth and non-acidic, what's more, it tastes like single origin Yirgacheffe complete with the floral nose and chocolate finish.  I am looking forward to starting my day right again!
