No Country for Old Men is one of those movies you just can't wait to see if it lives up to all the hype.  Well, the first half of the film had me glued to the screen.  I only wish the second half could have been anything close.C'mon folks, the movie had intrigue, really cool characters, interesting dialogue...everything going for it.  And then poof, it's all gone.  What happened?  Why would any writer or director let this happen?Watch the first half of this movie, stop the DVD, and then make-up your own ending.My three stars is only for the first half.  The second half gets a -3 stars.See ya next review.
