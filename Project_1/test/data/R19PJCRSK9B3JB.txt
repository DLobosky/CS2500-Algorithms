But first...let me give folks who haven't picked it up a few warnings:1) this is more in the vein of a Harry Potter book than it is a typical YA fantasy/romance. yes, it does have romance/fantasy galore. and teens. but the love scenes are slow to build and rather tame for a YA book...and the world-building is quite lovely and rather complex whereas I find so many YA books today gloss over that aspect to focus on the lead character relationship. 2) the story takes a while to get going. and it felt awkward at the start...likely due to the gear shifting I had to perform to get into the groove of a non-American teen. Gwyneth comes across as younger than her age, likely due to all of the above. This isn't a turn off for me (but I'm a grown woman) however it could be kind of annoying for older teen readers who prefer things a bit more hip and less gawky.Those two items aside...which, as far as I'm concerned, don't make the book any less awesome than it is....this was a fun and entertaining read. I literally could not put it down and ended up staying awake FAR too late last night, resulting in a reader hangover of the worst sort this morning. Not great when you have two young kids to feed and hustle off to school.This book has it all....fantastically complex characters and a twisted plot that promises fun and danger/darkness in spades, a (so far) light romance (or two) to keep me happy, a likeable heroine who one can't help but root for as she bumbles along when her "gift" reveals itself in the most inconvenient way. The writing is crisp and clean with lots of humor and some pathos thrown in for good measure. I sense a lot of hidden mysteries waiting to pop to the surface. Some folks said the plot is predictable...aside from the expected romance, I didn't find this in the least. There were a lot of surprises here and I cannot wait for the story to continue in the next book.I'm not going to go into the details of the story...you can find that on the book description or read the other reviews. But I will say if you enjoy books that aren't afraid to delay gratification for a lot of detailed world building and in-depth characterization...and you like YA fantasy, romance, and time travel...please give this a try. I think you may enjoy yourself. Also, this book is perfect for tweens and teens given the lighter romance content.BTW, what a gorgeous cover!!!
