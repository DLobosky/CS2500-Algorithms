The price of these pajamas is the best I could find on the internet and the quality is great! I got him the dark green ones and some light blue ones. The weight of the nylon is just right. My hubby is VERY happy with this purchase!! The service from this seller was fantastic. Shipping was quick. Would purchase again!
