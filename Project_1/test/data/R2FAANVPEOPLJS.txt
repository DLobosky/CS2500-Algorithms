I love this stuff and use it daily. The smell is subtle vanilla and smells very nice. It covers and spreads on the body easily with no greasy residue. One application lasts me all day in the summer sun. I came back to Amazon to buy more as I cannot find it in local stores. I highly recommend this product.
