Ubersoldier 2 plays very nicely on my 6-year old Pentium XP computer with all settings maxed out.  Very smooth gameplay, great graphics and physics, missions so far are balanced and challenging, and you can save game whenever you wish.I purchased this game from an Amazon Marketplace seller (BT Enterprises Inc. - these guys are great!) and it cost less than three dollars plus shipping.  For a bargain priced game, you can't go too wrong with Ubersoldier 2 or even the first Ubersoldier ... Highly recommended.
