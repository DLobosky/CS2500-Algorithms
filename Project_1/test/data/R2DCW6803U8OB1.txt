Kugelmann was apparently a student of Paul Hofhaimer, and later concertmaster for the Duke of Prussia in Brandenburg.  This collection is one of the earliest Protestant sound music publications appearing in Augsburg in 1540. The songs in 'Concentus Novi', set for three high voices, are intended for use in the church and in the schools. This collection includes religious hymns in both the German and Latin tongues, the latter encompassing three complete Masses, this recording having one of them. The German works are based on a lied-like folk melody, which usually occurs in the middle of the three parts.  Following contemporary usage the three parts could be performed by singers and/or instrumentalists.  On this disc we have three recorders of varying size and the countertenor voice.  The choice of three recorders with voice is perhaps unusual for sacred music of  the period, but works fairly well, and there is no doubt about the relative quality of this collection, previously obsecure.  In fact, to my mind, the use of the countertenor sound with the recorders is a 'stroke of genius' on the part of Dr. Rene Clemencic, director and performer.  Bernard Landauer's vibrant bright sound endowed this lovely ancient music with an ethereal and mysterious quality that seemed to fit perfectly with Kugelmann's compositions. So much so that I became somewhat mesmerized at times, not only by the voice, itself, but by the interplay between the various sonorites involved.  This almost hypnotic feeling was most evident to me in the Mass.The Clemencic Consort is an ensemble of international artists that performs in variable combinations of instrumental forces depending on the respective program, and is directed by its founder Rene Clemencic.  These singers and instrumentalists devote themselves to the interpretations of early music from the Middle Ages to the Baroque, playing on historical instruments and thereby aiming for a lively authenticity.There are sixteen songs in all, five of which are only for the recorders, the remaining eleven featuring the voice with one or more recorders.  The accompanying information is sparse, but pertinent; the German and Latin text is included, but not translated into English.  I found this recording to be refreshingly interesting and also entertaining!
