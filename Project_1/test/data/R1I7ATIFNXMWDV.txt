Reading this book provides a fairly compact history of Cisco Systems ascent from a start-up to the world's most valuable corporation in less than 20 years.  As best I can tell from comparing the book to interviews  with Cisco executives and news reports, the data included are pretty  accurate.The only significant thing missing from this book is enough  context on why Cisco has been more successful than other companies.  The  details are there, but the highlighting of what is significant is too  light.  The essential point is that a company needs a vision, strategy,  values, culture, management style, and business processes that permit it to  prosper from irresistible forces and trends, regardless of how these turn  out.  Cisco has adhered to this perspective more than almost any other  company.The aspects of what Cisco does differently come primarily in  using acquisitions to add talent and provide flexibility responses to  unclear, emerging technology trends.  The accomplishment here is that the  talented people stay, are more productive than ever before, and fit  comfortably into the Cisco culture.  Hardly anyone ever does these things  well.The authors also understate the significance of how Cisco has  multiplied irresistible forces.  The focus on the Internet allows the  company to benefit from both Moore's and Metcalfe's Laws.  Because of that,  Cisco has a very high stock price.  That makes for low costs in acquiring  and keeping top people, through the use of stock-based acquisitions and  stock options.  Converging technologies mean that the Internet basis allows  the company to impinge on other forms of communications as the convergence  occurs.  All this means that Cisco has the potential to be 10 times the  size of Microsoft.  The key difference:  Cisco is much more adept at  irresistible force management.People who want to understand more about  high tech competition, how to create a successful company, and find good  investments will all find this book to be valuable.  I especially recommend  this book to people who are about to start up a new business.  Do take  the material with a little grain of salt though.  As good as Cisco Systems  is, they're not quite as good as this book suggests.
