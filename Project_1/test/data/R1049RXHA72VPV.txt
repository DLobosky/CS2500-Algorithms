This book combines a large amount of text with occasional crafts, most of which are either too difficult or uninteresting to the elementary students this was written for. The print font is large, as would be used in a 3rd grade book, but the vocabulary is written for a much older student. Be sure to review before using with your class.  From the elementary teacher's point of view, this won't work.
