You can get it cheaper by buying the '04 SE box set rather than these separately.  But wait, as a bonus you get the unaltered original Star Wars.  Well true but you are getting it with inferior quality as they are not anamorphic releases.  STAY AWAY AT ALL COST FROM THIS RELEASE!!!!  Do not spend your hard earned money on inferior quality and if you prefer the SE, get the box set instead.
