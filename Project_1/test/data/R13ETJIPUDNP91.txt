We get more inside look into this post apocalyptic world.  The groups of people that make up this series feels like old friends to me when I read it. The emotions are very strong in this book, both good and bad, but well balanced. I found this relationship better, more realistic. I could relate to both characters in some ways. The character development is this book is evident. The plots are weaved together well, enjoyed the story lines. The pace is fast, I couldn't put it down. This is a unique series in a paranormal world full of vamps, shifters, witches and demons. I can't wait for the next coming in January - theo's book. He was shot in the end of this book, so I can't wait to see how that plays out.
