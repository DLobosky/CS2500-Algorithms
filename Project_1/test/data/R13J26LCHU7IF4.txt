My son is a strong reader, and has thrived on the easy format and moved at his own pace to complete each book in the series.  First of all, Spelling Workout Level G is not simply a spelling program, but focuses largely on vocabulary development.  Each of 36 chapters consists of a vocabulary development exercise using the 20 list words, a dictionary skills exercise, the spelling or vocabulary rule theme of the chapter, three exercises (one more straightforward, the other two usually puzzles or word games), a proofreading exercise, a short writing prompt, and a list of bonus words with an exercise.  Every fifth chapter is straight review.Any parent or teacher should place thier child appropriately in the series, so for your information some of the words from each list in Level G include:Chapter 1 (vowel a):  abdomen, bachelor, transparency, advancement, manuscript, adhesiveChapter 15 (latin roots miss, anim, flu and man): animosity, inamimate, commission, influenza, unanimous, emancipate, fluentChapter 25 (ie vs. ei): heirloom, beige, efficient, hygiene, caffeine, grieve, surveillanceChapter 35 (exceptions to spelling rules): beneficial, hypocrite, tremendous, yacht, martyr, susceptibleMy son enjoys the puzzle exercises, and I appreciate the dictionary work as well as very useful proofreading exercises.  Our approach is simple. I begin with a spelling pre-test. My son does the vocabulary and dictionary work, and follows with a number of spelling exercises based on the number of words he spelled incorrectly.  We follow up with a post-test if needed, and move on to the next chapter.  I don't think Spelling Workout would be the best selection for a struggling or poor speller, as review is somewhat limited, but for an average to accelerated child it is an excellent, easy to use resource that at Level G goes far beyond simple spelling.
