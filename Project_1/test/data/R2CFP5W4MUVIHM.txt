I just returned from the Premiere and I can't wait to go back to the theater tomorrow to experience the magic again. As this movie is from the footage of rehearsals for his 50 concert performances in London, Michael Jackson was extraordinarily "hands on" regarding every facet of the concert "experience" he was creating. What I paid special attention to was Michael's appearance as far as health is concerned. I can ASSURE you this Gift to Humanity named Michael Jackson was at PEAK performance. He looked radiant, happy, he had a huge amount of energy, he was clearly in love with the process of creating something to make this world a better place - and he said so during rehearsals. With such super high energy that went into the rehearsals, I think just about anyone would have difficulty winding down to go to sleep. It is my pure opinion that Michael accidentally too more medicine to help him sleep, without realizing it was too much.  The energy Michael and ALL who were involved in these rehearsals exuded that "It" quality - the kind that is almost indefinable in words - that transports you with awe INTO the experience.   The movie Director, producers, special effects, make-up, costume, musicians, the dancers who performed with Michael during these final rehearsals before his passing are all PHENOMENAL. I feel we owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the special souls who actually took the footage during the rehearsals. What a GIFT you have given humanity. THIS IS IT is an extraordinary legacy that will remain with me forever, and I believe it will with you as well!10 Billion Stars!
