I have used this sunscreen all spring and summer, and love it. It smells so good, with a subtle vanilla fragrance, and applies easily with no greasy residue. I am very fair and burn easily, but this sunscreen lasts all day and I have not burned at all. In fact, it allows me to get a slight tan which is nice. I would highly recommend this hard to find product. I came back to Amazon to buy more!
