Twentieth century authors like Kafka, Joyce, Eliot, etc. were taught so as to challenge the complacent minds of middle-class students (p. 60).  However, being taught in college conferred on these works a status that made them guides for behavior rather than stimulation for discussion.  Students unquestioningly accepted the negative attitudes in these authors (p. 61) and the dark view of life they offered.  When the view became even darker and completely irrational and self-destructive in the late twentieth century, the authority conferred by their being taught in college still swayed the students.  What to do about all this is something that eludes Kernan.  He needs information which he, as a retired English professor from Princeton, does not have.  He continues the traditional antipathy to all other fields, particularly the physical and social sciences.  For instance, Kernan equates the relativity of Relativity Theory with the relativity of cultural anthropology (p. 80-81), even citing "uncertainty and probability" as marks of this relativity!  One consequence of this is Kernan's grouping reader-response theories among the bad guys.  "Reader-response or reception aesthetics drain the autonomous work of art of its meaning by relocating the meaning-making power to the eyes of the beholders." (p. 76)  This statement presupposes that a work can have no meaning unless it has the same meaning for every reader, certainly a debatable, not to say dubious point.  So, his book continues to the end as a kind of lament.  He has no solutions to offer.  And indeed, turning back the clock to the mindless Traditionalism of the past is no more a solution than continuing the mindless iconoclasm and interest-group politicking of the present.  For a book that is able to deal with these problems (because the author is not a traditionalist and has a knowledge of other fields), see A Book Worth Reading.  Still, Kernan scores some points against the iconoclasts which could occasion useful debate, but it is unlikely that they will ever read his book.
