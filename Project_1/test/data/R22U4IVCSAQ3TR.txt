The handset that comes with the base station has provision for using a headset with a 2.5mm plug and it comes with a belt clip. Easy to attach the handset to my belt and carry on a phone conversation while walking about and have both hands free. Every cordless phone I have bought since they first became available has had provision for a headset, and most have come with a belt clip, so I was quite surprised to get these Vtech phones and not find neither one was provided.The individual units have a speaker phone and no way to use a headset (wired or Bluetooth) and no way to attach a belt clip. The only way I can walk around and have both hands free is if I tape the handset to the side of my face with some duct tape. I have yet to find a speaker phone that makes it easy for the person at the other end of the line to understand what I am saying. I find the same thing to be the case when the person at the other end of the line is using a speakerphone and I need to understand what they are saying word by word. The speakerphone works on our Prius with its Bluetooth connection to a cell phone, but only for the driver who is sitting right in front of it. My wife likes to walk around the house talking to friends while she is doing minor chores or while cooking and a speaker phone on a handset is worthless for this type of situation as well. Speakerphones are also half duplex meaning only one person can talk at a time. It you don't mind using it like a CB mic then it works OK so long as you are sitting nearby or talk extra loud. But it is a matter of personal choice, but personally I would like to have the choice and be able to use a headset and use a belt clip and so I returned these phones and bought some from Uniden instead. The Uniden 2-line base station and all the Uniden handsets have both speaker phones and jacks for a headset and they all include belt clips and they cost less than the Vtech.[[ASIN:B002RL8IFY Uniden DECT 6.0 Two-Line Cordless Phone with Digital Answering System and Caller ID (DECT4096 ) (Black)]]Uniden 2-line Handset and Charger for DECT4000 Series
