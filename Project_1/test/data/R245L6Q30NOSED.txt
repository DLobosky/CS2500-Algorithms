She's NOT an Opera singer...she is an entertainer who uses Opera as one of her vehicles. Big Difference. Of course she's GORGEOUS; that's a self-evident truth. But, the girl can sing, too...This is a fantastic presentation of a concert Katherine did in her native Wales back in 2006. The home folks loved it, and her. That kind of chemistry makes for a great show. The bit with the camera was fun (she photographed the audience), and the sing-along on "God Save the Queen" and the Welsh National Anthem was a fine touch. Katherine even did well with the "Carmen" numbers (loved the dress), though I maintain that the full role is WAY beyond her league. Blonde Carmen? Well, Jeritza was a blonde Tosca...If you watch this expecting Elina Garanca, forget it. They're not the same. But, if you want a superbly produced video of a beautiful girl, backed by a fine orchestra, making just the right use of the instrument God gave her, you will love it. Enjoy!!
