This is the type of bland book that was written for a high school library, with all the interesting parts marginalized or omitted.  What every American needs to know is covered by Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong.This book is a bunch of definitions of common words covered in high school history courses, and that's about it.  Not a good resource for a writer, and I wouldn't recommend it for learning American History or culture.  Here are some examples of defined concepts:  Cupid (p33), creation science (p89), Woody Allen (p159), Korean War (p223), civil service (p303), Yankee (p344), Vancouver (p389), mutual insurance company (p448), epidemic (p536).I could see maybe giving this to a curious twelve year old, but not too sure it would help anyone who already has a High School diploma.
