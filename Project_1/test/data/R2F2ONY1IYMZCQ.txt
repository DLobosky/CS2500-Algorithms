Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a brilliant super hero movie. Sam Raimi has written a stupendous script and picked the right actors to be in it. Tobey Maguire is brilliant in the role of Spider-man and Defoe is sublime in the role of the Goblin. Kirsten Dunst is so cute and adorable and the perfect love interest for spider-man. The special effects are well made and I must say that I was very surprised by the overall quality of the movie. Great music, well written dialog and action scenes that were action packed and not overly violent. I highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars. I can not wait to watch part 2.
