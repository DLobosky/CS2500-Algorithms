I was rather startled when the first one wrapped up so soon.The first story is rather clever in premise and reminded me very much of Christopher Moore's A Dirty Job: A Novel But as good as this could have been, it came up short.  I didn't read the second story as I generally don't enjoy short stories.  And it looked like a short story...
