After seeing the movie & reading several reviews, it is obvious that the problems that resulted in the Civil War have not been resolved, & need to be addressed. I thought the movie was an excellent attempt to historical accuracy, while still making a small profit for the investors, on a limited budget. Massive sets would have been costly & would not have added that much to the movie. First time I have heard of 'extras' being 5000 volunteers & unpaid. Heresy in Hollywood. Although wordy, much of the dialog was gleaned from the letters written & saved from the time, & people did & do speak as they write. But by being less bloody & gory, its makes the film viewable by the very young, who truly need to be the ones to learn he 'lessons' of the civil war. The remaining problems still need to be resolved, & we must learn to forgive both the North & South for the transgressions of the other, & move on as a stronger, more powerful nation, respecting the views of each. This movie is certainly worth seeing, & investing in a copy for ones own home library, along with Gods & Generals, The Last Full Measure & the PBS series "The Civil War", recognizing that we can only gather as much information as possible, & each one make our own decisions.
