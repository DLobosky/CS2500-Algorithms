Though Tina is still my favorite character in the series because she is just so, for lack of a better word, Tina! What I liked: I liked learning more about Betsy's role as queen and how she tries to incorporate all her responsibilities with her life.  It really makes her more human in a lot of ways.Complaints: This book was not as good as the first 2.  I really didn't like the whole section after she read the Book of the Dead. The book got back to being good after a few chapters but it just distracted from the book for me.Audible Review:  I listened to this on audio book and the narrator was fantastic.  She nailed Betsy and Tina to a tee. I can't wait to listen to the rest of them :)Why it got a 3: This book was still a fun, light read that I would recommend to anyone who has read the first few in the series.Who I would recommend it to:  PNR readers that like a fun, light read that makes you giggle outloud!Author Website: [...]
