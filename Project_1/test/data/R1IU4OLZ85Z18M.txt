Eigene Wege is M&uuml;nchener Freiheit's fifteenth full-length album and was released in 2009.  M&uuml;nchener Freiheit is one of my favorite groups, and Eigene Wege does not disappoint.  Altogether, there are 13 tracks.  The album's songwriting is solid, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is pleasant.  Also, this album marks the first time that Aron Strobel (guitar/background vocals) handles lead vocals with the title track.  Stefan Zauner sings nicely and smoothly on the rest of the tunes.  "Ein Augenblick In Rot," "Helden," and "Nur Noch Du Und Ich" are my favorite compositions--all of these cuts provide infectious, lavish harmony vocals.  The disc is just over 48 minutes.  As for the CD booklet, it includes the lyrics to the songs and a color photo of the band.  M&uuml;nchener Freiheit creates well-crafted pop music with engaging, remarkable harmony vocals, and Eigene Wege is no exception to the rule.  Also, this band benefits me since I am a student of the German language; the vocals are sung clearly.  Eigene Wege is a recommendable piece of work.
