Susskind (1913-80) was born in Prague, the son of a music critic and piano teacher, he was conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra from 1968-75. He made this wonderful recording during that period as well as one of my favorite recordings of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra that, to my knowledge, has never been produced on CD. He made recordings for other labels with other orchestras including this one of Prokofiev's Chout suite Prokofiev: Chout (The Buffoon) that was recently reintroduced by the new U.K.-situated Everest records.Neither Walter Susskind nor the St. Louis Symphony were ever very big names in classical music, in part because neither made a slew of recordings. The St. Louis band, under Susskind, had a wonderful sound -- bold brass, plummy woodwinds and strings with a golden sheen. You hear all these elements in this retelling of Ma Vlast, the unprecedented set of six related tone poems written at various times by Smetana that became the standard for Czech national music in the 19th cenutry.Susskind's interpretation combines lovely playing with power, sympathy and understanding of the six tone poems, all built around Czech legends. The first four are marvelously performed by the St. Louis Symphony. While Tabor doesn't take wing as it does under Kubelik's baton with Chicago Symphony Smetana: M&aacute; Vlast, condcutor and orchestra more than compensate with beautiful bird calls and wondrous horn playing in the opening moments of Blanik that follows. Susskind's performance in Ma Vlast is relaxed and musical, not the fire and brimstone of Kubelik's powerhouse but coarse-sounding Chiacgo job and closer to the style of Zdenek Macal and the Milwaukee Symphony whose fabulous reading of Ma Vlast has been hailed by both American and European publications Bedrich Smetana: Ma Vlast (My Country).Susskind's recording had several previous lives on CD. There was an indivial CD on Vox from 1984 (VU 9007) and the recording later was combined with Susskind and St. Louis's less successful rendition of Holst's The Planets which Amazon buyers can still find Holst: The Planets/Smetana: Ma Vlast. When I owned the old CD of this (Vox 9007) I wasn't very thrilled with the sound. The orchestra played well and it was captured by the technicians OK but it seemed flat, almost one-dimensional. That's not the case anymore; here, Susskind and his orchestra are brought back to life as if they are giving this concert in your living room. The quadrophonic sound is accurate to its time and the sound itself is truthful if a tad bottom heavy, emphasizing the lower frequencies and timpani. It is a four-speaker recording, not 5.1.I have not seen this recording reviewed in any critical guide, so its profile is low. That's no reason to not consider it if you are in the market for a super audio recording of this music. The price is high, I agree, but not bad if you check the competition for Ma Vlast. Only Colin Davis's version Smetana: M&aacute; vlast [Hybrid SACD] comes in at the same price while Kenichirou Kobayashi's Japanese version will set you back almsot $70 Smetana: Ma Vlast [Hybrid SACD] [Japan]. And one of the best features is Richard Freed's fabulous notes from the early CD issue remain intact, all 8 pages of them in English, as well as a bio on the conductor. There's also some chatter about Ultradisk's recording technique and product. They all come in a hard plastic case, not one of those cheapies that will break easily.While Walter Susskind may not be Rafael Kubelik, he surely isn't Colin Davis, either. If you're in the mood and of a mind to spend a twenty on this music, you could do a lot worse than here.
