This video was fantastic. It is for us oldies that loved him from the start but also for the next generation that is coming up. Most of his work, movies, he wasn't proud of, but this is one that he can be very happy about. It showed him, with his friends, and I use that term lightly since most people, betrayed him, used him, promoted him, but you could see he loved them and still does I am sure. THis shows the vital part of him that lived in these songs he sang. I know to every woman there is a Elvis that is hers, that sings to her, only her, he made us feel that way. It showed a time in his life, when he was in the best physical form, even tho all this performing would take it toil on him in a few short years, in this he was the best, it showed how he new music and did things to songs his way, and made them so much better. This was great, and that is all I know to say except it was AWESOME!! it is truly a video that if you do not own, so you can watch it over, and show it to our children and grandkids, to show where it all started, and the man they always heard about, Elvis Presley.
