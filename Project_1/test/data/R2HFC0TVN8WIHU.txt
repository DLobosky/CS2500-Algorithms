Being a huge fan of the revolutionary era, I love this movie (and not for its historical (in)accuracies).  Had to upgrade to Blu Ray of course, but was unimpressed.  Its mildly better than the SD version, so I'd recommend buying only if you can get a good deal or if you don't already own the SD version.
