It is absolutely amazing to think that "The Terminator" was made on a shoestring budget of "only" $6 million, where the filmmakers were literally sleeping on couches and living off of coupons from McDonald's to making the transition to "Terminator 2 - Judgment Day!  Taking that into consideration and then looking at the over $150 million dollar budget for T2, which was the first of its kind, one can only sit back in awe at the silver screen masterpiece that was created by that budget.  With "The Terminator" being James Cameron's first feature film and the film that went far beyond "Conan the Barbarian" in launching Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the demand for this sequel was constant and finally overwhelming, leading them to begin it's filming in 1990.  The final outcome of that filming and budget being one of the highest grossing films to ever have been made, to date of which, the film has earned nearly a billion dollars, which is simply astonishing!From a personal standpoint, when this film made it to the silver screen, I believe I went and saw it at least two times and I even read the book that was released concurrently with the film.  The VHS tape release of it was rather worn out as well due to this being such a compelling and captivating story!The premise:Enhancing upon the basic story and theme of the first film which was the first of many paradox's within this plot, director James Cameron brings us forward approximately ten years.  We're brought to the Terminator's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) introduction as he does essentially the same thing he did in the first film, seek clothing and weaponry.  From the very beginning of this film you see that it still has the same dark undertones of humanities future struggle against the machines but at the same time its going to have a different style as there is some humorous scenes right up front.From there we're taken to the T-1000's (Robert Patrick) introduction in the film.  At this point in time, the viewer who hasn't seen this masterpiece before doesn't quite know which of the Terminators is going to be the bad guy.  From there we're taken to the introductions of John Connor, played rather well by Edward Furlong and then his mother Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton reprising her role from the first film.It doesn't take one long to figure out that this is a big film and that the action is going to blow you away whether you're seeing it for the first time or the tenth time.  Few films of this genre even come close to comparing to the scale and scope that is T2 Judgment Day!  Everything about this film from the script to the actors and their acting to the makeup and the soundtrack all screams box office smash hit!As you can surmise, I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the genre and fans of superb scriptwriting played out to perfection on the silver screen.  {ssintrepid}T2 Judgment Day Ultimate Edition Special FeaturesDocumentaries:- "The Making of T2" Featurette- "T2:  More Than Meets the Eye" Featurette- "The Making of T2: 3-D" Breaking the Screen Barrier"Special Features:- Supplemental Materials - Several features which cover every aspect of the film.- Cast and Crew Information- Trailers and Teasers- Entire Screenplay- Over 700 StoryboardsDVD-ROM:- An excellent DVD-ROM feature that allows you to view the film and the script at the same time.Other Features:- An outstanding metal enclosure for the DVD case.- A thirty page booklet with even more information about this incredible film.
