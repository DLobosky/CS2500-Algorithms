While the sound isn't as good as the Sony V700's or 7506's nor are they are as efficient right now they seem to be of a pretty high standard.  The sound is very flat and not colored.  The imaging in the midrange and treble is only second to the Sony's.  The bass is deep without being overpowering.  Maybe it's redundant to say so, but the whole frequency range if flat and nothing is over powering.I bought these on Amazon and the price I paid was severely discounted from the listed price according to them.  In that sense these are the best headphones in the upper end of the lower price range.  They are a best buy. Not even considering the price they are better than the Sennheiser HD-280's and only "lose" to the Behringer 3000's because they aren't as inexpensive, but in both cases the Audio Technica's are superior in sound.If you need a great pair of headphones.  Don't have a lot of money or don't trust Sony for some reason I would get these.  I would almost say that these are monitor or reference headphones without having tried models on Amazon for more than $100.00.Disclaimer: They only come with a large jack.  They come with a single cord, but it seems somewhat cheap and short and is not coiled.
