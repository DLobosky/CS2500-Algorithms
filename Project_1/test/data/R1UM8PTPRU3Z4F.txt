Got motivated and purchased it this morning and returned it by evening.Wanted to get a compact camera that can do 1080p with a larger display, which would be the two features that my next camera should have, to beat my current Canon Powershot TX1 (which has 720p video and very tiny display). Since, Canon has "disabled optical zooming during 1080p video recording" on all their compact cameras, I had to climb down from the 1080p requirement. On the second spec, the large display on this camera is nice.Here are my issues:1. The black body really looks cheap and fragile. 2. The controls for manual adjustment is very difficult even for my small hand. 3. I have to rotate the dial on top to choose between still shots and movie mode. In my TX1, the shutter button and the video recording buttons are separate and that makes switching between operations a breeze.4. The camera is far heavier than my TX1 and doesn't feel comfortable for video recording.5. A camera with so many features, but no hard copy manual. It is not exactly a point and shoot model and NO MANUAL. You have to print it from the CD-ROM.6. Manual focus feature was new to me on a compact camera and I couldn't get it to do what it claims. I could see the focusing distance bar change, but no change in the image focus.7. You have to MANUALLY pop the built-in flash every time you need the flash! Was this a requirement from the museums that ban flash photography?There are plenty of other features that are not there in my TX1, but they are not a necessity for me.Appended later comments here:My goals for a new compact camera was probably not in line with most buyers/readers. I also own a Canon DSLR and I take that out when I want to shoot flora and fauna. All my cameras from the days of Canon A1 (film SLR) have been Canon. I love the convenience of a compact camera as a single device for both still and high quality video during hikes/camping/skiing/travel/vacation. As I aged, I got a bit tired of lugging my giant Lowepro backpack with all my camera gear. I wish Canon would give me a 1080p camera upgraded from the Canon Powershot TX1 style and with a bigger LCD screen. Currently, Caonon doesn't allow operating the optical zoom while recording in 1080p mode.PS: I did shoot with the camera. It does take nice shots and performs better in low light shooting compared to my TX1.
