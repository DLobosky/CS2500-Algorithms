Every Episode is a cliffhanger. I think that makes the series "The Tudors" so great. I know that most re-creations of History to Film usually insert things that are not factually accurate. However, with "The Tudors", as with the series "Rome", what is added only makes for a fantastic viewing experience leaving the viewer wanting more. I am an avid historian and I know the fact from the fiction yet I rate this so high because of the flow between the two and the anticipation that it leaves me with in waiting for the next episode or season. Unfortunately, this is the last season. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has done an EXCELLENT job of portraying King Henry VIII. I hate to see it go. I recommend that those who haven't already purchased or watched "Elizabeth" and "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" starring Cate Blanchett do so. It picks up with Queen Mary and goes on through the reign of Henry's second daughter, Elizabeth. Both are GREAT movies and are quite inexpensive.
