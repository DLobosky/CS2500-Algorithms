This mom loves the wholesome, Biblical stories that can be taught to my children with such ease and understanding.  The kids catch on right away to the endearing poetry that they catch on to quickly, and soon, remember it, to help finish the sentences after being read through a few times.Who Made the World? begins at the beginning of time, asking questions such as Who made the World? and What was the first thing You made and the last?    "How many days did it take me?    Just six!    I did not need magic    or use any tricks."This newly published 80-paged book is geared for children ages 3-6 and also includes  seven pages for parents called  "Bible References" to go further in depth with Scripture verses to go through with their children in understanding the concepts throughout the book.
