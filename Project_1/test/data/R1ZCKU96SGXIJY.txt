This is a truly remarkable film.  I can add little to the earlier reviews except to note that the VHS version is different from the original.Steiger and Plummer are to my mind spot on.  Wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!  I remember going to the original widescreen version at the Odeon in Leicester Square - a truly widescreen.  My recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring at least two of the "scum of the earth".  Moreover, I have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version.  My hope is that the DVD version when it comes will fully restore this movie...
