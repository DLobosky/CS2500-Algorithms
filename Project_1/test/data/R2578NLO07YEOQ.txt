I can't believe I watched the whole thing!   There are movies that are so bad that they are actually good...well this ain't one of them!  These celebs reached an all time low when they signed on for this garbage.  Clint  Howard, poor, poor, Clint Howard, Ron if you are reading this...get your  brother a real acting gig!   The acting, story, script, and sountrack are  so horrible that in comparison made &quot;Showgirls&quot; look pretty darn  good!   How sad to see people like Olivia Hussey and Jan Micheal Vincent  reduced to such slime.  The effects, I must admit were fairly good, yet  totally twisted.  This movie is so pathetic that the movie &quot;slip  cover&quot; refers to actor David Naughton as Haughton...now that's bad!    Trust me, you will look at ice cream very differently after watching this  gem!
