I opened the box, put the battery in, my sim card and SD card and it worked. Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro:It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo!Cons:* I think there are more buttons than you need, many are repetitious, but they look impressive. Most of the functions take several steps. I work with computers and accessories all day, I am not intimidated by something different. But this was not a well thought out design.* A tiny button on the top opens the camera. It's a very tiny black button, flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push, I used my fingernail when I found it. You can take both photos and video. I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo. The picture it took was good quality.* There are no one step calls as with other phones. There are several ways to make a call which I won't go through, but it is neither easy nor convenient. The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call. The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy. The Sidekick gets an "F" for that. And the same grade for reception. My last phone, a very basic and inexpensive phone, gets reception in places this one can't receive or make a call, like in my house.* I don't think this phone should be categorized under slider, I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move. This doesn't slide, it swivels. * With all the functions they have available, there is only one alarm. * I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm, but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service.* It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do, opening the screen, keystrokes and just about everything. So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up, a multi step process through the menu. When I am at work I turn the volume down, then later when I turn the volume up, it resets all the sounds back on. * Texting is not easy to access, another multi step process. Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text.* There are many buttons, and some just duplicate what others do. It looks impressive, but that's all.* The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps, this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu. Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around, and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them, here, use my phone. You either have to dial for them, or hand them the users manual. Which in this case is a DVD.
