I must say, I enjoyed this &quot;Boogeymen&quot; disk.  It was a lot of fun watching as a different killer popped up on the screen.  The first one is Pinhead (from Clive Barker's Hellraiser) and the last one is Michael Myers (from Halloween).  Some of the killers are very cool, well known horror icons that are actually my very favorite (such as Leatherface, from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street), but others are really stupid and boring- try hard &quot;Boogeymen&quot; (The Guardian, Leprecaun, Candyman).  It's still really great fun watching theses clips.  If you get bored, or have seen one clip to many times, simply skip to the next clip.  However, there weren't nearly as many features as I thought there would be.  There's a cool commentary by Mr. Robert Englund (if you're a true horror fan, then you know who he is!), where he comments about certain movies, and why he likes them.  Occasinily he's very funny, and I felt reasured when he said Freddy vs. Jason WILL happen!  Other extras include a few theatrical trailers (NO theatrical trailer for Jason Goes To Hell The Final Friday, however!  I makes me mad!).  Also are &quot;Flixmix Recommends&quot; where you can watch trailers for The Mummy Returns, American pie 2, and Jurrasic Park 3.  BY THE WAY.....  THERE'S A HIDDEN SCENE FOR &quot;JACK FROST 2&quot;.  Here's how you get to it.  At the top of the Flixmix Recommends menu, there's a little thing that says 'Upcoming Flixmix Titles&quot;.  Highlight this (so that it's green) and press the right arrow on your remote.  Then, it'll say &quot;Jack Frost 2&quot;.  You may have noticed in the movie itself, on the end credits it has cast for &quot;Jack Frost 2&quot;.  If you were wondering why that's there, it's because the scene's hidden.  I hope that helped.  Other extras include a &quot;Legends Of The Boogeymen&quot;, which features breif descriptions of their histories.  You can also watch the movie with &quot;Flixfacts&quot; on.  Flixfacts pop up every scene or so and say things like &quot;It took 500 gallons of fake blood to make Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;.  Nothing to exciting.  For DVD Rom, you get a trivia game, and some cool sound effects.  But, it really nothing so exciting that it's something you must buy.  I don't think so.  There are not THAT many features.  The movie IS only 58 minutes. After you've watched all the scenes and all the trailers, it's kind of silly.  You'll say &quot;Why did I buy that?&quot;  It's a TERRIFIC movie to rent or for a party.  But, why but it?  If you found my review helpful, please vote for me.  Thank you!If you enjoyed Boogeymen The Killer Compilation, I'd recommend Halloween The Extended Edition, Terror In The Aisles, and Friday The 13th.
