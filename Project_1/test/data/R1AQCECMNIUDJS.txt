Eyehategod are there for you.I've gotten bored with overtly costumed Euro metal (Cradle, Dimmu Borgir, Children of Bodom) and growl-laden Death metal (everyone else). That's why Eyehategod is a revelation. No choral breaks or violins. No Cannibal Corpse-type grunting. Just pure aggression. From the opening scream and breaking glass of "My Name Is God (I Hate You)", these guys have you by the throat. No melody, no strict musical form, just the purity of a riff and a scream. Feedback is used to its utmost. Eyehategod is so merciless with their audible limits, they make The Melvins sound like Yes. They always manage to stay heavy, even when they never move above mid-tempo. I'm not too familiar with the "sludge" metal genre, but these guys are just awesome. Be warned - this isn't the kind of music you're gonna be able to turn people onto. "It sounds like it was recorded in a garage." "This guy just screams all the time." Screw 'em, it's good to have heaviness for its' own sake. Hold this CD tight, and it will take you through the darkness. If you are curious about Eyehategod, I strongly recommend this CD. Buy it, play it in your car, and by the third track you'll be screaming into your windshield and running over children. Ah, what fun....Great CD tray photo, too.
