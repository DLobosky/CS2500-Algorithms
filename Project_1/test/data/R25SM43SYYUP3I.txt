I've been playing FPS games since Doom and Wolfenstein, so I really love FPS. Since then, games have changed a lot and the gaming experience of today's FPS is like nothing I've seen before. BF3 is a clear example of that.BF3 is just amazing! The game's sounds effects can't be more realistic. It puts you in the game! My wife even got nervous after hearing all the shooting and screaming, is hilarious. The scenarios, lighting and maps are also very nice! Buildings can collapse on top of you; tanks, rockets and grenades can now alter the actual maps and objects like in real life.Another unique feature of this game that I enjoy a lot if that requires skills from your side! It's not about shooting and shooting or killing and run, like in other FPS game out there. You need to collaborate and play as a team. You get points when you spot an enemy of if other team members spawn on your current shooting place. That is a more balance approach, in my opinion, than focus only on shooting, killing and running. Even shooting long distance with a sniper rifle requires practice and it takes gravity and parabolic  behavior into consideration.The graphics are not as crisp than the PC version (assuming you have good hardware) but developers made a decent job. But blame Sony here. The PS3 console is due for a major hardware upgrade. Sony: it is time for a better and faster console, give us a new model soon!The online gaming is very fluid with no lag at all. I've had no connection issues so far. Ironically, I've been kicked several times of the MW3 servers on recent days than BF3 ones. But let's say that's a temporary thing due too many new users or high demand.-- Now, the "mandatory comparison" with MW3. --Honestly, both games are  great! I have both at home. MW3 is more fast pace shooting game, small maps (some of them a bit claustrophobic to my taste). BF3 is more a team oriented game, collaboration, strategy and maps are huge! If you're into fast pace games and action, you probably will get bored with BF3. However, looking to what we had before and the evolution of the each game, MW3 is more about the same. Activation just "recycled" the exact same successful concept, added new maps, few tweaks here and there, and there you go. But the game's engine is the same, the interaction with the objects and maps is limited or none and the overall gaming experience is more an arcade, non-relalistic one than anything else.-- Conclusion --If you're in a tight budget and tired of being killed by that 11 year old kid that plays 24/7 , get BF3. Has a richer and more realistic FPS experience. But if camping is not your thing, you are a hardcore CoD fan or just prefer a more arcade type of game, CoD MW3 is what you want. I like both games but find myself playing BF3 much more, maybe because the team interaction and bigger maps, but of course, that's just me.
