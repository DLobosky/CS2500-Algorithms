The picture will be substandard on digital, widescreen TVs, compared to even the most basic modern DVD transfers from film. There are film elements in existence that could have been utilized to produce a much better-looking transfer to DVD, but Lucasfilm decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost.  That being said, if it isn't worth their time, why should it be worth yours?Buyer beware.
