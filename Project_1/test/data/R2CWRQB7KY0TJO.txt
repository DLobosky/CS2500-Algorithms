The text has been published as a Greek-English combined version (1976, revised in 1982 and reprinted in 2006) and the English only version. The volume discussed here, published in 2010, is the English only version. The text of this version matches exactly the English in the revised version from 1982, including the same critical apparatus.In case the reader is not aware of the purpose of a Gospel synopsis, the intent is to lay sections (pericopes) of Gospel text that are related next to each other in columns for comparison. Some pericopes are repeated in different sections because they relate to more than one parallel in another Gospel. And, there are different viewpoints taken, such as in the Gospel endings. Each Gospel ending is treated individually which results in 5 views of Gospel endings (the shorter and longer versions of Mark are discussed resulting in 5 views of the endings.) The major portion of the critical apparatus is easy to follow and logical. There are some aspects that I am still unsure about their meaning, but according to reviews of the older version, the apparatus is standard/common. Each pericope is laid out in chronological order, given a title and numbered.One item I found increasingly beneficial is Index of Gospel Parallels. The titles given to each pericope are listed numerically and the verses looked at from each Gospel are listed along with the page number where the pericope can be found. This is followed by an index of Scripture versus which shows where each pericope is used throughout the text. This helps the reader find all instances of a pericope being used.The English text used is the Revised Standard Version (2nd ed, 1971), but the footnotes show variants in the Authorized Version (KJV), the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, and the Catholic version of the Revised Standard Version. The underlying Greek texts used are the UBS 3 and NA 26. The 2010 version of this classic Gospel study tool is bound like a textbook. The binding and pages are sturdy, and the text is easily readable (including the footnotes.) Of the Gospel synopsis texts I have, this is the first in which I turn. I will likely get a copy of the Greek-English later, and would advise that for deeper study. But, for those without a Greek background, this is the first choice, in my opinion.
