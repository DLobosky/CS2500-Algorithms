But I really do enjoy this one as well. Upper body: I tend to neglect my upper body in my workouts, so the idea of a 10 minute routine that I can easily fit in, and covers all the major muscles, is great for me.  If you are looking for a power workout (like Cathe Friedrich) then maybe you won't like this. But really, if you are pressed for time it is great.  Just increase the weight if you need to make it more difficult.  I started with 3 lb weights, but quickly moved up to 5 lb. Will increase weight if it gets easy!Ab routine:  If you are new to working out your abs, or aren't very strong there, this might be too difficult for you.  I was at a moderate level for traditional ab workouts and found this one just a little intense.  So, I went to the routine on the Pilates Plus DVD first, and then once I was comfortable with their style, I went back to the one on this DVD.  Also, if you are looking for a ton of crunches, and aren't open to new ideas, you won't like this. It is all about holding the crunch...for a long time.  But I can tell you, I never saw much difference in my abs from traditional workouts but have noticed a huge difference with the Core Fusion routines. Stretch:  I really like the Core Fusion stretch routines. This one hits the back of the legs nicely, as well as lower back.  When I was younger I wasn't that into stretching, but now that I'm in my 40's I really am. Thighs: Didn't try this one as I'm in physical therapy for my knee and don't want to complicate things.Glutes:  I will admit that I didn't always really feel comfortable with this routine. When they did the bent leg moves I felt like I was doing something wrong. Some of this may be related to my hip dysplasia, but I could have used some more on form on this workout.
