Then USPS delivered the package to your house. Well I have a problem with them ( usps ). Last week I ordered a "Kindle Fire" and they delivered it and dropped it in the hallway and someone stole it. They didn't even knock on my door and in top of that I didlet a note in front of the door with my house phone number. One can imagine when youordered something then you found out that somebody grabbed it. Anyway I called Amazon.com customer service and they say will send me another one which I stillwaiting. I must say that Amazon.com is an excellent Online Store. Well I hoped this info would help someone.Another thing to be aware of is that the estimate delivery that they post is not very accurate. My kindle fire was suppose to arrive in December 6, and the package came inSartuday 3, that's 3 days ahead.Updated on Kindle Fire...Finally, I received the Kindle Fire, this time for UPS. I am very happy.Let me start by saying one can not compare the Kindle fire with the ipad 2, because is not an ipad 2,It is a Kindle Fire from Amazon, a well established and the best online retail store in the world.Kindle Fire is an excellent tablet and at $199 is a bargain. The interface is gorgeousand the graphics look outstanding and fit right at your hands. I truthly recommend it for average user, one can watch video, listen to music, read books, magazines, newspaper, etc. If onedoes not know what gift to give this Holiday season go ahead and grab the Kindle Fire they will be happy. Recommend!
