This book being one of them. The ultimate HTML reference by Ian Lloyd is exactly what it says, a reference guide. Although I've read the book cover to cover it is meant more as a reference book than a straight read. The book covers every single HTML/XHTML tag and corresponding attribute known (including some that aren't even in the official ratified HTML standard but are supported by certain browsers, mainly during the browser wars from a few years ago) from HTML version 1 right through to HTML 4.01 and also includes XHTML through version 1.1.  Unfortunately you won't find any HTML 5 or XHTML 2.0 tags or extensions in the book but that is mainly because these haven't been ratified by the W3C yet. The book is very well laid out with each each attribute to a tag immediately following the tag and a quick reference stating exactly what tag the attribute is associated with (which is handy for a reference guide). Next to this is a quick reference stating whether or not the tag or attribute has been deprecated, whether it's required, the version of HTML or XHTML that it was introduced and a quick browser support reference stating whether it's fully supported by the browser, partially supported, not supported at all or whether the implementation is buggy for a particular browser.  This is followed by a description of what the tag or attribute does, any values that it takes followed by a more complete browser compatibility list. The list covers the major browsers that are currently out from IE5.5 through IE7, Firefox 1.0 through 2.0, Safari 1.3 through 3.0 and Opera 9.2. This is followed by a brief description of any compatibility issues as listed finally followed by a list of other relevant tags or attributes.  As with any book of this nature, basically it is out of date virtually as it's printed. With Firefox 3.0 and Opera 9.5 just being released and Internet Explorer 8.0 just around the corner, however there are mentions of these scattered throughout the book e.g. the "X-UA-Compatible" attribute of the http-equiv that was introduced with IE8. Unfortunately since the book went to print Microsoft have changed their mind and this tag is no longer necessary to put IE8 into full compatibility mode as it will ship in that mode as default. There are also numerous references to web articles like RFC's that the reader can use for further information should they be inclined. Also there are tips as to what CSS styling you should use instead if an attribute be deprecated. This leads me to one of my biggest complaints about this good. Reading through it you just get the feeling that as well as the HTML/XHTML reference, there should also be a CSS reference. It just seems so natural a fit to this type of book, however as the title suggests this book only covers HTML/XHTML. As such Ian Lloyd has done an insanely outstanding job of providing all the information you could ever want about any HTML element or attribute. This is definitely a book that will be sitting on my desk and one that I will dip into every now and again and one that you should have too.  I just hope that there is a companion book in the works detailing CSS in the same manner.
