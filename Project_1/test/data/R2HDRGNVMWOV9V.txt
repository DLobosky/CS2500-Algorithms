It's rather like a cycling version of the Autobahn track from their classic album Autobahn. All of the songs on the CD have a nice sound to them, it's easy to relax too, yet at the same time, I can imagine cycling to it as well. I wasn't sure if I would like this as much as their older stuff, but it turned out to be great. (This review is for the 2003 edition titled Tour De France Soundtracks, however, this is not truly a remaster but a repressing as it was already recorded on high quality digital equipment. I believe the only difference here is the tracks are divided up slightly different where they flow together)
