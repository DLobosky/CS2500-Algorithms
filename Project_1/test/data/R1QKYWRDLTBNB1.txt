 Let's start with the characters.  Jack Bauer is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time.  I just love his courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice (which we don't really see in this season).  In just about every season of the show, Jack gets messed over at the end.  But that never stops him.  In the next season, he's back and ready to serve his country again.  He goes into these situations knowing he could get hurt, but he cares about his country more than he cares about himself.  He gives whatever he has to to protect it.  Now let's get into some of the other characters.  I love David Palmer.  He is a senator running for mayor.  There is a terrorist group trying to kill him.  Why?  He's a black man running for president.  But is that really why they want him dead?  Another character I love is Tony Almeida.  I didn't care for him too much in this season, but as time goes on, he gets better.  Nine Myers was another character I initially liked.  She's fiercely loyal to Jack and does whatever he tells her to do with no questions asked, even if she knows she could get into trouble or lose her job.  There's an interesting twist to how her character turns out in this season.  I don't want to give anything away in case some of you guys haven't seen this yet, but man, that thing with her at the end of this season, wow.  Probably the most surprising twist of the entire series.  I actually liked Kim in this season.  I know I could get killed for that, but I didn't really have a problem with her.  Many people hate her character, and I can see why, but for some reason she didn't really bother me.  The only character in this season who I was supposed to like and disliked was Teri.  Some people liked her, but I couldn't stand her.  They try to make her the strong mother who will do anything to protect her child, but to me she just came across as the na?e woman who stupidly gets into danger that anyone with half a brain could avoid.  I couldn't stand David Palmer's wife Sherry, and I wasn't supposed to like her.  She is an overbearing, power-hungry, manipulative woman who is obsessed with getting her husband into the white house at any cost.  I loved to hate her.
 
 As far as the plot goes, it was probably the simplest of all the seasons in the series.  The bad guys want to kill Jack and Palmer.  Wheras the other seasons usually had the bad guys doing some complicated act of terrorism, this season just has this one plotline.  Jack has to protect himself, his family, and David Palmer by finding out who is after them and why.  The villians in this season were amazing.  Ira Gaines, the villian for the first half of the season, is one of my top three villians of the whole series.  His performance, incredible.  Victor Drazen, played by Dennis Hopper and serving as the villian for the second half of the season, was not quite as good.  It wasn't because of his acting or the way he was written.  It was simply because the guy could not do a slavic accent.  That kind of ruined all the good lines he had, and made him look like less of a threatening villian.  But he was still okay, in my opinion.  His obsession with killing Jack made him kind of scary despite his horrible accent.
 
 To recap, this is my favorite season of my all-time favorite show.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, and it was so intense that I just could not stop watching it.  I watched this entire season in two days.  It was that good.  As a side note, this season has probably the least amount of action out of the series.  It was more about the suspense than the action.  That's one of the reasons I love it.
