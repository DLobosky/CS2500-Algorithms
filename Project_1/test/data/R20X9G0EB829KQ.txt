The brown colored strip along the bottom didn't deter me.The box was missing the remote, hardware and manual.  It looked to me like it had been taped shut a couple times before.  Rather than asking for the missing stuff or exchanging it, I bailed.  With a fouled order, I didn't want to risk another incident.  I just got an LG DVD player, the one intended to be used with this TV.  I'm not down on LG products in general.
