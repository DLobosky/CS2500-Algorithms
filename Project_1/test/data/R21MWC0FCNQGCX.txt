I wanted something small that would fit under a table or love seat so my choices were limited.  I first tried the Yamaha FSW-050.  The size was perfect but the love affair ended there.  It was very boxy sounding and had no adjustable crossover.  I could not get it sounding to my liking so I decided to return it and purchase the Velodyne Impact-Mini.  Having a big 15" Velodyne that I love in my home theater, I hoped the Velodyne would impress and it would certainly be better than the Yamaha.  I had no idea how much better though and frankly, I wasn't expecting too much because how much bass can you get from a 6.5" driver, right?.  All I can say is WOW!  This little sub is not cheap but it is truly amazing for its size and I'm glad I spent the extra money!The impact-Mini has a 180W RMS (300W Peak), Class D amplifier coupled with a 6.5" aluminum driver and 8" passive radiator.  This allows this sub to produce amazingly low, tight bass from such a small box.  I have it hooked up via the line level inputs to the subwoofer output of a Yamaha CRX-330BL CD Receiver.  Once tip I will give anyone purchasing this sub is to buy an RCA Y adapter (1 RCA female to 2 RCA male).  If you hook it up to the LFE output of a receiver without a Y adapter, you will not get a lot of output.  Adding the Y adapter will increase the output of the sub significantly.  The sub also has speaker level inputs, a reverse phase switch, volume and variable crossover.  The sub detects when there is a signal and turns on automatically.  It turns off automatically if no signal is detected after 8 minutes.  Because the sub turns on and off automatically when it detects a signal input is another reason to use a Y adapter.  Without it, the sub may not turn on when you are listening to music softly.  I can't tell you how much I love this sub.  It completely fills my 12' x 20' room with smooth, deep bass.If you want REALLY low bass, nothing beats a big sub but if space is limited, this is the best small sub I have ever heard.  It rivals the performance of many 8", 10" or even 12" subs.
