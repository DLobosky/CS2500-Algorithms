Dexter has a code and he tries to stick to it. He only kills serial killers. While doing this he has a job in the forensics department of the Miami Police Dept. He also has a social life of sorts with his girlfriend and her two children. I was happy to see this show wasn't just about drugs and drug dealers as I thought it might be since it takes place in Miami. You don't much care what the police are doing though since you are mostly just waiting to see what Dexter is going to do next. He thinks he isn't normal (what serial killer is!) so he starts doing the normal thing and gets him a nice girlfriend with two children. He may be a killer but he sure is good to his girlfriend and her kids. He's also a true friend to his friends and foster sister Deb. No matter who he kills or what he does, you can count on this...sister Deb, girlfriend Rita, and his audience will be rooting for him and defending him to the hilt. The show has its humorous moments and it's just great! You can watch seasons 1 and 2 from netflix and season 3 from video on demand from amazon or direct tv if you don't want to buy the discs.
