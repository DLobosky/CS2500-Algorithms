UltraViolet digital download is no good, you have to create accounts and it will not work with itunes. In order to watch the movie on your computer you have to download a software, you can only watch using their software or stream onto devices. I made the mistake of purchasing the Green Lantern with UltraViolet and learned the hard way. Buy just the BluRay.
