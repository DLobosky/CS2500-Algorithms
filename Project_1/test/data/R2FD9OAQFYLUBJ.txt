Ordered late Monday, arrived Thursday along with 4 other components using standard shipping. The remaining all showed up Friday. As usual, Amazon did a great job combining orders and I paid maybe $30 shipping in total, for everything. I installed the following, and this part was compatible:ASUS P8Z68-V/Gen3 motherboardIntel Core i5-2500K CPUCooler Master Hyper 212 EVO CPU Cooler (RR-212E-20PK-R1)Antec Nine Hundred Two V3 caseCorsair 60GB Force Series 3 SATA III 6Gb/s 2.5 inch SSDLite-On Lightscribe 24x SATA DVDWD Caviar Black 500 GB SATAIII 7200 RPM 32 MB cache OEMCorsair TXM V2 Series 650W 80+ Bronze modular power supplyWindows 7 64 bit OEMCorsair Vengeance Low Profile 8 GB PC3 1600 mhz DDR3 memoryMy old WD HDD SATAII 7200 RPM from previous PCMSI GeForce GTX560 Ti 1GB DDR5 Twin Frozr II OCFit and finish was perfect.  Nice action on the tray.  Everything plugged in just right. Came with everything I needed to install.
