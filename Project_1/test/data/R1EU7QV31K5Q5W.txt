You get a book, explaining each meditation section, as well as background information about meditation.  The CD has several meditation practices on it, and you are encouraged to journal your feelings after each meditation.**the variety of meditations.  Everything from breathing, to walking to vipassana meditations are covered.**Sharon's matter-of-factness about meditation realities.  She reassures you that it's very common for your mind to wander during practice.What really missed the mark with this set:**Both Sharon Salzberg and Joseph Goldstein have very grating, very unpleasant sounding voices.  These voices really detract from the meditation experience.  It's hard to ignore them!  Meditation is supposed to help you relax and free your mind.  A soothing, calming voice is a critical part of the process.  While I really appreciate what Sharon and Joseph have created here, they should have used someone with a better voice to guide the meditations.The annoying voices is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  That being said, I do recommend this product as a good introduction to meditation.
