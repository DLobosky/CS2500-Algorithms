This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!
