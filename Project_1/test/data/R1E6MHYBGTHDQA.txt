Who would have thought that from an abandoned quail's egg so much personality and affection would hatch out?  Yet that is precisely what happened on Cape Cod back in 1962, as chronicled with love and honesty by the author. What happens when the human world becomes a substitute for Nature?  Is the orphaned wild creature better off with its own kind, or with an adoptive family of a different species?  Readers must judge for themselves in this charming tale about a delightful female quail, misnamed Robert.   Written with humor and pathos by an observant neighbor, who became Robert's Aunt and longterm hostess, this slim volume is a gem about surprising family adjustments.  Human emotions seem to have rubbed off on this impressionable birdling, who rapidly becomes a member of the family--even to requiring babysitters.  You will chuckle and weep over her antics and trials.  How human can a bird get?  Once you spend some quality time with personable and endearing Robert, you will know the truth for yourself!
