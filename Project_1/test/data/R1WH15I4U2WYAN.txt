This is the first time that I have given any book review a 3.  And I have reviewed many of them, in the past year.  They have all been 5, because they all really are off the charts.  But, having read &quot;Open Your Mind to Prosperity,&quot; I had expected &quot;Prosperity Secrets of the Ages,&quot; to offer me more, when what I found was that this book is a reformat of her other books.I was so excited about &quot;Open Your Mind to Prosperity,&quot; that I believed that reading another of Ms. Ponder's books, would keep me thinking the thoughts that I need to think to be prosperous.  But, I believe that buying one of her books, and choosing to read it again, and again is a better investment of my time, thoughts and vision.What keeps this from being rated a 2 is that in thinking about tithing to my church, which Ms. Ponder advises us to do, I am rethinking my choice in churches, because I have asked myself whether or not I am receiving the level of spiritual growth from my church that I desire to receive; and whether or not my church has the social system that could offer me what I desire.
