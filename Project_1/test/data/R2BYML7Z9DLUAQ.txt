The author does provide more than a few unique insights in different ways on the subject then other authors to date that more than makes for the lack of breaking new ground.  If you have not been introduced to some of our hardwired tendencies previously, then this book is as good as any place to start and worthy of the purchase.  I enjoyed the author's writing style for this genre and it was an enjoyable read.If you are interested in this genre of cognitive psychology, then a few of may other favorites on the subject include:Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition by Michael J.
