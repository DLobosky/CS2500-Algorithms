I had no idea what kind of book this was. I assumed (you know what happens when you do that) that it was like the previous in the series. Well, it is not. And when I opened the package I was upset. I did use coupons, etc., to bring the cost of the book down, but still, I had paid over (dollar amount) for what looked to be a HEAVILY illustrated coffee table book with much less content. Still, I am halfway through, I'm trying to take my time, and I am enjoying it. I give it a three for two reasons...so far, it is better than decent but not great (I have every book in the series), and also, I do not think this book is worth the list price, or anywhere near it. If I would have paid (dollar amount) I probably would have given the book a four, but no more than that. Of course, you will have to judge the content for yourself, you may enjoy it more than me. I will say this, I feel almost guilty rating this book a three, however, this is one that I believe may end up in the bargain bin at your local book store in a few months. Still, if you are a discworld fan, you must buy it, so just try to buy it cheap.
