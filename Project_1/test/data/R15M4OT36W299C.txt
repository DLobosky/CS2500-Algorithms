I read about this problem from previous customer reviews, but decided to purchase it anyway, hoping perhaps my scanner would be dust-free. Nope. Thank goodness for Photoshop's Dust &amp; Scratches filter which puts a band-aid on the problem, but obviously does not cure it. Methinks a replacement scanner is warranted...
