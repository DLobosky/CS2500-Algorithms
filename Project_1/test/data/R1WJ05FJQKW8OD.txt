Most or all of those psychics died, we are not sure how or why.  The government agency has been watching the children of the psychics called Offspring.  The agency doesn't want the Offspring to know about each other.  Lucas is an Offspring who can see into the future and enter other people's dreams.  He has been entering Amy's dreams for years.  When he visits Amy for the first time, the agency arrests him and conducts drug experiments on him.  Amy learns that she is an Offspring, and she meets two of Lucas's friends who are also Offspring.  Most of the story is the threesome evading government people, trying to learn about their parents and other Offspring and trying to rescue Lucas from his imprisonment.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is the first book in a series by author Jaime Rush.  She previously wrote books under the name Tina Wainscott.  This book did not interest me enough to buy the sequel.  The theme of the story was "good guys being victims."  I didn't feel any satisfying closure at the end.  The bad guys were still out there and getting stronger.  There were no details revealed about the bad guys or their history which bothered me.  There was no revenge against the bad guys or solving the mystery.  (Ok, I will admit some mysteries were solved in order to make a story, but not the significant ones.)  The Offspring still didn't know much about their parents.  It ended with the victims planning to work together against the bad guys in future books.  There were too many unanswered questions.  I was disappointed with the last page which had two cliffhangers.  I was also annoyed with the frequent use of cliffhangers at the end of several chapters.  For example on page 299, Petra is running from the bad guys, she turned.  "One of the guards broke into view, his gun aimed at her."  The next sentence is a scene with other characters in another place.  Six pages later, the author returns to the Petra scene.  I would have preferred that Petra either gets caught and locked up or is in the car driving away free, and then end the scene.  I prefer suspense due to action and events, not through artificial cliffhangers.  I'm willing to accept occasional use, but not as many as the author used.There is no personality development or relationship development between Lucas and Amy.  They just know they are in love with each other, even though they have never met, except in their dreams.  I didn't mind this, but I only mention it because some readers might prefer more character or romantic development than what was here.On the positive side, it did hold my interest.  I wanted to see what would happen.  The characters were interesting due to their skills.DATA:Story length: 367 pages.  Swearing language: moderate.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 4.  Total number of sex scene pages: 8.  Setting: current day Annapolis, Maryland.  Copyright: 2009.  Genre: paranormal romantic suspense.  CAUTION SPOILER:The characters had potential due to their skills, but it didn't happen, for example: I had a hard time believing that Lucas didn't use his powers to escape or do something interesting to his captors.  He was able to enter someone's dreams, see their thoughts, communicate with them, and kill them.  Darkwell requested that Lucas kill other people in their sleep who were supposed enemies of the government.  I ask: why didn't Lucas enter Darkwell's dreams and see that Darkwell was planning to kill Lucas?  Lucas could have mentally killed, made unconscious, or done something else interesting to Darkwell and the guards and then escape.  Lucas could have threatened one of the guards by claiming he would harm a family member unless the guard helped him get free.  Instead, Lucas killed the guys Darkwell wanted him to and continued being a prisoner.  There was potential for something interesting here instead of continuing the victim theme.
