The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows. I use the surround tracks and prefer DTS if a choice is available.Unfortunately not every recording gives me that feeling of being there.In the case of the magic flute (LPCM 5.1), the orchestra is recorded ok, but the sound field does not really go much beyond the corner speakers. The surround speakers are not much used for the orchestra.While the voices are recorded pretty clear, they are coming mostly from  the left speaker. The applause on the other hand, is mostly sent to the right speakers. This gives the impression as if you sit at the left side balcony of the theater where you would have the music to your left and the audience/applause to the right. But you sit in the middle as far as the orchestra is concerned. Makes no sense to me and detracts from the performance. Then it dawned on me: The voices are sent to the wrong speakers! Everything is one off to the left. What ought to go to the center goes to the left front speaker. What should go to the left front goes to the left surround etc. The applause, that was mend to be the 2 surrounds ends up at the right front and right surround. How can Opus Arte release this one? Then I switched to stereo and the sound is how you would expect it, everything from the front and the voices in the middle.Another example of how poor the audio part of blu rays can be.It would probably get five stars if the speaker assignment was correct, so only one star.EDIT1: OA confirmed the fault in an e-mail to me on 2/25/2011 End of editEDIT2 of 7/9/2011: Received the corrected version of the Magic Flute from OA on 7/8/2011. Applause is now from the surrounds and voices from the center. The Id-# on the inner ring is A0101759536-A911.If your LPCM Multi track has the applause from the right front and right surround, you have the defective disc (#A0100907890-B911)
