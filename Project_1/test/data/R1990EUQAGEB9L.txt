I bought &quot;61*&quot; on a whim.  I have a soft spot for baseball movies, and it was the first one I happened upon when I bought it.  What a surprise!  This movie is, hands down, the best baseball movie I've seen in a long time.  Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane pull at your hearts while they portray M&amp;M.  You'll want to cheer Maris on in hopes that he'll break the Babe's record in time for his home run talley to be the &quot;official&quot; record(not the one with an asterisk).  This isn't one of those giant vs. the underdog type movies, it's a giant vs. a giant, albeit one of them is a gentle giant in a game that has always had its share of outlandish stars.  Mr. Crystal does not disgrace either of the heroes in this film.  If you loved Mantle before this film, you'll have no ill feelings toward him afterward.  As for Maris, Pepper's portrayal of him will make you want to cherish Roger even more.  Go out, buy this movie, watch it, and then add it to the top of your baseball collection, preferably somewhere between &quot;The Natural&quot; and &quot;Eight Men Out.&quot;  This movie is definitely a bright spot for baseball's legacy.
