This is more a rating and review of several of Ms Armstrong's books.  Ms Armstrong writes revisionist or biased history in a lot of her books.  I agree with a previous reviewer, Ms Armstrong never, in any of her books, truly presents the horrific deeds of the Muslims.  Glossed over, or merely mentioned in most of her books are the murders of Muslim leaders by other leaders, the capturing of hundreds of thousands of non-Muslims, then making them not only slaves, but soldiers in their army, as with the Jannissaries.  The Muslim invasion of Europe is presented as a glorious event of all-embracing love and toleration for non-Muslims, without mentioning how they built their society in Spain.  Had it not been for Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours the Muslims would have spread Islam by the bloody sword all over Europe.  I wonder how many innocent Christians and Jews Ms Armstrong would estimate might have died had the Muslims won at Tours and proceeded spreading the Muslim gospel throughout Europe?  Ms. Armstrong does mention the murder of Muslim leaders and descendants of Muslim leaders in the "wars" for leadership, but she never treats it with the same venom she uses when she "bites" the Christians in her attacks on them.  It has become fashionable for many so-called intellectuals and authors to chastise Christianity.  If space would allow I'd list a few books for Ms Armstrong to read about the good that Christianity, including the Catholic Church, has done throughout history.  Maybe she, and others, can start with "Under the Influence" and "Christianity on Trial", both available here.After the First Crusade there wasn't much more than  a pretext of being Christian anyway.  The reasons for going on the Crusades were anything but pious.I wonder if it ever ocurred to Ms Armstrong that the Muslims had no more right in the Holy Land than did the Christians.  It wasn't their land either.  I do not condone the  actions of the Crusaders in the Holy Land or the sacking of Constantinople, or the cannibalism practiced by some crusaders.  I'm aware of all that.  However, the Christians had every reason to be alarmed that their holy sites were being taken over by Muslims.  So did the Jews.  There were no innocent Muslim invaders.  Did this ever occur to her or the rest of the Muslim apologists?I know many Muslims and like them very much.  There are many good things about Islam, and there are many good Muslims.  In fact, many of the Muslims I know are embarrassed by much of what the Muslim leaders have done, today and throughout history.  If they can be honest, why can't Ms Armstrong?Ms. Armstrong's book are easy reading, mostly good history, and very interesting.  I just wish she would tell it like it is with all parties concerned.
