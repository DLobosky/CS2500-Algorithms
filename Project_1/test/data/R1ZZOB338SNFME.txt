They primarily enjoyed the winsome detective, the local color of the French village, the interweaving of past history with contemporary events, the humor, the rich writing and the originality of the plot.Of all the mysteries this group has read BRUNO CHIEF OF POLICE is one of two that everyone enjoyed--the other was the first Julia Spencer-Fleming book featuring the woman Episcopalian priest.  The mystery is quite satisfying and surprising; although the book has light elements, there are deep undercurrents which make the book multi-dimensional and hard to classify in a mystery genre.  Maybe it's creating its own niche. The group indicated they will be reading more of Martin Walker's mysteries.  If your book group is looking for a fun jaunt through a French village with some history to learn and a mystery to solve, this book should be considered as a tasty alternative to the usual book club fare.
