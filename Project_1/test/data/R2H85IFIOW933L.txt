The group was doing so loud talking making certain comments regarding Yasmine which she tried to hold on to her temper and the more the group was talking the madder Yasmine would get but what really pissed her off was the fact that Cecil heard all of the comments he did nothing to defend of honor his take on the situation is that they didn't mean anything by it they was only teasing her once she saw that Cecil was not going to do anything she said enough is enough.  Yasmine got up and went over to the table ready to cuss those guy out but when she got ready to open her mouth Rashawn Bishop step between the table and Yasmine and made the guys at the table apoligize to Yasmine.After that she got her purse and left the restaurant and while she was outside waiting on her car Cecil come running out of course trying to make everything already.
