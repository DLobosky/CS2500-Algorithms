It involves people from two shows I love, Black Books and Look Around You and I can say if you like that type of humor, you will like the IT Crowd.  If you work in IT, you will love it more. I mean, critics say oh the "have you turned it on and off" line isn't funny...but have any of those people worked in IT?  Probably not.  Most computer problems can be solved by turning the computer on and off or plugging it in.  And this is why it is to frustrating for IT people to talk to the normals upstairs and they seem to always be in a dark room or basement.The actors are so funny. Moss, Roy, Jen, the ignorant bosses and the goth guy Richmond, who is locked away in the IT's dungeon. I find it witty and original.  Whoever said the laughter is canned, it isn't. They show it being filmed in front of an audience, it's real sound.  They truly jump into their character roles without being too cliche.  The jokes come at you a mile a minute too.  Even the minor characters are great.  There is also a lot of Mighty Boosh crossovers here, namely Noel Fielding and Richard Ayoade...so fans of that would find this show worthwhile too.  It's got about the same vibe, though the IT Crowd is a lot less surreal.  Where Mighty Boosh can be hit or miss, the IT Crowd is always on target. Haven't seen even a just ok episode yet, which is amazing to me.  It reminds me a lot of the wonderful Black Books, where every show was worthwhile and hilarious. It has ideas that other comedy shows don't try...like cannibalism or making light of car crash victims or doing a Russian movie parody of smokers.  To me, if you have a sense of humor that is not witty or cynical, you might as watch The Big Bang Theory, which isn't that funny at all. I think they actually copied from the IT Crowd and put a hot girl into the  mix instead of a Jen type, but I am so smitten by pale English girls that look normal, that appeals a lot more to me than what a "hot"girl is.  To me, the hot, overly tan, dumb lead girl is so clique.  Jen has smarts, even if she doesn't know what IT means.  She shows it in other ways and isn't a cliche. None of the characters, even Richmond, is a total cliche.  That is why it is refreshing to watch.   So watch it! But what I like most in the work put into the DVD. All the graphic scenes are well done and run for a really long time. You can get a chuckle out of the graphics as well as the episodes.  The menus are awesome, the Russian graphic/cigarette Tetris is great, the Street Fighter parodies are awesome, wait for it at least four times, you won't be disappointed. Whomever did the graphic work on this really took the show into consideration.  The commentary is good as well, found out a lot about the show and motivations of its writer/director.
