The picture is great but the volume could be better.  The volume goes from 1-100 & most of the time we have it up to about 70 or so & you'd think it would be pretty loud at that # but it's not.  There are times we want it louder but are afraid we're going to blow the speakers or something.  Even at 100 it would not be loud enough sometimes.  The speakers are in the back of this TV so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it but if you have surround sound you'll probably be fine but if not be advise that the volume may seem a bit lower than you're expecting.  The design of this TV is great. It's a nice TV to look at. My only other complaint would be that it's not as fast to change channels or to go from cable to game mode very fast. It would be nice to be able to assign one button to switch back & forth between just those two (or whatever your needs are). Setup was fast and easy. I would recommend this TV.  We like it quite a bit.
