After Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers, and Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween H20 was a much needed installment for the series. With the last two films the series had started to take a slow decline, and H20 attempts to correct the mistakes the last films made, while taking Myers effectively into the new decade. It's been said before, but this is truly the best sequel in the series since Halloween II. It definitely has the classic feel that made the first two movies genuienly creepy, as well as great direction. That's the key, where as the last two films tended to focus on excessive (and sometime ridiculously stupid) violence, and completely confusing stories, Halloween H20 takes the series back to its basics and returns to what made the films scary in the first place; suspense. While it's not the best the series has ever offered (that honor of course belongs to the original) Halloween H20 is miles ahead of anything that was attempted in Halloween 4-6, and will definitely restore faith in anyone who thought the series was dying off slow and painfully.Finally the story in a Halloween movie is clear. Forget anything that took place in Halloween 4-6. Halloween H20 completely erases those events (which I don't necessarily agree with, but hey it works) and picks up twenty years after the end of the second film. Apparently Michael Myers' body was never found at the scene of the accident in the last movie, which lead Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to fake her death and change her name and location to attempt to allude her brother, whom she believes is still alive. However after the death of Dr. Loomis, Myers has aquired papers from Loomis' home explaining exactly what his sister has been up to in the last twenty years. With that in hand he travels to California where Laurie is now the head of a secluded private school, and working under the name Keri Tate. And from there the fun insues. There are a couple of strange moments in the plot, mainly that the story leads you to believe at first that Myers true target is Laurie's son John (Josh Hartnett), although he quickly disappears before the movie is over. For the most part the scenes are extremely suspenseful (especially when Myers is trying to get into the gate when John and his girlfriend are outside Laurie's house), and the direction really creates some great moments throughout the film. The acting is better than anything seen in the last three movies, mainly because of Jamie Lee Curtis' return, although her performance isn't nearly as powerful as the original (but it can be forgiven). Cleaning up the story as well made the film a lot better, because there's no confusion about what's going on; Michael is there to kill Laurie Strode, and anyone else who gets in his way. The cast plays their parts especially well, including Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams, and even LL Cool J (although his character is ridiculously stupid in this movie). The real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis though. She definitely adds a whole new dimension to the film because her acting is one of a kind, and having her return to do this film makes it feel more like the original.While it's not the best the series has seen, and it definitely has it's flaws, Halloween H20 is way ahead of anything that 4-6 tried to do. I was glad to see the series get back on track with this one. If you were a fan of the original Halloween or any of the later sequels, I think you'll find yourself pleasently surprised by this one. My expectations for this film were pretty low considering what I had to go on off of Halloween 5 and 6, but it went above and beyond anything I believed it could have. Too bad Halloween: Resurrection effectively killed everything this movie accomplished, but no matter. Even without Resurrection this film stands on its own as a great addition to the Halloween family.
