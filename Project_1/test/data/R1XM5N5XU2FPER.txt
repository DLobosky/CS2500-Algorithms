Excellent box set.  A must have for any fan and great television for anyone that hasn't seen it.  You get hooked.  James Cameron is a genius.  Also,  this show had the best supporting cast I've seen in a long time.  Original and diverse.  I miss the show and long for a conclusion.  Buy it TODAY!!!  --Don't forget about the books either. Great reading--
