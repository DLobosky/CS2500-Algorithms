I recently bought this pocket bible for my girlfriend. (She preferred one with the snap closure). There is no question that its a compact edition. It is a little over 6 inches tall and about 5 inches wide, but a hefty 1.3 inches thick.  Although I have to agree with many of the other reviewers about the print being small, it still is larger than many I picked up and thumbed through at the local book store here.  The selection there of bibles around this size had very small print to be sure.  But most were no as thick as this one, adherent to this editions larger print.  The font size is not exactly large, but larger than normal for sure for a bible this size.  As far as this editions quality, I feel it is excellent for the price.  The genuine burgundy leather cover is attractive, thick, and easy to open and close with the snap.  And the pages are also of high quality with good solid black print, and the Lords words in red.  The Holman translation of the bible is very clear and easy to read and I feel it is easily on a par and similar to the more well known New International Version.  The price on this very handsome bible is reasonable, the print is decent size for its dimensions, and the HCSB translation is excellent in my opinion.  I highly recommend it for a good quality pocket size edition of the holy book...
