This event, among others, forced her to reevaluate her relationship with money. Lost and Found serves as a helpful companion to Roth's #1 New York Times Bestseller, Women, Food and God. She admits, "My relationship to money was no different from my relationship to food, to love, to fabulous sweaters: Because I was never aware of what I already had, I never felt as if I had enough. I was always focused on the bite that was yet to come, not the one in my mouth. I was focused on the way my husband wasn't perfect, not the way he was. And on the jacket I saw in the window, not the one in my closet that I hadn't worn for a year." Roth's statemet reminds me of a statement in the Old Testament: "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income" (Ecclesiastes 5:10). King Solomon, the likely author of Ecclesiastes, notes that chasing appetites is often like chasing smoke: once you grab it, it evaporates. We never become fully satisfied by what we consume (eating, spending, etc.). Lost and Found is divided into two main sections: (I) The Way We Eat is the Way We Spend and (II) Cash and Consciousness. Roth is characteristically open, honest, and confessional. She speaks candidly about her mistakes, fears, bad habits, debt, and shame. She offers helpful suggestions for her readers to enjoy a balanced view of money (and of life). Roth shines a bright light on what many of us want to keep hidden: our irrational tendency to overspend (indulge, binge), feel guilty (ashamed), and then retreat into a siege mentality (hoarding, self-deprivation, etc.) when it comes to basic purchases. This, as she notes, produces significantly negative effects on the health of our relationships, emotions, and of course, our finances. Lost and Found is a well written, fast-paced book. This is a great introduction to Roth's life and work, and also a helpful resource for those who want to gain control over their addiction to consumption. In 2009, Timothy Keller published a very helpful book that deals with these topics as well. His book, Counterfeit Gods: The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope that Matters, provides a distinctly Christian perspective on the dangers of money (food, family, etc.) as an idol.
