Consternation - did the Greek original actually have words like that? It was a 'modern' translation - 'modern' as in 'dumbing down'. So I went looking for another translation, only 40 years old, but more faithful to the original, as in 'think of your many years of procrastination' rather than 'if you keep putting things off'. I don't view it as 'colloquial', I view it as patronising. I'm sorry, but if you can't handle good English, and need the 'dumber' versions, then you're probably too dumb to appreciate the finer points of the work in the first place. Both versions were the same price, so that didn't influence my decision. One reviewer mentioned it was translated from the Greek, and another reviewer corrected them as he was a Roman. If the second person had actually read the book correctly, he would have discovered that this book was written in Greek - thus another mark of the man.Then you can sit back and invest your time in truly enjoying the thoughts & the musings of this interesting man.
