A year later she calls; and instead of hearing his voice message, she hears him saying different words among a lot of static.  This happens a few times during the story.  Annie makes a living baking cookies for a caterer and selling art sculptures.  She also occasionally waitresses for the caterer.  At one of the catered events, she meets Thom.  Thom finds her wedding ring the next day and returns it to her where he meets her children.  He's a wealthy bachelor who is tired of wealthy women and gold diggers.  He is drawn to Annie, but she is grieving too much and feels she will never be free to love another man.Opinion:I loved Thom.  Annie was ok but I was annoyed with some of her thinking and actions.  I was delighted and charmed with Thom and Annie's first day together.  But I was soon let down by too much pondering and second guessing within the minds of both of the characters.  Annie kept thinking Andre wouldn't want her to be with Thom.  I was tired of Annie continuing to be sad and refusing to act on her feelings for Thom.  I was also frustrated with Thom making his own inaccurate assumptions about Annie, telling himself she doesn't want to see him for this or that reason.  More action, conversation and events would have been better.  The part about Andre's ghost communicating with Annie also could have been better developed.  I did not like Annie's inconsistencies.  She believed Andre's ghost was talking to her via the telephone, but she wouldn't believe that his ghost was talking to her two children at night.  Both children told Annie that Andre's ghost had said the same thing to each one of them separately.  Yet she refused to believe them.  I was also disappointed with something that wasn't answered.  Erika told Annie to put on some of Erika's perfume.  Annie chose the honeysuckle oil.  Later Erika said she didn't own any honeysuckle fragrance.  That mystery was never answered.  There were two sex scenes which were nice but don't expect typical romance novel details.  They were told rather than shown.Data:Story length: 372 pages.  Swearing language: mild.
