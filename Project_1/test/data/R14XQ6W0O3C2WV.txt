This was the first Rushdie book that I have read, but I am very impressed.  He has an amazing knack for storytelling.  It was evident that he had a plan in mind when he began writing the book rather than just letting the story meander without purpose like some authors are prone to do.  This is the story of a boy named Haroun who tries to help his father, a storyteller, regain his ability to tell stories.  His father had always told him that his storytelling abilities came from something called the "Sea of Stories".  Haroun was surpised to find that this was, in fact a real sea located on the earth's elusive 2nd moon.  Haroun travels there and is acquainted with magnificent characters such as the Water Genie, the flying mechanical bird the Hoopoe, the Shadow Warrior (who's shadow has a personality of it's own), Pages that look like pages.  The book wouldn't be complete without a villain:  Kattam Shud.  It's the age-old story of good versus evil with a new twist.  It's also a fanciful explanation of where good stories come from and how good stories get tainted.  The book is quick-paced and can be read in 3 to 4 short sittings.  It's not so much suspenseful as it is refreshing and enjoyable.  However, why does Rushdie use apostrophes instead of quotation marks during dialogue?
