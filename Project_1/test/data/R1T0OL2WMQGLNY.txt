I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly unlikely considering the time  frame of the entire series) she is being aided by a ghostwriter. There is  no possible way that this book could have been written by the same author  who was writing the series five years ago. Very boring and cluttered with  detail. Those of us who have come to know &quot;Qwill&quot; and his two  cats feel a great loss within the pages of this book- their personality,  humor, and warmth. To me, the &quot;clue&quot; that Braun is no longer  involved in the series was when, in THE CAT WHO ROBBED A BANK, the cats  stopped being Qwilleran's respected roomates and became instead his  demanding pets. How truly sad :(
