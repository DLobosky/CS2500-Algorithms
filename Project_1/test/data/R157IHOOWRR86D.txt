These performances from Japan, 1976, are really good. The subtitles in Japanese are imbedded in the disc in white but if needed, the other subtitles are in yellow and can be easily read.  With these compelling performances (including supporting casts) you won't notice.  I'm playing this at my next potluck opera gathering for my friends to enjoy.  Caballe and Jose are in top form.  I saw the tape of this performance once and it was so dark you couldn't enjoy it. Great to find that the company has managed to issue the high quality video and sound in this DVD.  There are few really good performances of these two stars on video and if you love them, you must have this DVD.  Great cast!
