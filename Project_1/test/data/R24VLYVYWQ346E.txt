This game is wonderful.  My children love this game and it is great for children of different ages to play.  The rules are very basic, take turns, don't tip the cactus, that's it.  My children have challanged each other to get the entire cactus put together without toppling it or putting the the smaller pieces in before the larger ones which makes balancing very difficult.  Highly recommend.  The smallest pieces would be choking hazards so not for children who still put toys in their mouth.  My nine year old still plays this game, I even enjoy this game.  This is also a game that is quickly played!
