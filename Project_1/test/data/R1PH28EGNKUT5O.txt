So far I have really enjoyed all the books in this series. As for this one (the 5th in the series) I wasn't as enthralled by it as I have been with the others. This one took me longer to finish. Of course it has a lot of action with a sniper on the loose, a house fire, and much more that I don't want to give away. So why the three stars? The main reason I love to read this series is Sookie Stackhouse herself. She is the perfect character and totally make the books what they are. She has spunk, southern hospitality, manners and a great sense of humor. I find myself laughing out loud many of times at things she would say. In this book though, I didn't find that as much. Sookie just wasn't the same. She was more pessimistic, grumpy and I did not find her funny at all. I know in this book she is going through a lot but the thing that I liked about Sookie is she never let it get her down. Still, if you liked this series I would still recommend this one. It has enough action to keep you entertained.
