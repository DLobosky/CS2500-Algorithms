It is one thing to read about the injustices of slavery from a historical or even an observer's point of view.  It is quite something else to learn of the daily life of a slave in the indentured person's own voice.  Such is the case with &quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative&quot; penned by a female slave in the 1850s.	According to the editor this manuscript has existed for 140 years, and is quite probably the &quot;earliest known novel by a female African-American slave and the earliest known novel by a black woman anywhere.&quot;  Also according to Mr. Gates a slave escaped from a North Carolina plantation in 1857 and was able to reach New Jersey.  It is his contention that she is the author of this book.	Whether one wishes to question the authenticity of his identification or not is quite immaterial considering the compelling material within &quot;The Bondwoman's Narrative.&quot;  The relationship between ladies' maids and their mistresses is revealed in sharp detail, as are the offensive overtures by a relentless master.  The slave and narrator is presented not as a human being but as chattel, valued only for what she might bring on the block.	Ms. Craft has ably evoked pictures of the old South as well as the horrific conditions imposed by bondage.  It is a miracle that these people could even hope for freedom.  It is  a wonder that this manuscript was brought to light at last.         - Gail Cooke
