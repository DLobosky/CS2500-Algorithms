Better than a mouse when used with a Wacom tablet; works with no bugs or issues; very good build quality; appears and feels reliable; comfortable to hold; and attractive appearance.Cons: Price is a bit steep.  But I double it as a mouse, so it's reasonable after all.This also works with the original Graphire tablets (CTE-xxx). I bought it to replace my less than two year old Graphire pen.  This is of much much better quality. Looks like Wacom has realized that it made a terrible pen for an otherwise excellent tablet for the Graphires. The Graphire pen was extremely unreliable and also very uncomfortable. I heard many complaints and those complaints had a reason. The Graphire pen had a terrible design, especially with the rubber covering. The buttons themselves surrounded by the rubber clothing were also poorly made. It never felt good in your hand, and it became nearly unusable after a short time. I torn away the rubber clothing and continued to use the pen for another half a year, and the thing eventually became so bad that it was completely unusable. I'm glad that Wacom made the new pens for the new Bamboo tablets compatible with the older Graphire tablets. So far, it seems 100% compatible and I've run into absolutely no issues. The new pen is better in all aspects. The buttons are much easier to access and are much better designed and made. And it lost the hated rubber cover. If you have ever used the older Graphite pen, you will especially appreciate the improvement made by this one.
