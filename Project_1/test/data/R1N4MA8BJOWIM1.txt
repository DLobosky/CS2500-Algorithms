I sit down looking forward to more of her wonderful writing and, much too soon, I have finished the book."The Heretic's Wife" continues the telling, which started in "The Illuminator" and continued with "The Mercy Seller" of a family of "heretics" who hear the newly translated words of the Bible in the manner of the Reformation and not in the centuries old version of the Roman Catholic Church.  The first book was set in the time of Wycliff and Julian of Norwich when a few people had begun writing religious tracts in English rather than Latin.  In this way, those people who could read English could access the Bible themselves instead of relying on the local priests, many of whom didn't understand the teachings of Christianity themselves.  "The Mercy Seller" took us to Prague where religious freedom was much stronger than in England.  This book takes us back to London at the time of William Tyndale and John Frith.  These two men were the ones who finally translated the Bible into English and who died for doing this.It is also the time of Henry VIII during the period when he had put aside Queen Katherine and was preparing to marry Anne Boleyn.  Because Henry was enraptured by Anne and Anne was a Protestant, many of the court officers saw this time as their last chance to stop Lutheranism (as they called it)in England, once and for all.  We see the actions which were taken by these men and, in particular, we are shown the true character of Sir Thomas More.  We learn that rather than the benign man of integrity who died for his beliefs as we saw in "A Man for All Seasons", More was an ambitious egotist and a religious bigot of the worse kind.  We also learn that his relationship with his wife and his daughter, Margaret, were not the warm fuzzy kind shown in previous writings.  Henry VIII walked a fine line during his break with the Pope and, from day to day, no one was safe.  He never intended to start a new church or break from the old one; he just wanted his own way.  This book points up the real danger that these English Protestants were in as they tried to spread the lessons of the Bible to all economic levels.I recommend this and the other two of Ms. Vantrease's books highly.  However, having finished everything she has written so far, I will be waiting anxiously for her next one.  I hope she is writing as we speak.
