I was 2-years-old when this movie was released in the theaters so I had to wait till the television & VHS versions to see and remember that which I saw as an infant. Still when I saw the original cut of this movie it was like WOW! The greatest movie ever and I was ecstatic when Lucas re-released it in the theaters. Those who complain about the re-cut of the movie were able to see this movie for the first time in the theater, those my age either do not remember or did not see it, and those younger than I were never given the chance till the re-cut. One person complained that Mos Eisley was ruined in the re-cut because this person said that Lucas changed it from "...the furthest planet from the bright center of the universe," to "all the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan." But this person fails to take in the fact that Luke was referring to Tattoine and that even on our planet we have places that are rather isolated but still have ports or airports that make a portion of it like a booming metropolis. The re-cut was necessary for us in the younger generation after being spoiled by movies like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and the "Star Trek" & "Babylon 5" TV shows & movies of the late 1980s through the 1990s. I for one am only really disappointed that Lucas decided not to include the original opening scene with Luke seeing the battle from Tattoine and then telling Biggs about it at Tosche Station (Mr. Lucas if you are reading this, this is a big hint for your next touch up). I for one loved the updated scenes and the inclusion of both the Jabba scene and the Greedo shooting first scene - and no it is not the politically correct way of changing the scene as the same critic from before has stated - for if it was a politically correct change Han would have talked Greedo out of situation and the fact that Han had carefully removed his blaster and shot so quickly after Greedo is only indicative of Han trying to beat Greedo to the trigger - in essence both versions are self defense. Nonetheless this movie is what began the Skywalker Family Saga and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.
