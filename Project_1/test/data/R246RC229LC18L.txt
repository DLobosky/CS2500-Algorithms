This is a great book for those of you who want to know how computers really work.  This book gets down to the core hardware level and intrigues you with the secrets of Computer and Electrical Engineering.  Its great for Beginners and Advanced Computer Gurus alike.  I really like this book and I would highly recommend it.  This is the kind of book universities should use in upper division hardware classes!
