This movie is a fantastic semi family-friendly film. It is packed with action and adventure which will delight the whole family. When It came out in theaters, I saw it about 3 times. Eventually, it made it's way to our local $1 admission theater, which shows only not new movies, where I saw it another 4 times! Some scenes may be a little too dark for younger children, but don't let that keep you from seeing this amazing movie. Overall, this is a great movie which is enjoyable for everyone.
