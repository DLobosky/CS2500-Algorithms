HBO in the early 2000s created a Golden Age for Television.  One of the shows in this golden age was Deadwood.  A Western based on the real town in the Dakotas is a work of      art.  Based partly on truth and mixed in with fiction, Seth Bullock comes to town to begin a business with his friend Sol Starr.  He soon finds himself up against an evil saloon proprietor named Al Swearengen.  In this season, Seth finally admits he loves Alma and discovers his wife has come to town at the same time.  He devotes himself to his wife and stepson and turns his back on Alma who is now pregnant with his child.  Al in the meantime is witnessing the changes in the camp such as the introduction of the telegraph.  Other characters are going through changes also.  Joanie Stubbs opens her own brothel and Sy Tolliver seems like a constant threat. A very good season of a great TV show.  Thank god for what HBO once was.
