I ended up giving it to a friend, who gave it to another friend, who eventually gave it to my dad, who unknowingly tried to give it back to me.  So, I've since been skeptical of such sharpening tools, and have been sharpening all my blades with stones or ceramic rod.  I don't mind "kickin' it old school," since I get great results, but it seemed like a little too much effort for my cheaper knock-around knives (which I use a lot more than my nicer blades).  Recently, I saw the Smith sharpener, the low price, and figured "why not?"  Now, I regret not getting this sooner, as it does a really decent job with most of my knives, in very little time and with minimal sweat.I use this for all of my knives, and for the nicer blades I'll finish it off with the stones.  But this is a great time saver.  The design is simple, but effective, and as long as I clean it with a little dish soap, it just keeps working.  The rubber pads on the bottom are a great idea, helping hold it in place as you run the blade over it.  I recommend this as a sharpener for casual usage, but even a perfectionist could use it as a time-saver and go use a finer method to finish off the edge the way they like it.
