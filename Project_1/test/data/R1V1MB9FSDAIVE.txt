The first thing that I noticed when I opened the package is that the mouse has the perfect size. It isn't too small like the Logitech M305 mouse or too big. I had a "compact" keyboard so I wanted a slightly smaller mouse and not a full size mouse. People who are complaining about the size didn't realize that this mouse is marketed as a "portable mouse" rather than a "full size mouse". I looked at the comparison chart on amazon and it is listed under portable mouse so I expected it to be a little smaller than a full size mouse. Even though it is slightly smaller than my older full size mouse, it feels nicer and more comfortable due to the concave buttons and rubber contour on the sides. The design is very nice, sleek and matches perfectly with my k340 with the red line on sides of the mouse. My k340 keyboard also has reddish look underneath the keys and both have glossy finish. The reddish is done slightly and nicely. And unifying receiver was very important to me in my decision. The mouse and keyboard both easily connected together to the unifying receiver. As for the mouse performance, it is a huge improvement to my wired Logitech optical mouse. I was happy with that wired mouse but then I used this and feel a huge difference. This mouse is so responsive and accurate. The "laser precision" is amazing. And I didn't want all those extra buttons so I am happy with the amount of buttons. Since I was going to use this mouse on other surfaces, I wanted to get a mouse that would work on various surfaces. While this isn't the more expensive anywhere logitech mouse, this mouse works without a mouse pad and works very nicely on my pants, couch, magazine, wood grain surfaces, etc. Some solid glossy black surfaces won't work though. I can't comment on the battery life because I haven't had it that long but if it last anywhere near to the 15 month battery life, I will be very happy. PROS: wireless, comfortable, nice looking mouse, very precise, unifying receiver, works on various surfaces, great connection to receiver, long battery life, pretty good price, 3 YEAR WARRANTYCons: If I had to be real picky..... even though I like the look of the mouse, I kind of prefer matte finish than glossy finish. However after considering that my keyboard, desktop tower and even samsung tv all have glossy finish, it is actually better that the mouse has glossy finish to match with everything else. I give the mouse a 9 out of 10.
