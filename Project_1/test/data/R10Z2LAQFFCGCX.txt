This movie is very scary and creepy. The cinematography has improved, acting; sets, props and effects are all very good for this type of movie. The producers have learned a lot and have made improvements. The sound quality it very good. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie. So without giving too much away, overall it's great and I will give it a solid (5) star! However... I still believe that Paranormal (3) is the BEST ever in all the series. They really got it right in that one. As for movie (4), I must say I was also mildly impressed. My hats off to the producers. Well done guys! Maintain the standard of movie (3), and you guys will always hit a home run every time! I highly recommend this movie, so buy on Blue Ray. Thank you.
