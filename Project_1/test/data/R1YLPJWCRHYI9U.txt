I picked up a Queen set of these sheets in Sable along with the Pinzon Damask Stripe 440-Thread-Count Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Saddle. The color was a close match to my Nautica comforter and shams. I'm not an expert in fabric or even sheets for that matter, but I do know is what comfortable feels like. Not only do they feel great, the herringbone pattern is gorgeous. The construction and stitching are also top quality. They have held up nicely after a few wash cycles. A solid buy for under-$50.
