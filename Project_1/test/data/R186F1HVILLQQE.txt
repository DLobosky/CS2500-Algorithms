

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content. I counted 9 out of screen effects, 6 that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 3 OOS effects around 20%, nothing special about them.No real complaints about the in screen 3D. Most of the footage is clear and excess parallax was only noticeable 2 times. *** Colorful, Clear in screen 3D, Great for soccer fans ****** This is NOT a movie to show off OOS effects with ***MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent) Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised. Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds
