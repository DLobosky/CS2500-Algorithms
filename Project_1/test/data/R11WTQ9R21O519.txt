Though more expensive than a similar adapter available from RadioShack, it's much better built, and has a lifetime warranty for as long as you own it.It allows the use of high-quality patch cables with devices using a 3.5mm line-in.  I mated it to Audioquest cables running into a Fiio E9 Headphone Amp.  The photo doesn't do it justice--it's a serious piece of audio equipment well worth the price.  It's not compact, though, measuring about 2.75 inches long by 1.25 inches wide by .5 inches deep, so make sure your application has room for it.And make sure the 3.5mm female jack you're plugging it into can handle the weight.  I felt the jack on the E9 was stressed too much with this adapter, and ultimately I decided to use the Monster Cable Interlink 400 MK II instead. Monster is often criticized for expensive cables that don't out-perform the competition, but I own 2 CableLinks adapters, and both are excellent pieces of equipment.  This CableLinks adapter is still a quality unit, but it's quite heavy and didn't work out in my installation.
