I have been an Andre Rieu fan but not after Dreaming. It is nothing but a collection of out takes which should have been included on his other CDs.One reason I have been a Rieu fan is that his DVDs feature lively concerts. The Dreaming DVD not only does not contain a live concert, the music is dull, poorly arranged and poorly played. And there is just too damn much of Rieu and too little of the orchestra.&quot;La vie est belle&quot; is one of Rieu's better DVDs. It was a concert in Berlin. The biggest gripe I have with Rieu's DVDs is that they contain only a part of the concerts, concerts which go on for two hours but less than an hour is on the DVD. Not in Dreaming. There are no concerts, only two 42 minute segments and no interesting extra features. The first segment contains some of the later music in the &quot;La vie est belle&quot; concert. Viewers of that DVD will remember that Rieu mentions that it might rain. Well it did rain and portions are shown in Dreaming. After watching this DVD I was so disgusted that I threw the DVD in the waste basket. Then I thought again. I pulled it out because I mmight give it to someone else. But then that would be such a dirty trick to do to anyone so I again threw it in the trash.
