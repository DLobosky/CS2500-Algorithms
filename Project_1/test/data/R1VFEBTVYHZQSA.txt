She hopes to find peace and refuge in her newly discovered birthplace, but Sitia still seems foreign and Yelena has yet to regain her memories of the home she doesn't know. She is uncomfortably unfamiliar with the customs of the various clans in Sitia, including her own, the Zaltana Clan, and even her own brother treats her like an intruder. But Yelena has little time to ponder her feelings of being an outsider or yearn for Valek, the only home she has ever known, because there is something terribly amiss in Sitia, deaths and disappearances likely to be the work of a rogue magician. Once again, Yelena finds herself a key player in a greedy ploy for power, a situation only she can remedy if she can learn to control her magical gifts.Fast paced and exciting, Magic Study is a terrific continuation of Yelena's story from the fantastic Poison Study. Snyder beautifully weaves another unforgettable tale full of secrets and intrigue that is impossible to set down; she is a storyteller so powerful that the reader is drawn into the story as if they are actually there. There are many threads to this story, but they are quite easy to keep track of. And it's not just the interesting and unique plot that captures the reader's attention, but the vivid and realistic characters. Yelena is as strong willed and independent as ever, and I admire her resourcefulness and determination to help all those who need helping; she still steal the reader's heart all over again as she confronts old demons and battles new ones. I think it's very interesting how there's not any real set of defined rules of right and wrong and how these gray areas and various interpretations are so integral to the story. Loyalty as well is a large influence from Yelena's Ixian friends to surprising past relationships. I feel a sort of greater theme is at work developing here besides Yelena's trilling tale, and I'm excited to see how it plays out in the conclusion to this trilogy, Fire Study.Fans of Poison Study will certainly not be disappointed in the unpredictable and satisfying story in Magic Study. Readers who enjoy this trilogy will also like The Abhorsen Chronicles by Garth Nix, Princess Ben by Catherine Gilbert Murdock, and the Mortal Instruments trilogy by Cassandra Clare.
