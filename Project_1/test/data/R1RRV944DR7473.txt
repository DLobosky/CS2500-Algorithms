Red Rubber Ball has some great tracks, including one of my favourite  Cyrkle recordings: We Had A Good Thing Goin'. This was an interesting, and  for the time, innovative treatment of Neil Sedaka's song. But I am so  disappointed my all-time favourite Cyrkle song [the flipside of We Had A  Good Thing Goin'] was not included. Two Rooms, which was on the  now-unavailable Neon album, is a song of only 1'20&quot; but it is so sweet  and so sad, that I am sorry it was not made available.If you like the  music of Lovin' Spoonful, I think you'll love some of these tracks, but  there are also quite a few duds.
