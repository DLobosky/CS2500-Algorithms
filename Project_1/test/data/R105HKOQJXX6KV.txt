Well, the only flaw was that the movie had to end, but this is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest movies( but he never makes a bad one!). I have the R2(Japanese) version with subs, 2.0 DD, and about 83% progressive, but this version will have DD 5.1 Japanese and English, and be 100% progressive! It will also have a redone soundtrack by it's original composer Joe Hisaishi(which translates to Quincy Jones in American, who is also a great composer!), redone dub with Anna Paquin, James Van Derbeek, and other Hollywood celebs, it will come with a second disc(no there isn't a box or special edition, so preorder now!) that will have storyboard to movie comparison, trailers, and some more stuff! The only thing bad is that Disney will probably put their own movie trailers on the second disc.  Now that that's out the way, for my review: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE 80's, NO MAKE THAT OF ALL TIME!! It starts out with a bang, Mama and her gang overrun a blimp for a necklace that can make things levitate that a little girl named Sheeta has been kidnapped for. They bust into a room and the girl climbs out the window to get away but falls into the sky and falls. We see Laputa engraved on a stone and then see probably the greatest intro to any movie...EVER!! It shows the story of flying castles and what became of this. A young boy spots Sheeta falling and catches her just in time. Thus, the beginning to a great story with amazing visuals, interesting characters, funny scenes, and great character development. This movie or any Ghibli movie will turn non-believers into frothing at the mouth anime fans like you and me! P>Well that's about all the time I have! Be sure to buy this piece of animated history, something Disney could never make!!
