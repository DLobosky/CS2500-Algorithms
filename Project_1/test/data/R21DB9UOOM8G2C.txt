If you're a Rockford fan, you will buy this set, no questions asked, and you probably don't need reviewers to tell you about it. There's no question about the appeal of this ageless, long-running series. But arguably even more important than the quality of the show is the quality of the DVDs. The Season Three release, like Season Two, contains single-sided disks--the dreaded Universal double-sided disks are gone, and with them, hopefully, the freezing and skipping problems that so many people reported with the Season One set. Here's hoping Universal has learned a lesson from the shoddy Rockford Season One and "Kolchak: The Night Stalker" releases and will give us nothing but high-quality, reliable DVDs in the future.
