THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD Blu-ray ReviewDistributor: MGM Video (US)"How do you kill something that's already dead?"For some time now, The Return of the Living Dead has been on Obscura's most wanted Blu-ray list. On first hearing of this release some months ago, we were very keen to see if the wait would ultimately prove worth while. Thankfully and just for the print quality alone, it was.Having seen the film across countless video releases and DVD releases over the years, finally seeing the HD print proved to be a real treat. The film is presented with a strong 1080p 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, which looks excellent considering the original low budgets of the movie itself. Colours are a real eye opener and look vibrant throughout, black levels appear strong and there is a definite increase on the available detail here. The transfer quality, really is a lot better than expected.Audio is presented in DTS HD and dialogue is both clear and effective. Running through the whole film, the classic punk rock anthems are given a real boost. One point worth noting however is that the soundtrack on this Blu-ray is the same as the previous DVD release which has received some audio substitutions. These include a change to the pitch on Tarman's famous "brains" quotes and some lessening of the background music during certain scenes. Apparently these changes were director approved and although the Tarman of the 80's sounded funnier and yet more creepy than his new deeper voice suggests, this isn't enough to ruin an otherwise excellent presentation.The extras offered on this release are ported over from the recent special edition DVD including a cast commentary track, a director commentary, a modern day making of documentary and a reasonably in depth feature about 1980's horror movies.The only real negative in this release, is that yet again, the many deleted scenes and extensive workprint footage is nowhere to be seen. Any long term fan of the film will be aware that much alternate footage exists, including a very different ending. Instead of including a pretty much otherwise useless DVD disc with this package, it would have been preferable to have included a workprint version or at the very least, some deleted scenes on the second disc.Still, all things considered, The Return of the Living Dead makes an impressive d&eacute;but on Blu-ray, the print quality here really makes a big difference over previous releases and it's safe to say that this is probably the best this film will ever look. For fans of classic 1980's zombie/horror movies, this is a must have title, and for everyone else, you could actually do a lot worse than adding this one to your collection. Be advised though, if the curse of region coding still affects your purchasing decisions, this release is locked to A.The original fast running, brain munching, paramedic and cop calling living dead, have never appeared as intense.Oh and "watch your tongue, boy, if you like this job!"BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of those less mainstream releases find us on Facebook
