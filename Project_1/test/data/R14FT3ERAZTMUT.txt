What help this pay per view out the most of course, was the main event.World Tag Team TitlesWilliam Regal and Eugene vs. Christian and Tyson TomkoI'm not going to lie this was a pretty good opener. Nice tag team action to start off the show. It's messed up though, that Eugene injured himself in this match. Thank god, they got the match over with, even with his injury. Regal and Eugene keep the titles. And this was the first of two injuries of the night. Rating: ***Women's ChampionshipLita vs. Trish StratusIt's a shame the match ended the way it did. Lita had got the title three weeks ago before this match and she loses it!!!!  We have another injury for the night. Plus, with Lita gone it just hurts the women's division EVEN MORE. This match went on for 4 or 5 minutes at least because of the injury. Trish gets the win making her 5 time women's champion. Rating: *Muhammad Hassan vs. Jerry ''The King'' LawlerNot a very good match period, but I have seen worst. It was funny how Hassan's manager (Daivari) got chased by J.R though. Hassan hits his finisher (don't even know the name of it yet) on Lawler to get the win. Rating: **Intercontinental ChampionshipShelton Benjamin vs. MavenWow, I guess the Maven push ends here. This match was VERY QUICK. Maven does some nice mike work, says he's leaving runs back in the ring before he gets counted out and Shelton rolls him up for the win??!! Maven then does some more mike work and tells Benjamin to get back in the ring, looks like we have a second match of this. Benjamin comes back in the ring hits the T-bone suplex and gets another win!!!!! Shameful how WWE didn't give these guys more time than this. Rating: * 1/2Kane vs. Gene SnistkyI pretty much liked all of the matches these two been in. This one was okay, didn't like it as much as their match at Taboo Tuesday. But it was still a nice match. I loved the ending when Kane does the tombstone to Snistky. Rating *** 1/2Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight ChampionshipRandy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Triple H, Guess Referee: Shawn MichaelsAwesome match!!!!  I think many will agree with me that this is the second best elimination chamber ever. The Summerslam 2003 one wasn't all that good. Many great moments in this match, the one that I will remember the most is Benoit's diving headbutt off top of one of the chambers. J.R's reaction to that on commentary (after Benoit did it) while very funny was right on the button. Batista was VERY over with the crowd in this match. They even boo'ed when Orton elimatied him from the match. Triple H gets the win after a little help from Batista to beat Orton and become a ten time world heavyweight champion. Rating: *****Like I said before the main event saved the pay per view.  The DVD has more extras but not many. It has three promos (commericals) of the New Year's Revolutionn matches. And it has all the interviews of each wrestler that was in the chamber match. If you think about buying the DVD, buy it for this match only. But then again, I won't blame you if you rent it.
