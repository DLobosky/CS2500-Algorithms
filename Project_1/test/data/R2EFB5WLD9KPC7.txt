Some of the other reviewers remarks about the outline of the design and the fill-in of the color is a bit off on some of the plates is true.  I deducted a full star because this lack of tight registration in the application of the print is well pronounced on some of the dinner plates - I bought 2 sets and it happened in both. I wish that the facility and the company that makes these now cared more about that particular imperfection and would make an effort to do better. I would pay a little more if they would fix that and make glass mugs here instead of stoneware mugs sourced from China or Thailand. At least that would alleviate the concern about lead or other heavy metals. Nothing was broken upon arrival.  Even though I gave them 3 stars I still kept the sets.  As noted in the title of this review, the pros and cons were ones I was fine with.
