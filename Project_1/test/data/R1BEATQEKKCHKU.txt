At one point he admits that he tries to keep himself in SOME kind of shape for romance reasons: "If it weren't for women, I'd be fatter than David Crosby!"I bring this up because women make men do things they wouldn't ordinarily do - some good... some bad.What if you had a group of men - four best friends from Queens ten years out of high school?  What if ONE of them became a big movie star, hired the other buddies as "assistants", moved to Hollywood, and generally got every wish of every teen-aged boy?Psychology students learn that the id is the part of the human personality that indulges every selfish desire: the characters of "Entourage" are almost all id.  (The show is most interesting when the characters are able to suppress their "manliness" long enough to show the more desirable human qualities: compassion, kindness, etc.)  Entourage follows the professional and love lives of four friends from New York.The group's world swirls around Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), an up and coming 30-ish movie star from Queens.  Vince is the kind of actor who is competing for roles with Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Vince's older brother is Johnny "Drama" Chase (Kevin Dillon).  In a genius piece of casting Dillon, the not quite as accomplished and good-looking brother of Matt Dillon, plays the not as accomplished and not as good-looking brother of Vince.  While Vince walks through a world where he is always the center, with beautiful women and agents and producers constantly vying for his attention, "Drama" was once the star of "Viking Quest" two decades ago, and today struggles with attempts to keep his self-esteem afloat in the shadow of his mega-star brother.  Jerry Ferrara plays "Turtle", the least talented and only dumpy member of the group.  Turtle knows well that he owes everything to the fame of Vince.  He's happy to lead a love-life that consists of girls drawn to the aura that surrounds Vince who are not chosen by the man himself.  Kevin Connolly plays Eric "E" Murphy, Vince's best friend.  "E" is the character most rooted in the real world, the one most viewers would identify with.  Vince trusts "E" enough to make him his manager, and one of the best continuing storylines of the show involves "E" growing from a New York Pizza manager to Hollywood power player.Jeremy Piven plays Ari Gold, Vince's agent.  Piven has won several awards as the over-the-top Ari - intense and arrogant and vulgar, but again, some of the best moments of the show come when Ari shows the slightest hint of humanity. Entourage is a behind-the-scenes show, and succeeds in an extremely entertaining way, in the same way that "The West Wing" showed us a glimpse behind the curtain at the White House and "Bull Durham" gave us an idea of what happens in those pitcher's mound pow-wows that sports fans get to see, but never hear.Not quite grown up - and with little incentive to do so - the boys live lives that bounce between parties and restaurants, always surrounded by beautiful women, and usually looking for Vince's next project.What would YOU do if your best friend became the next ten million per movie star and invited you and your other buds from the old `hood to hang out in Hollywood?This show gives us a delicious "what if".
