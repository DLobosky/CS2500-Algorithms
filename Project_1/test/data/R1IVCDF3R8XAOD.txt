Other reviewers have given wonderful reviews of the actual facts presented by Taubes and I certainly won't repeat them all here. The basic premise, as mentioned many times, is that the "low fat" dogma proposed as the healthiest way of eating for many years now, is predicated on totally flawed and biased data pushed hard by a strong-willed personality, and that it is sugars and refined carbs that are the more likely villains in the onward march of the "diseases of civilization".But the Taubes book does not tell you *what* to eat, or how to prepare it. It's not a diet. But after reading it I have read many other amazon reviews and recommendations for books that could help support me in my quest to healthier eating, which eventually led me to "Nourishing Traditions" - the best cookbook ever written, and the second most life-changing book I have ever read. I don't agree with Fallon on many points - far too much sugar (in various disguises) and white flour allowed in various recipes, and I don't feel that chocolate (dark bittersweet or unsweetened), caffeine or wine are inherently evil. But she made me look at *all* food with a new eye. These days I'm preparing everything from scratch. I can't even buy bottled salad dressing and condiments anymore after reading the labels. I'm buying organic and antibiotic and hormone free foods whenever I can manage to do so. I just made my own first batch of whey this past weekend. :-) So bless Gary Taubes for the wonderful research on the WHY of why I should eat the way I do, and bless Sally Fallon for the HOW. This may not be the only cookbook I'll ever need again, but I bet you anything it will be the most consulted one ever. I've even been bringing back and forth on my daily commute, to read as my "bus" book, just as I would normally read a novel. The wonderful sidebar quotes are just as good as the recipes, and totally make the book.And the little "Know your Ingredients" quizzes with their long lists of mystery ingredients? Wow, have they had an impact on me too. I've always said I had no time to cook, but I'm sure making the time now after reading this book.
