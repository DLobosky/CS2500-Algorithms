In fact the addition of the Vampire Killers that end up on Betsy's side just made it so much fun.  The addition of Betsy getting a job at Macy's for the shoes, made me giggle. The little girl ghost was a nice addition and let Betsy grow up a little.  I loved the Sinclair and Betsy moments---especially towards the end of the book. Tina was fantastic again.What I liked: The story itself was fun, light, and easy to read. I love how MJD combines stuff we deal with in real life with life as a Vampire Queen. Audible Review:  I listened to this on audio book and the narrator was fantastic.  She nailed Betsy and Tina to a tee. I can't wait to listen to the rest of them :)Why it got a 4: This book was a fun, light read that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys PNR.  It will make you laugh and sometimes even shake your head.  Betsy and crew will delight you!Who I would recommend it to:  PNR readers that like a fun, light read that makes you giggle outloud![...]
