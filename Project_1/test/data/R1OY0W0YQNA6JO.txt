Far different. Princeton, likewise, has changed, but is closer to the original. Probably, being the county seat, and situation closer to I-77, has improved its lot.This wonderful work goes back to way before I was born; still, many of the people and places touch my own memory. I even found my Dad, correctly identified, in the midst of a group standing on the steps of the old Bland Street Methodist Church in 1926. Dr. John Nash, is, naturally, represented. [Him, I have never met]. So is basketball legend Rod Thorn, whom I knew very well from the Elks Country Club. He can hit it a mile.....The book, stories, and photo reproductions are of first rate quality, and Bill gives due credit to the late Eddie Steele for much of the foundation. Talk about a local legend!! This is a real journey in a time machine. If you happen to buy your copy there, take it to the "Daily Telegraph" office on Bluefield Ave., and Bill will sign it for you. He is a grand gentleman, and a treasure house of local legend.
