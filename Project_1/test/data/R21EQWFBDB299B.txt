It's essentially a bigger and better collection of Farscape Episodes. Instead of getting four episodes you get seven. Intead of paying $35 retail you pay $20. You get all the cool extras that are on this collection along with even more cool extras. Look for the Starburst Edition for season four. If it's anything like the previous seasons they will release three volumes (as opposed to the five with this collection). See? Another added bonus... more shelf space.
