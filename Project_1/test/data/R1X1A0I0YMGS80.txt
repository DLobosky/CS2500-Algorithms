After I got these I wish I had not waited so long to buy them. These are very thick and durable. They also fit really nice and have not moved a bit. I find it really nice how well it holds liquids/kids snacks in its channels. These are really going to save my carpet. I am going to leave the same review on the Third row floor mats also. These are truly must haves. I would like to also note that they fit like a glove. It does require you to trim just a bit but if you lay them both out in the car before you cut you can make sure it will end up perfect. I myself ended up having them backwards and glad I realized it before I trimmed.
