First, &quot;Un Chien Andalou,&quot; which is a  hypnotic, visceral and a masterpiece of surrealism by one of the masters,  Luis Bunuel. &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; embodies the words that display  Bunuel's work: Beautiful, dark, graphic, shocking and brilliant. The  opening shot, one of the greatest and most memorable is a stroke of  shocking genius. Some have attacked &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; because it  literally makes no sense, even Bunuel gave credit to that. But it's not  supposed to. &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; is instead meant to be some sort  of dream experience, a nightmare or collection of dream sequences put on  film. And the result is brilliant because here Bunuel displays that dreams  truly can make it into cinema, no matter how shocking or disturbing. The  second brilliant work here, &quot;Land Without Bread&quot; is absolutely  eye-opening and is always involving and interesting. Bunuel brilliantly  takes us through the hell that is Las Hurdes and the surrounding lands.  Among the great, graphic images brilliantly documented here are the one  showing a wedding custom which involves riders tearing the head off a  rooster hanging from a rope across a street, the one of a goat violently  falling down a hill and one showing a donkey killed by bees, then eaten by  wild dogs. &quot;Land Without Bread&quot; is hard-hitting, as it should be.  Bunuel brilliantly captures the atmosphere of this land and it's primitive  people. The scenery is artistic in it's own fashion, no matter how poor or  medieval. Both these films are masterworks by a genius who has left his  mark on the cinema for all time. To understand the work of Luis Bunuel, you  must see &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; and &quot;Land Without Bread.&quot;
