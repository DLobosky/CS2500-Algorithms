I was planning to start gardening more this coming year and this is indispensable with great gardening tips, like planting dates, etc. Make sure you check out the Farmer's Almanac company website, because they will let you download a free gardener's guide.This is one of those great American publications that has stood the test of time; it's like buying a little piece of history. And how else can you get great reading entertainment for an entire year for less than $10? Conclusion: Recommended, of course!
