As a designer who deals with a lot of print based production, I go through a TON of xacto knives. #11 blades are your best friend as a designer.On the regular #11 blades, I'd use them for a while before they'd go dull, and they lasted for a few days each. Usually it would all go downhill after the very tip of the blade would break off. $3-4 per pack of blades really add up over time if you calculate the costs.I read online xacto themselves were giving out free Z series blades for anyone to try, and I got my hands on one a few days ago. I've been using it now, cutting 80lb cover stock, and 30lb text weight paper, and so far the tip hasnt broken off yet, while the old #11 blades would have by now with the same amount of usage.The nice gold accents from the blade and knife themselves are nice. I had a few people ask me "Where did you get that cool gold xacto knife?"My only complaint is the fact that the handle is still the same old xacto handle that's been in use for YEARS. The only thing they changed was adding the gold accent to the handle. I also have a more modern handle which is coated with rubber and more ergonomic, much more comfortable and easy to use when cutting. After using my new Z series knife and handle for a few days, I've finally decided that I'd just toss the blade itself onto my ergonomic xacto handle for a better grip and feel. In the end, it's a xacto knife, we've had them for years. They've improved upon the design and quality of metal to make it better, so from now on I'll be using the Z series blades when I cut things by hand and design.I highly recommend these blades to anyone who's a designer, student, or just into crafts and uses an xacto knife frequently.
