The ebook shows you the best sights of the city, what's worth your time and what may not be right for you. It helps you to get to know the city before you even get off the plane. Important info: if you want to stay anywhere within a two mile walking distance of the White House, Capitol Building, or Mall your going to have to pay for it especially during the cherry blossom season. The street by street maps is very useful. I think this ebook is a big improvement over those "traditional" travel guides and I heartily rate "Mobilereference Guide to Washington, DC" as a "buy". Works great on iPhone!
