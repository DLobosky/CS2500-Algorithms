But she certainly has the Irish spirit inside her based on this CD.The whopping 19 tracks (many are medleys) combine traditional Irish dance tunes (jigs, reels, straphspeys) with some new melodies that she composed for her and her band (the standard accordion, bodhron guitar and percussion section - with a harp thrown in on a few tracks). There's a bit of varied instrumentation when there is some rain added on one track and a harp shows up on a couple of others.The fiddler composed five of the songs and gives them contemporary names - "Jury Duty Waltz" was written while she was waiting to be called during that inevitable jury duty - but the music is no different that if it was composed in the Emerald Isle. But there's nothing wrong with that. She's a more than capable player and I did have the chance to see her play live - which I would recommend. This is not "Riverdance" music that is fast and furious. Finlayson plays the softer and more formal Irish dance music.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
