My 5-year old son loved this project, but yes (per the prior reviewers note) it is a craft project, not an electronic robot. It will roll if you push it, but is more of a display item. I thought that was clear  by the description though, so I wasn't expecting anything else. As a craft project it is a really fun one for young boys, as it also involves some plastic bolts and assembly, in addition to coloring and stickers. So it is kind of a combination beginning model/craft. Definitely meant for young boys, I would say preschoolers could handle it with parental help, and 5 - 7 can do it by themselves.
