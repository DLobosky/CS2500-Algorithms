His writing and thinking are clear and concise, and he doesn't let his religion get in the way of his spirituality. Whatever your concept of the Great Spirit, God, etc, it's easy to find wisdom here. A gentle, truly humble soul, Merton is his own best testimony to the benefits of shutting out the world and letting your inner voice have its say. This is maybe the most accessible of Merton's writings, and if the far-right wackos who currently control America would open their minds to these concepts, we'd all be living in a much more peaceful and loving world. Killing people to pave the way for God's love; it's an old concept but it's still going strong. Truly religious men like Merton make clear what true Christianity is: loving ALL thy neighbors.
