However the author's Asperger's syndrome was not diagnosed (if it ever was) until one of her own children received this diagnosis.What shall I say? The author is exceedingly articulate and expresses in detail whatever she wants to say. The book was a bit too intense for me (who apparently have many of the symptoms of AS as do practically all of the reviewers on this site.) She tells us about the problems she had in her childhood and later in life. She is apparently extremely extrovert and has difficulty in refraining from immediately blurting out her opinions, and indeed enjoys talking in front of a group. Though I have seen elsewhere that some AS sufferers have the opposite problem and talk very little. She doesn't mention this fact however, and I feel that one of the minuses of the book is that it is so subjective.We are led to understand from the book that AS sufferers have difficulty in creating and keeping friends, and on the whole in cooperating with others. They generally do not feel a need to create strong relationships with others. They have difficulty with social relations as a whole, in knowing the "right" things to do and say. Loud noises and sharp lights are found disturbing, this leading to a lack of desire to frequent public places or attend parties or events attracting a large number of people.What I found remarkable was that the author did manage to create and retain some few good friends, who have been of indispensable help to her. I feel that she has been extremely blessed in this respect, taking her "handicap" into consideration. She has also found an understanding, compatible partner and given birth to three children.She had difficulty in orienting herself, for example, finding her way about the university she attended or maneuvering shopping malls. She likes rules and like me, especially when I was younger, has difficulty in understanding or accepting that when people say they will do certain things in a certain time frame they don't do them.This book has been an eye-opener for me, in that it has helped me to recognize my own Asperger characteristics and to show me that I am not alone with all this. I now better understand the perfectionistic side to my nature and why I hate spelling mistakes and the like. I also better understand my need to read everything in a book, preferably skipping nothing, though I did manage to skip a few of the appendices in this book which I didn't feel were relevant to me.Some qualities of "Aspies" are that they are honest, direct ("say it like it is") and loyal friends if their friends can accept the fact that they are different and "hold out". "Aspies" don't necessarily lack empathy, I certainly don't, and they/we can be extremely helpful by nature.I would diagnose Detective Monk in the popular TV-series as being an extreme example of an "Aspie" (though his OCD symptoms are those most generally recognizable). He often has difficulty in being empathic or recognizing the needs of others, but in the end he helps them anyway, even at the risk of his life. Of course he is a fictional character, but must have been modelled on some real-life person.To sum up, this book is extremely useful for those of us who ourselves have AS characteristics, and for those who need help to understand us. Though it must be pointed out that all the characteristics of the author are not shared by all other "Aspies".
