I picked this book out of my constantly growing to-be-read stack without checking where it falls within the series.  As soon as I began to read I had to go look it up because I discovered that Inspector Rutledge is recuperating from a gunshot wound.  Not a very usual circumstance to find when reading period English mysteries.  This is the fifth book in the series so now, of course, I must read the fourth, Legacy of the Dead (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries), to find out what happened in Scotland and how Rutledge got shot.  In this story Chief Superintendent Bowles sends Rutledge off to a small town called Osterley in Norfolk to make an appearance from Scotland Yard to show their support of the local police.  A Catholic priest has been killed and all Rutledge has to do is make an appearance, assure the townsfolk by his presence that their local man has everything well in hand, and then return to London.  He's not to get himself involved in the case.  So, of course, he immediately does become involved.I am a faithful fan of the writings of Charles Todd, both for the Inspector Rutledge and the Bess Crawford series.  This book was another superb example of the deft hand this mother/son team has with descriptions of landscapes and weather conditions.  Their characters are so deeply etched that you will remember even the barmaid and how many children she has.  The plotting is intricate with multiple problems and solutions presented so as a reader I'm always kept guessing what the final outcome will be.  This story contained layer upon layer of interactions between the residents of this small town both in the past and present.  I liked how no one person had all the parts of the puzzle in their grasp, but had to share their portion to make the whole.Corporal Hamish MacLeod is a presence inside Rutledge's mind.  Rutledge hears Hamish talking to him and he answers him.  If this is your first time to consider reading a novel in this series, please don't be put off by thinking you will not like this aspect of the book.  Rutledge had horrendous experiences in World War I and he still suffers with the mental anguish of trying to understand why he survived and so many he ordered to fight did not.  Hamish was one of the casualties of war, except he was not killed by a German bullet but by an action taken by Rutledge.  While working through all of these problems with depression and having Hamish as a constant companion the authors are always able to bring the truth about the conditions of that war vividly into their novels.  People were changed forever, Rutledge and Hamish are two of those people with stories to tell.I highly recommend any of the novels in this series.  The authors always do a very good job of bringing any new readers quickly into the picture of the time period and the problems facing Rutledge both from a psychological standpoint and from his career in Scotland Yard.  Hamish plays a large part in this specific book, more so than in some of the more recently published novels.  My only  question is:  when does Rutledge ever buy gas (petrol) for his car?  If I could just see that action once, I could stop watching for it to happen!
