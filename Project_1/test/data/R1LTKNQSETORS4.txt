Bedazzled gives the Devil a totally new look! Liz Hurley plays a goodlooking yet cheeky Devil who has granted the character of Elliot (Brandon Fraser) 7 wishes. Elliot, a lone work-aholic, is madly in love with a woman, Alision, and is willing to sell his soul to the Devil for these 7 wishes.If you're looking for a movie with funny and unexpected twists, this is it. Because every wish puts Elliot in a different place, as a different character. While the Devil has decided to have some fun with him, and so he goes from being a drug lord, to an NBA player to an emotionally sensitive guy.Altogether, a brilliant movie, with Fraser really being a different person in every one of his wishes, and Hurley being a sneaky devil.
