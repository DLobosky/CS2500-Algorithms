This is quite a different album from Insurgentes. Go in with the expectation that you will not get something as loud or relentless as that album. If you are familiar with Steven Wilson's work, you will hear bits and pieces of past things mixed here and there, but the overall effort is a step beyond what has come before.To me, this wasn't an easy album to like at first. I am not a natural fan of the type of jazz blended in on the album, and everything seemed a bit random and without focus. But once I forced myself to be educated by it over the space of about a week and it eventually "clicked", I am hearing all kinds of things I never even knew where there on my first listens. It's well worth the effort to invest some time in this if it doesn't strike you as much to get worked up over at first.Even after you reach that stage, you can discover even more by listening to it on a good sound system, where all kinds of textures and hidden sounds reveal themselves. The snare drum will connect with your ear drums, and the album as a whole preserves a good amount of dynamic range and makes good use of it. You will miss half the album by listening to it on your earbuds.If I had rated this on first listen, I would have given it a 3/5. One week later, I rate it as one of the best albums I've ever heard (though I am not that familiar with his stated influences for this album), and a step above Insurgentes which was excellent in itself.One final comment... I can't believe some people are suggesting that he could have left "Raider II" off the album and put the album on one CD instead of two. "Raider II" seems to me to be the centerpiece and a culmination of everything that goes on on the album and it's hard to imagine the album without it. Likewise, I don't understand the suggestions that it could be edited down to half the length. It is a 23-minute track that uses the advantage of length to add elements that would overstay their welcome on a shorter track. I agree that not much would be lost if maybe the last 2 minutes of the track were left off (the last 2 minutes are a Bass Communion-esque ending after what seems like the real ending), but halving it in length doesn't seem justifiable to me.Excellent album, overall. I'm pretty sure I won't be hearing anything else as good as this this year. And get both the CD and the Blu-Ray because the CD is a derivative of the full surround mix on the Blu-Ray! The album is so good and the price of each is so affordable that this in no way feels like a rip-off or double-dipping.
