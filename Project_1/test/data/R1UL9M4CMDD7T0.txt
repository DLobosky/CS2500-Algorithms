The entire book is a listing, in alphabetical order, of types of uses of language traditionally called "rhetorical devices," many under their Latin names.  The explanations given for each are not particularly well-written or clear, and many of the examples used are obtuse.  At the end of every alphabetical listing there is a not very helpful sentence or two of how you might use each device.  It is unclear why having the Latin name in your head of a fallacious argument that most people would recognize immediately as fallacious is a way to "win every argument."  The author's explanation is that if you are able to put a Latin name to something your opponent is arguing, you will make it sound like s/he is "suffering from a rare tropical disease."  Why the author thinks this is a positive thing is not entirely clear to me.  He further states that throwing Latin around will make you seem "erudite and authoritative."  I don't know what circles the author travels in, but in America at least, this type of behavior is more likely to make you sound pompous and condescending.
