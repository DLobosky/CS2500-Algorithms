I tought rey and eddie made a really good tag team and there styles worked together great in the ring. I also thought the bashams put alot into this match. Nice way to end it with some lieing cheating and steeling. Good match. Winners and new tag team champs rey and eddie. Match Rating 8/10.2. Booker T vs. Heidenrich- i did not enjoy this match that much. First off i dont think people like heidenrich sould be even close to get in the ring with booker t. Another thing is it seemed slow and that it dragged on and you know you have a problem when the crowd is not involved. The worst part is the match ended by dq. Winner by dq booker t. Match Rating 4/10.3. Akio vs. Spike dudley vs. Paul London vs. Funaki vs. Chavo vs. shannon moore- I liked this match. i wished they would have not made the eleminations so quick but this was kept at a good pace. I thought everyone put a good effort in and i think the cruiserwieght division is important to smackdown. Good match. Winner and new cruiserwieght champ chavo. Match Rating 7.5/10.4. Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns- I thought this was an okay match. I thought the pace was kind of slow but it was not to bad. I give alot of credit to luther for working hard with an appontent like taker and i think taker did alot of work as well. Nothing real great but a soild match between these two. Winner the Undertaker. Match Rating 7/10.5. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle #1 contender for the wwe title- Match of the night by far. I remember there match in 2003 which was decent but this one was so much better. I think alot of the crowd was behind cena but it was good to hear kurt get some chants as well sience we were in his hometown. There was back and forth action and the last 6 minutes was awsome. You will injoy this match alot trust me. Winner John Cena. Match Rating 10/10.6. Jbl vs. Big Show in a barbwire steel cage match for the wwe title- I thought this was good for a first attempt at this. I liked the match itself but i did not see why the crowd was not into this. Good match i thought and i think there was real barbwire. Some nice near falls and a nice ending to the match were jbl gets chockslamed off the top rope and he goes through the ring. Winner and still wwe champ Jbl. Match Rating 8.5/10.Well thats raps up another. I would give no way out a grade of 45/60 which is a 75% which means this was an awsome ppv. Almost perfect but i think the booker match held that back. Still A good ppv i would recomend it. I would appericate if you would tell me if my review was helpful or not.
