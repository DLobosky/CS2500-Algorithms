If you are just starting to buy DVD's or haven't bought any of the James Bond series, this is the set to start with because they are all GREAT! Since the first time this set was offered, they've ditched the weak "Moonraker" and the one-shot Lazenby "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," (a good hard-nosed Bond flick), and added "Goldfinger," "Licence to Kill," "GoldenEye," and "Tomorrow Never Dies." These coupled with the carry-over movies "Dr. No, "Man with the Golden Gun," and "The Spy Who Loved Me" make this the best of the Bond collections. With the two best Connery movies, "Dr. No" and "Goldfinger," the two best Moore movies, "The Man with the Golden Gun" and "The Spy who Loved Me," the best Dalton movie, "License to Kill," and the two best Brosnan movies(until "Die Another Day" came out) "GoldenEye" and "Tomorrow Never Dies," all at an average price lower than your local superstore could sell them at, this is one of the best bargains you'll find on Amazon.com. Each movie comes packed with audio commentary by directors and others, special "making of" type features, and other features, that will enhance anyone's DVD collection.Some have said that they had problems with some of the discs.  I didn't, and hopefully, the problem has been resolved.
