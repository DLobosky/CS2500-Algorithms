Ignore those who wrote "I read the warnings but bought it anyway" and then complained.  These people have no clue.This cable does NOT convert any signal.  It is used in situations where the devices are expecting a certain signal.  It is not misleading, and there really isn't a need for a manual because it doesn't do anything requiring installation.  Does any other cable come with a manual or instructions?  "Plug it in."  Case 1: your computer video card can be CONFIGURED to output Component video (various HD resolutions or SD 480p).  This is configured in the control panel/pane.  Some ATI products had this ability, others required a dongle with dip switches that told the card which signal to send over component (720p, 1080i, etc.).  If your card was software configurable, it will tell the video card to do the conversion and send Component video over the proper pins on the VGA connector.  A television or projector would then see this as an HD signal and display it.  There is also a shareware utility that can hack into some cards to tell them to send the signal out correctly.Case 2: your monitor or projector can receive component signals over the VGA input port.  Again, certain monitors and projectors can do this.  It's more common on projectors, but my 42" Panasonic Plasma MONITOR (not TV, MONITOR) can do this.  Again, you need to go into the menu of the receiving unit and tell it to look for component signal over the particular input.Case 3: very rare, but there are a few older projectors and monitors with 3 connector RGB inputs (also known as SYNC on Green).  But again, your output device must be able to send sync on green over VGA.  This was more common 10-15 years ago.If you don't have these setups, this cable is not for you.  If you rate it 1 star because it doesn't work for you and you don't have one of these setups, you need to look up the meaning of caveat emptor.  Or simply investigate before you buy a product.
