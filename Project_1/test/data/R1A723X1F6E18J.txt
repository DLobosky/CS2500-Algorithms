Ably translated by Margarita Ponomaryova and Kim Green, Yegorova's memoir gives a human scale view of pre-war purges, of socialist construction projects, of soldiers' lives during the war, of what it meant to be a female combat pilot, of what repatriated prisoners went through on returning to Russia - in short, a tale of a heroic life through the middle of the last century. As Yegorova concludes her story: "The war showed the whole world who these `women in Russian villages' are and how their hearts can soar in the name of their motherland."
