I have a Roku XD/S.  For months I tried to get it to work properly.  It would stop soon after an HD movie started, reload and the it would show the movie in reduced quality SD.  I don't know how many times I called Roku, netflix, motorola (my router) and my internet provider.  I even stopped using the wireless and connected the Roku directly to the router with an eithernet cable.  None of this worked.  I gave up and bought an Apple TV.  It is about the same price, much, much smaller, has more features and works great.  It is at least ten times better than the Roku.
