I watched the Barber of Seville at the Met in NY in the early '90s and I thought it was a marvelous performance, giving justice to Rossini's intentions.This production is far from the one I watched even if this one had the benefit of subtitles.Too much movement onstage as one other reviewer put it. Very distracting, but I guess the director simply did not want to lose any of your attention. Talk about &quot;undivided&quot;!  I took me forever to finish watching it, pausing each time to relieve myself of the distractions. The cast was great though, especially the Count.
