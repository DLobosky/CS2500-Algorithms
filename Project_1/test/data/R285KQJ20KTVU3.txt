Comparable in scope, clarity, completeness, and accuracy to any of the very expensive general genetics texts currently available.  And with this one there's nothing else to buy...no study guides, solution manuals, cd's or supplemental websites are required.  The book stands alone, and does so for less than half the price of the solution manual for most texts.    Particularly strong is the coverage of classical genetics, which can often be more difficult to grasp than the more modern "molecular" concepts of the science.  Highly recommended for self-study, as a reference, or as a supplement to any genetics textbook.
