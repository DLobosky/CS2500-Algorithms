This book details the aircraft carried aircraft carriers.   Each ship has a detailed history along with the listing of what aircraft were carried and when.  Information about aircraft color schemes is minimal and I found this to be a drawback.  For this reason I limited the stars to four.  Others may not agree with this ranking.  This is a valuable reference for anyone with an interest in the IJN and its ships and aircraft.
