I have an original Kindle, a Fire, and now a Paperwhite.  Each has its own benefits:The Fire is like an IPAD, is color, but is a bit heavier and bulkier than the Paperwhite or basic Kindle. I do miss the color at times with the Paperwhite and read graphic novels and kids books with the Fire.  Due to the way it lights up the megapixels, it is like reading from a monitor or screen - unlike the Paperwhite and Kindle which really look more like words on a page. As such there is a bit of a glare or reflection that can be annoying.The Paperwhite reads more like a book, is lighter and less bulky than the Fire, and has a built light so I can read in all lighting conditions. I haven't noticed any glare problems.The original Kindle can be very vanilla but is lightweight and easy to use.  But likely doesn't have a light so you can't read anywhere that you can't turn on a light.Some Kindles give ads and you get a cheaper Kindle.  I have the ad-free Fire and the Kindle and Paperwhite with ads. They aren't intrusive, are about books or Kindle accessories, so I don't mind them too much.
