I checked this out before purchasing it, and I am glad I did for I did not find the patterns in this book to be as "fabulous" as other reviewers did.  There really were just a couple that I would be interested in making and those do not include any of the sweater patterns which comprise most of the book.  The sweaters are very boxy and not particularly stylish -- not very Vogue, in my opinion!  Yes, they are knit with chunky yarn, but that doesn't always equal plain and boxy.  There is a variety of patterns here, with a couple hats; scarf; men's, women's and children's sweaters; even a pillow pattern.  Frankly, the only sweater I would consider making is a child's sweater, the only interesting, stylish one in the bunch, but I have no child to make it for!  If you are looking for a collection of sweaters that is "Vogue", stylish, or even just interesting, this is not the pattern book for you.  I also have to say that the size is nice for traveling, but would not be too easy to keep open if you are trying to follow along with a pattern and knit at the same time.
