As great an actor as Denzel Washington is, I had honestly grown a bit tired of all of his &quot;goodie-two-shoes&quot; roles, the most recent being &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and &quot;The Hurricane.&quot;  His performance in &quot;Training Day,&quot; however, has given me newfound respect for him as an actor unafraid to stretch himself beyong his usual (i.e. type-cast) artistic boundaries.  Not only does he play &quot;the bad guy&quot; in this powerful L.A. crime drama, but he milks its for all its worth - and makes it look easy!  His Alonzo Harris would make Dirty Harry look like Barney Fife on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show.&quot;  His winning the Best Actor Oscar at the 74th Annual Academy Awards on March 24 for this role was well-deserved.  This performance makes &quot;The Hurricane&quot; look like a cool summer breeze by comparison.  He is without a doubt the BEST actor of his generation.Ethan Hawke was equally exceptional.  Any young actor who can hold his own with the likes of Washington in a film like this deserves recognition.  His performance shows that he has a long and stellar career (and more Oscar nominations) ahead of him.&quot;Training Day&quot; is a blisteringly brilliant depiction of a rookie cop's one-day &quot;education&quot; on the L.A. narcotics beat from a veteran and self-proclaimed &quot;wolf among wolves.&quot;  It will slap you across the chops with its intensity, made all the more potent by two powerhouse performances that will stay in your mind long after the closing credits.
