This book combines a large amount of text with occasional crafts, only one of which is anything that a student would be mildly interested in. The print font is the size usually associated with a 3rd grade book; the vocabulary, sentence structure, density of the text, and difficulty level of the crafts, however, are better suited to much older students.
