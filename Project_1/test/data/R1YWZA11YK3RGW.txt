The Logitech has a much smaller subwoofer, which is nice if you are looking to save space - and it is about $10 cheaper.  Neither of the two are - in my estimation - expensive, so the $10 difference wasn't a factor for me.  I just wanted the better sounding of the two.  To my ears, the CA-3602 is a bit better sounding than the Logitech S220.  But not a lot.  If space or price is a consideration, then get the Logitech S220.  If a larger sub and $10 more isn't a problem for you, then I think the CA-3602 is the way to go.The Logitech S220 has nice crisp highs and mids, with a slight hint of thinness or sounding tinny at times.  The bass is very reasonable, especially considering the price of the unit and the size of the sub.  But it is also a bit muddy and imprecise at times - still, for the money it sounds incredible and I would have no problems recommending this unit to someone who was just looking for a good, solid, inexpensive speaker set for their computer.  For most people, this is probably all they will ever need in a sound system for their computer.You can't really go wrong with either, but I prefer the CA-3602 by a slight margin.
