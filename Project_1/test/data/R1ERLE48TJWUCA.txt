If anyone thinks this cable will do that, please don't give it 1 star when it doesn't.  This cable simply properly connects three RCA plugs on one end with the correct pins on an HD15 on the other end for devices that can use an HD15 for Component signals.There are exactly two situations where this cable will work.1. If your computer or video card has a CONFIGURABLE HD15 connector on it that allows you to choose Computer out OR Component out.  If your computer has this feature, and yes, some PCs and PC video cards do (mostly older ones, including some Radeons), then this cable should work for you.  No Mac as far as I know has this feature (using a VGA or HDMI connector), despite many begging apple to implement it (the hardware was capable).2. If you have a video monitor with an HD15 in that is configurable or autosenses a component signal coming in vs. a computer signal.  I happen to have one of these monitors (an older Panasonic Plasma professional monitor) and this cable works for this.  You can connect a 2nd (or 3rd, in my case) Component input to my monitor.  Why might this be of value?  Because it allows for one input to show a computer signal one day, a component signal another day.  And considering in a professional environment or a commercial installation, the in wall cable runs might be limited (and there may be no component cable run in the wall), this is a solution implemented by professional monitor companies to get the signal you need to a location that might already exist.If you don't have these situations, don't buy the cable, or if you do buy it, don't give it 1 star.  Just return it and feel silly in private.  It's not anyone's fault but your own when you don't buy the right product.
