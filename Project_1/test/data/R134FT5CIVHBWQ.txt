I am loving Kundalini Yoga with ravi/ana because I got results from the very first session and feel great every time I do it! If you are new to KY you are in for a surprise! It is more active than other styles you may have tried, but what is so fabulous about it is if I do nothing else in the day, I still feel I got it all done!!! In addition to toning and stretching and working you inside and out, the breathwork combined with the flowing movements give you some aerobic benefits.  This DVD has 2 sets which can be done together, or you can just do one.You can do this one straight out of bed and feel good that you've got everything covered health wise!
