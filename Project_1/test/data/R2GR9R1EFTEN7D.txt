Greenstar, who make this very good closer, also make one that's even better--it closes more smoothly: Touch'n Hold Smooth Single Kit - White.The closer on this page, like most of its kind, starts to close rather fast, and as you are stepping inside, may whack you on the Achilles tendon.Greenstar has a neat video that shows how their "smooth" version reduces this problem: http://www.touchnholddoorclosers.com/en/products/31/touch-n-hold-smooth/I have bought both closers and can confirm that the "smooth" version is much superior for this reason. It also includes the excellent step-on button to hold it open. Also available is a top-and-bottom pair which helps to ensure that the screen door closes more tightly at top and bottom: Touch'n Hold Smooth Dual Kit Storm and Screen Door Closer
