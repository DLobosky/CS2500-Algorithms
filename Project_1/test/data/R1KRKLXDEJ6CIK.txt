That said, I'd guess I'm part of the target market for this book. Some reviewers say this book assumes you know how to sew, and since I have a machine, there is a little truth to that. The problem is, how many pages should a beginner book spend covering your machine? Well, if you are truly new then you need a lot of comparative information and really that's something you can only get through dealers and seamstresses/tailor's, because a lot of your questions are probably covered by the manual and are also a matter of personal preference. This book doesn't cover a lot of this area- but I don't count that against it. I suggest new sewers do what I just outlined (see dealer or seamstress/tailor and ask), read their manual if they already own a machine or go to the library and browse the sewing section. If you go into the process entirely blind you'll unneccessarily spend money on a lesser book covering basics that may be machine or user specific.That said, I bought this book hoping to get enough from it to actually sew a garment or project after reading it. I'd say your chances of that as a new sewer are not impossible but not great. The reason is the topics seem kind of rushed over and out of context. It's as if someone assembled a bunch of articles but didn't take the time to explain how each one interrelates to the next. The pictures are nice but there could be more. All in all I was disappointed with this book. Since I've bought this book I've had a chance to look at a few other books in the same category (luckily my library has a pretty good selection). In hindsight I think the much better book is the New Complete Guide to Sewing (Readers Digest). It covers a wider range of topics and puts it all together, which is very important if you're to make heads or tails out of the vast language of sewing.Best of luck to all new sewers out there!
