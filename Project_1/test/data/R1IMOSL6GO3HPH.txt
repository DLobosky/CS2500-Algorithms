This album has a lot of great music to offer for the price.  It is a 2-CD collection of modern Christian worship songs.  Overall, it offers a great sampling from some of today's exciting Christian bands.  Although some of the songs are found on other albums (Matt Redman's &quot;Light of the World&quot;, Glo's &quot;My Glorious&quot;), or are not new songs (&quot;Open the eyes of my heart&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;I Could Sing of Your Love Forever&quot;) these versions are all good.  One other thing I like about this album is that the music covers a wide range of music styles from hard guitar-driven to more melodic slow songs.  It presents a nice balance.This album is a lot like the Revival Generation and Passion CDs, so if you like them, you will most likely enjoy this one also.  I recommend it to anyone who is into modern Christian music.  If you have not heard much (or any, for that matter) of this style music then this album could serve as a great starting point.  It has something to offer to everyone.
