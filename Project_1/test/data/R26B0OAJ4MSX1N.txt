The people who wrote this book did NOT write the Lightroom software--they are a group of writers and graphic designers (look at the bios in the back of the book!).  Not one is described as a photographer, either, which would have been a good background to have, considering the topic at hand.  It's true that the book is published under the Adobe name, but to think that a bunch of software engineers and computer code jockeys (bless their hearts) wrote this book, you're crazy.  The authors are hired by Adobe, and I doubt ever even meet the software writers.All that said, I like this book for SPECIFICS on how Lightroom works, but I don't agree with the way it treats topics: importing images, which would seemingly be covered early on, doesn't show up until page 82, a third of the way through the book. It does have a direct and to-the-point style, though, which I appreciate, thus 4 stars instead of 3.
