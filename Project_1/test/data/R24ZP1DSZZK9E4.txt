What transpires in this book are mainly background anecdotes related to the chain of events that led to the first meeting between the author Vladimir Megre and Anastasia, the writing of the first book in this series, and the aftermath of those events, that led to the writing of this book.This series is a story of history in progression. One notices the laser like impact that a single thought, called forth by a mind that is pure, can have, as obsolete social structures crumble to oblivion and newer streams of living energy emerge from the rubble, filled with a trembling vitality, into increasingly novel and varied forms of self expression. Some of the historical changes that have been implemented in Russia as a consequence of this book are the institutionalization of a public holiday on July 23rd as Earth Day and restoration of some sacred sites in the country that had hitherto been left desolate. Photographic evidence of the above is provided in the book. Reading this book gave me a picture of the soul of old Matushka Russia (I want to say this though Russia is not my motherland) awakening to renewed vibrancy and vitality after years of depression and disarray.But there is more to this book for Anastasia's insights are not restricted to the Russian context alone as mentioned in the above paragraph. In a certain chapter, there is a mention of the historical import of a certain English word (I don't want to risk a spoiler here) which came into being as a result of a battle between the Romans and Celts where the Celts were outnumbered nine to one. One senses a naturally inclusive mindset in this woman, who represents Man, a sense of being interconnected with all of Life. It is no coincidence, that many people, after having read this book, uncovered unknown talents of self expression, especially with poetry and music, talents they did not even know that they possessed.It would be unfair not to give the author, Vladimir Megre the credit that he amply deserves. He has, at least going by this book, clearly, not had an easy life. He has been more or less used by Anastasia as her representaative in the outside world, and therefore, made to endure the consequence of the (not unchaotic) flow of events that followed their meeting. There were financial crises, and family estrangement, among various other problems, but they gave him the time freedom that was needed to get the first book out in the world. The story of his writing of "Anastasia" is no less interesting than Anastasia's own, it is the story of falling structures and relationships, of help from unknown quarters and the forging of new friendships and insights.As I said before, reading this book made me feel that I am seeing history in the making. Not only that, a growing sense of deja vu, a chicken egg scenario where one thought, one desire, sets wheels into motion, initiating the kind of momentous changes one can only dream about. This book is a fast read and I recommend it whole heartedly, however, preferably to  be read after "Anastasia", the first book in the series, in order to imbibe a proper picture of the sequence of events.
