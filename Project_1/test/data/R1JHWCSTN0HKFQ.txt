&quot;Dear Cheyenne&quot; is a must for *everyone*.  For those of us who have not lost a child, this book gives a deep understanding of what it is like to lose a child.  Anyone who has ever said to a beareaved parent &quot;you're young, you can have another child&quot; does not understand the tragic loss of a child.  While this statement may be true, no child can replace another.  Through author Joanne Cacciatore's eyes, you will gain empathy, compassion and understanding of what it is like to lose a child.
