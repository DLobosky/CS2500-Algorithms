Not for Sale is not your typical work on the modern day slave trade because its' a quick read that packs a lot into a fairly compact 300 page package. Instead of some works that draw outrage out of the reader through tales of bloody sexual exploitation and deplorable conditions, Batstone makes his case through a common moral outrage that all human beings should share using meaningful and raw stories of victims, perpetrators, and those seeking to end human exploitation throughout the world. Many of these do not contain blood or media enhanced tales of abduction rather the terror from them comes the terror faced by laborers in India, Child Soldiers of the LRA, and the Street Children of Peru. Many books have neglected to focus on the plight of child soldiers and street children, so I thought that was a refreshing addition. The reason this book did not get five stars is that the stories presented in the book though informative, but the author jumps back and forth within chapters so much that it prevents the reader from latching onto one particular person or situation.
