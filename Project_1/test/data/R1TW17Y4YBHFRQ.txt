That is to say...The arrangements are very well done--definitely on the intermediate side, but not terribly so. A student who has been playing for 1-2 years should be able to reward themselves with at least the main theme after a few hours of work. And for this reason, I'd give to book a solid 4 stars.But the binding...it's the opposite of "lay flat", and woe unto anybody who tries to play from it without serious mechanical help. We have a page-spreading device, and it is barely a match for the binding, even though I have broken that binding in three places--near the beginning, in the middle, and near the end. The book binders were obviously oblivious to the considerations of how the book would be used.So...wonderful content, but not wonderfully executed as a book meant to rest open on a piano.
