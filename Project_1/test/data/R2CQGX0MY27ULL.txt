This is one of the strangest looking films I can remember. The sets make this film look like a biblical soap opera gone futuristic. I am not sure if this was director Victor Saville's intent or not. Filmed in CinemaScope by William V. Skall, it just looks so offbeat. Based on the novel by Thomas Costain, it deals with the trials and tribulations of a Greek, portrayed by Paul Newman, who designed the cup used at the Last Supper.The cast includes Virginia Mayo, Jack Palance, Pier Angeli, Joseph Wiseman, Natalie Wood, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene and Alexander Scourby.Franz Waxman's score and a cryptic performance by Jack Palance make this worth watching.This is an interesting film, which certainly follows a different path.
