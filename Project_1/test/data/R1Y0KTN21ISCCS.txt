We own both the plastic and wooden pattern blocks, and use and love both. I love the feel of the wooden ones, and since they have twice the thickness of the plastic ones you can use them to build more vertical structures. They are wonderful for building patterns as well as sorting and counting. My kids even use them for play food! I owned the plastic ones as a kid, and have many fond memories of playing with them for hours.
