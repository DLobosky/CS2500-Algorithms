In Best Buy type stores all they have are cases that will in fact hold a lot of disks, but are pretty flimsy in the long run. I found this particular "Media Wave" storage shelf at Bed Bath and Beyond and was hooked by the style and how sturdy it looked. Now I'm getting more.  This shelf is very solid. The panels are made of a denser composite board than I am used to seeing in other CD shelves. A single shelf I got from Best Buy that held three times the media was a good deal lighter than one of these. While that means they are heavier it also means stronger. The backboard is thick, solid and the shelving is screwed in. Not cardboard and hammered to the shelves with little tacks like other shelves I purchased. I'm no longer worried that my media shelf will break to pieces if manhandled. Putting it together is pretty easy. The shelves notch together kind of like those 3D puzzles and then screw in the back. The shelves are suitable for putting on the wall, but keep in mind the weight when mounting. I use it primary for holding CDs, and I say it can hold up to 14 CDs comfortably in each segment. With 15 segments in all that's 210 CDs. Now they advertise the shelf can hold DVD's and Blu-Rays, but I have to give a disclaimer. You can't fit them in it's intended configuration. You can, however, build the thing taking out shelves two and four. That will make plenty of room, but will only hold about 105 DVDs or maybe 150 Blu-Rays. Also it won't look as pretty what with the empty notches on the vertical shelving where the other shelves would have been. It's not too terribly noticeable, but it's not hidden either. For me these shelves are perfect. They are stylish, sturdy and modular. I already have a pretty functional movie media shelf so this for was strictly for my CD's, and I have a lot of them. I bought two initially and decided to get a third so that I can still enjoy the shelves as my collection increases. And considering the price it's worth it to buy a few of these as opposed to a bigger, blocky, and sometimes not as well built shelf. I recommend getting this only for your CDs as that's what they are built for. However if you like the style and don't mind doing a little "subtractive modification" on the shelf then you'll be happy storing your movies on this as well.
