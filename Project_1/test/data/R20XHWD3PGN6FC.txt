I am out on the water in a small boat alot and I simply would not be comfortable using my iphone on the boat without it. I tried keeping it in a watertight box which was safe but i could not hear it ring or comfortably touch it since I was usually wet! This is an awesome solution. The are careful to say it is not watertight and it definitely is not but on more than one occasion with my previous case, I had a little puddle of water sitting on the screen and it never went through the case! I would not recommend letting this happen but it did not let me down in those rough conditions. I have dropped it numerous times and never had any problems. On the other hand I dropped my phone face down on gravel a few minutes after taking it out of the otterbox and cracked the LCD screen so apparently you have to leave it in the case if it is going to help! LOL! I used the phone for 6 months with a cracked screen though and this case probably helped keep it from getting worse. The new case (I have had for 1 hour) seems equally well constructed and possibly even more secure but it could be that the silicone on my previous one was stretched out with use. One thing that is significantly worse than the old version is the 'holster'. The original model would probably have held onto it while you did cartwheels whereas this one will not hold the phone with even slight wiggling. They attempted to make it so that you could use it while it was in the holster but in doing so they did not leave enough to really grab the phone. Although your phone might survive falling out of the holster that won't help you if you don't notice or it falls in the water! I may use this to clip in my bag so that the phone does not get buried but would not trust if for a second clipped anywhere it could fall away!I chose white because my phone is white and it looks awesome plus it will be easier find in dark lined bags but I have a feeling it will be getting pretty dirty and suspect the silicone will not be cleanable. That is not a flaw with the case, just something to think about!Also, lots of reviews have commented that this case adds bulk and that it does but there is no way around it for this kind of protection. If you are looking for day to day use and just worry about an occasional drop you may be able to get away with something thinner.Note: if you used the old model you will be pleasantly surprised that you can now access the silent button through the case!UPDATE: I just noticed on the MFR website that the holster is designed to hold the phone face in rather than face out as in the old model. It seems to be shown both way in the illustrated 'instructions'. I thought I tried that but must not have tried hard enough! It is quite secure when it is face in! Oops! I would change it to 5 stars if Amazon would let me!
