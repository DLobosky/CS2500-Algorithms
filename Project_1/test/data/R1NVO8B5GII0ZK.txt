Perhaps they received fakes, as there have been some fake Sennheiser CX-300 II earbuds out there.For me, I found the build to be excellent! The main plug & cord is of that thick, rubbery silicone material. Putting them in the little spring bag provided, they NEVER get tangled up. My old Sonys were forever tangling every time I used them. The cords to the ear pieces seem very sturdy. With three choices of rubber tips, I used the medium size and the fit was great & very comfortable.The sound was great & when I pumped up the bass, that was excellent as well.I bought these for twenty-five dollars after a five-dollar online rebate. At BB, they were sixty. What a deal!
