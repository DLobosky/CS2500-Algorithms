Plenty of others have summarized the films before and said whether or not they liked them so I will dispense with that and focus strictly on the quality of the transfer of the 3 films to Blu Ray.'Training Day' on BluRay was better than I expected once the disc was in. The Mbps rate ranged between the low teens and mid twenties at best.  You would expect to see a lot of grain in this film, especially because there were so many dark scenes but the transfer wasn't bad and had good, warm color grading, natural skin tones and was free from artifacts, dirt or ghosting.  However, I did see in one scene where the car turns right in front of some overhanging phone/electric lines some very real stair-stepping in the lines themselves.  My gut feeling is that the transfer to blu ray was just that, a transfer without any serious remastering.  This means that the Standard Def version wasn't bad either and I doubt you would see much difference from the upgrade to Blu Ray.  The lack of an upgrade of the audio bolsters my thoughts on this.  The audio is lossy Dolby Digital 5.1.  You can get used to listening to lossy audio until you hear the difference between it and a lossless version.  Very disappointed in the audio, not because the levels were poor or the dialogue unintelligible, but because the panning and use of the discreet channels for foley fx would have been greatly enhanced if the audio had been a lossless one. However, most of the audio is strictly across the front stage.  Great movie though and too bad it was not really remastered.  There were unfinished deleted scenes and an alternate ending scene as well as trailers, commentary and music videos.'Pelican Brief' -Exciting political thriller.  There was great color with a soft muted focus, realistic grading, no artifacts or problems that I could see. Mbps from 7 to 35.The audio was  Dolby Digital HD lossless which is always good , however theaudio is spread across the front stage with no real use of your surround system for panning or Foley FX or sub for this dialogue driven film. You do need to go to the audio menu as the film defaults to compressed Dolby Digital 5.1  There were no extras of any kind other than a trailer.'John Q'-Great medical thriller.  Video-some early grain especially in the background but appears to clear up.  Mbps is high 20's to low 30's. The Audio defaults to DD 5.1 so be sure to change to PCM HD lossless in the menu.Audio is primarily dialogue ,but both sound stages are used for soundtrack and ambience and even some discreet foley fx from both front and rear channels.  Lots of extras including alternative and deleted scenes, commentary and more. Over all, 5 star movie and 4 star transferWhile it is great to get 3 movies on 3 separate discs for such a low price, if you already have them on Standard Def DVDs, do not expect to see a remarkable difference between the two formats if you see any difference at all.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks
