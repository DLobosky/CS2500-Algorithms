Also included in the book complete with photographs is a comprehensive biography of L Ron Hubbard.The actual story is typical of the type written at the time when authors had to bash out stories in minimal time to meet editor's time scales and often paid by the word. However it is still a good story that does not seem, apart from the language to have dated. Without giving away much of the plot it is soon discovered, first few pages, that there are murders being carried out by people that are known to be dead. From this start the story progresses with a number of murders with the detective just too late until the final climax where there is a bit of a twist. Good reading if only to get a flavour of this type of book.
