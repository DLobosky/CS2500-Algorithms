No matter what kind of a mood I'm in, I'm always entertained by reading Garfield comic strips.  I have no problem admitting that, even though I'm in my early twenties.  I think it's a very hilarious strip and it gets better with every year.  "Garfield: Feeds the Kitty" is yet another very amusing collection of funny Garfield strips.Laugh along as Garfield takes on dieting, Mondays, his owner Jon, the very not-so-bright Odie, smart-aleck mice who always get the last laugh, and much more.  With Garfield, you know it's never a dull day (even if HE finds it dull).Again, Jim Davis never misses a beat with making Garfield funny and entertaining.  While some strips are funnier than others, the overall product is very satisfying.  You'll want to re-read the book over and over again.  It's a great read, especially when you need some cheering up.The 35th book in the Garfield series, "Garfield: Feeds the Kitty" is a very hilarious collection of Garfield hijinx that you won't want to miss out on.  If you're a Garfield fan, I highly recommend you checking it out.  Always nice to have something that is bound to get a laugh or two from you.
