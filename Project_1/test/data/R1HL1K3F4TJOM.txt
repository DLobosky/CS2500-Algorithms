The engines' stockings were going to be hung soon and Thomas didn't want to miss that. But Thomas was a Really Useful Engine and he had three very important deliveries to make...and they could not wait." -- From the bookMy son is an ardent fan of Thomas the Tank Engine, so we have quite a few of the Thomas books. Most reinforce the same rudeness, pettiness, and competitiveness of the TV series. However, Thomas' Christmas Delivery offers quite a different tale. One snowy day, the night before Christmas, Thomas must make three important scheduled deliveries--food for the Community Hall for the big celebration, parcels to the school for the children that were unable to go home for the holidays, and presents for the residents of the Children's Hospital in Vicarstown. It just so happens that Sir Topham Hatt comes out of the hospital, telling Thomas he has a very important job for him: delivering a toy train to a little boy with a broken leg.Thomas is worried that Father Christmas will forget him, especially since Thomas' stocking wasn't hung before he left.Thomas perseveres in the dark, snowy night, delivering the toy to the ecstatic--and grateful--injured boy and his Mom. Ever so slowly, Thomas makes his way home--exhausted.Happily, his stocking is filled the next morning with the very thing he wanted most--coal!The lavish illustrations by Tommy Stubbs are stunning. The people--carolers, Mrs. Kyndley, the trains--look so life-like. Snow-laden trees, billowing steam, colorful presents, cheery lighted windows--the images are almost photo-realistic at times. I've not seen a finer illustrated Thomas book thus far.The story is engaging and heartwarming, and it's great to (finally!) see a Thomas story that's not centered around rudeness or harassment. Only one other train makes an appearance in Thomas' Christmas Delivery--Percy--and he peeps "Good morning, Thomas! Merry Christmas!" as the two discover their filled stockings.This is a lovely Christmas book for fans of Thomas the Tank Engine series. The sparkling holographic silver snowflakes on this hardcover book adds a nice touch, as well.A joy to read--especially with the gorgeous illustrations--Thomas' Christmas Delivery is a wonderful addition to any child's library.
