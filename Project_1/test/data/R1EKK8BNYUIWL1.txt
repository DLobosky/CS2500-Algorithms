Big mistake. It's got so many watchdog features that your computer is popping up warning messages everytime you visit a website. My main gripe is that it slows down my Gmail account so much that completing an email without a freeze-up for 45-90 seconds is virtually impossible.Now the good news. The 2006 and prior versions of Trend Micro have been wonderful- simple to use and effective. As I said, they've kept a bunch of computers virus-free for years, unlike some of the other Big Boys in the internet security business, which we used previously. Our computers are online much of the time, and in spite of high internet usage, they have been virus-free. The software is easy to use, and it's got all the needed bells & whistles, offering effectless protection, without slowing down your computer.  I highly recommend the 2006 version, which is available here on Amazon and at other online retailers.
