Good in both damp & dry hair, though mostly I add it to dry hair in the morning - scrunch in the shape, fluff it up & air dry. Keeps my hair in shape & eliminates flyaways. Gives my hair easy, quick volume that doesn't fall flat all day - that impressed me.This gel is super-sticky & holds my lazy waves into nice cute curls & shape but the finish is very soft & pliable, so I'm at a loss as to how this gel can hold spikes. My hair is too long to experiment that way (chin-length bob) but probably on short hair it's possible to create spikes - I would still imagine that additional hairspray would be needed to hold them up...? This is not a very stiff gel, & it feels a tad heavy while still wet. Anyway I like that it holds well but still leaves my hair looking natural AND feeling soft & touchable (but not combable of course, as strands are stuck together in pieces). Smells nice & washes out easily.It's not the best hair gel I've ever used (I prefer Redken Elastic Gel which is stronger) but it's useful for my needs & I do like it.
