A good student level description about 'The Blue Riders, Bauhaus, Tunisia,Dusseldorf and beyond.The artwork reproductions are standard KLee stuff.  The middle of the Klee highway.  The color quality is ok, not impressive.But for this price this proves to be a good Klee introduction.Please see our other klee reviews.
