The film opens with one of the most beautiful tracking shots at a gas station that harkens back to Orsen Welles' perfection in camera movement in The Magnificent Ambersons and Citizen Kane. The framing in every single shot is perfection. Lotte, in the chapter, Lotte Dies, is shown up close in a single shot talking on the phone with her mother. The framing is close to her, and gives no hint to where she is sitting. The conversation starts friendly and nicely with her mother. The camera begins to move back to reveal more and more of where Lotte is sitting. As this happens, her mother starts to say that Lotte is on her own. As she slams the phone down, the viewer realizes Lotte is sitting in a cramped phone booth, and ultimately looks imprisoned in her surroundings. The viewer knows she is going to die, it's clear that this moment is the turning point. This film could serve as a semester course in film study. The richness and perfections of the framing, camera movement, story line, editing is incredible. Place this against a backdrop of politics, love, family, happenstance, and this is a formula for a classic masterpiece. Although this will never be an important film in cinema history, it is one for film students to understand and use.The story is told in three acts, The Death of Yeter, The Death of Lotte, and The Edge of Heaven. Each is virtually a short story of it's own, almost stand as individual films. However, each is bound by, what at first, appear to be happenstance. The director has woven these subtle moments that make complete sense later in the film. Each story overlaps from a timeline viewpoint. The second act starts before the first act ends in strict linear time. Much has been written about the political aspect of this film. Frankly that all seems to be a red herring to this reviewer. This is a film more like Lelouch's A Man and A Woman, where seemingly random events happen that drive the story toward it's logical conclusion. Politics is simply a pretext, or another of those random events. A very well told story. Supported by incredibly cinematography. Editing that is spot on. Characters that are so believable that the viewer knows them well by the end of the film. Focus that is perfect in every single shot. A rare film today. Camera movement and production that means something.This is not a film for everyone. It's an art film, it is not pure simple entertainment. It requires a certain level of thinking and careful watching to fully appreciate. For the person willing to pay attention and think, this is a hugely rewarding film. This would be an R rated film if the MPAA rated it. There is absolutely no nudity, however the film opens with a very mature subject matter, prostitution and a man asking and receiving. The moment is probably the farthest in the world from being purile, no act is ever shown. This moment could not be changed, it is critical to the story. There is some violence, and a bit of strong language. Again, all perfectly constructed and with reason. Edge of Heaven really harkens back to the art house film of the 70's and early 80's. But this is a modern perfectly done film. Anyone that is a student of film, or loves film for film sake will adore this film. It represents all that can be good in film.
