I picked this up at a local retailer. Looks good and the sound is pretty good. Didn't seem much better or worse than my 10 year old Denon receiver it replaced (but that's not a bad thing). Video over HDMI looks good.Setup is pretty usual for receivers, you will not understand many features and setup options unless you bother reading the instructions.Few shortcomings with one that is very annoying:1. The cover of the front USB and video/audio ports is not connected to the receiver - it's a piece of plastic that you have to take out completely if you want to hook up a USB device or any source to the front connectors. I wish it had a permanent connection because I can completely see it getting lost.2. The receiver comes with a limited on screen menu to use the auto tuning of speakers and to set up the inputs and speakers. The problem is: you have to connect the receiver to the TV using an analog RCA cable to use it!!!! So if you have only digital sources and hoped to use HDMI as your only connection, be prepared to add another cable to the mix when you set up the speakers. Granted you don't need to use the on screen menu a lot but if you have difficult access to the back of TV and receiver like I have, it can become annoying. I don't understand what Pioneer were thinking.3. Seems to have to crank up the volume much higher than I used to with my Denon receiver, but I guess this is something I will have to get use to.Overall it is a great value, but I'm actually considering returning it and spending the extra $100 for the vsx-920-k so I won't have to use analog RCA cables ever again.
