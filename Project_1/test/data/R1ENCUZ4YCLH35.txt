Diana Gabaldon takes what could be just another sappy romance novel and infuses it with great writing, accurate research and lots of fun. The characters are all so real and vibrant that I feel as if I actually know them. This rich characterization goes beyond just the two main characters -- Clare and Jamie. So many of the other people in the book come alive and make you want to know them more. I highly recommend this book to everyone I know. Almost all of them have become Outlander addicts as well.
