I don't know if Eclipse will be a good movie or not (the previews have not captured my interest). But regardless of the movie, the Eclipse soundtrack is REALLY good and it`s also a stand alone. After sampling the songs, I knew I wanted to add it to my keeper shelf!  There are songs on this cd that are just great. However since I am rating this whole cd, there are some songs on it that did not capture me, and that's why it all rounds up to 4 stars. My rating for the songs are as follows: 1. Eclipse (all yours) 5/5 stars 2. Nuetron Star collision (Love is Forever) 5/5 stars (great mixture of classical and rock) 3. Ours 3/5 stars 4. Heavy in your arms 5/5 stars (and more! this is possibly the best song on this cd) 5. My Love 5/5 stars (beautiful, melodic song, filled with longing) 6. Atlas 3.5/5 stars 7. Chop and Change 4.5/5 stars 8. Rolling in on a burning tire 4/5 stars 9. Let's Get Lost 4/5 stars 10. Jonathan Low 4.5/5 stars 11. With You in my head 4/5 stars 12. A Million Miles an hour 4/5 stars 13. Life on Earth 3/5 stars 14. What Part of Forever 3.5/5 stars 15. Jacob's theme 4/5 stars (I like melodic instrumental music. But instead of Jacob's theme, there should have been Edward's theme) In the end, this cd provides a very enjoyable listening experience! I like it!
