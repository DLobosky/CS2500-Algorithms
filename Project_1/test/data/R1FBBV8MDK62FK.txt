While Jack the Ripper is not my primary area of research, I have read a good amount of historically significant publications regarding the Whitechapel Murders and the Thames Torso Murders. Trenouth's information in this book conflicts with some of the most widely accepted and factual historical findings in the research community. For example, Trenouth claims that there is a Baphomet idol in the 2nd picture of the fifth victim Mary Jane Kelly, however if you look at the picture, you can clearly see what Trenouth is referring to is actually a pile of flesh. Trenouth claims this book was a result of her own research. I found this quite disturbing as several of Trenouth's passages were direct copy n' pastes from numerous respected authors and researchers on the JtR casebook site. What Trenouth did manage to write was a muddled distortion of imaginary facts that failed produce her promised result. Trenouth's book is very troublesome in that regard. It's scary to see that one can write anything one wants and pass it off as fact.  Even more disturbing is that Trenouth proudly touts that she has solved the case, but none of the thoughts presented in this book prove who JtR was. I am not suggesting the plot of Trenouth's book is imaginary, but even the land of make believe has standards.To be fair, I guess I'm not the target audience for this book. It's really more the result poorly written self-published work of un-organized imaginary thoughts. (The kind of book you might read while wearing a tin foil hat.) But it troubles me that the bulk of the information is wrong, yet touted at stone cold fact. It is definitely a quick read, but that's only if you don't try to re-read the the parts that simply don't add up. I guess it would look good on your shelf, if you know nothing about the Whitechapel Murders. As long as no one else has studied JtR, you could probably convince them that you too, are a self-proclaimed ripper expert who has "solved" the case.Bottom line, I am kicking myself for having paid "used price" for Trenouth's book. If you can get one for .01 and you interested by the mixed reviews, why not give it a try?...but don't get your hopes up. I personally won't be buying anymore of Trenouth's books.(((Notice how the positive review below is *NOT* an Amazon "Real Name" user)))
