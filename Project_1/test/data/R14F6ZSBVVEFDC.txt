It has very few features and very few of the mechanical and technological updates one would expect in a modern television.   This television set offers the usual minimum features a consumer expects to find in any television- like adjustments for color, brightness, etc.- along with a few extras, like a language control that allows the consumer to switch from English to Spanish to French, sleep timer, and close captioning. Most all features have to be accessed from the remote control- the front of the television offers no such options- not even to access the menu. Also, there is only one input jack on the back of the television, placing severe limits on accessory compatibility. If there is one redeeming factor for this television set, it is the quality of the picture.This surprised me at first, because the overall quality of most everything else is below average, leading me to believe that the picture quality would follow suit. But the picture is actually quite good on Philips Magnavox PR1903C. The sharpness is very good and I cannot detect any small lines or other problems with the viewing. In this regard, the television set deserves commendation. I can't really find anything wrong with the picture quality for this type of set. Going back to the negative points, I have noticed that this television set is prone to wear out a little faster than others. One sign of wear that is easily noticeable is the button on the front of the screen, to access the power. This button is a large, round button that is plastic in construction and is enclosed inside a round space. When pressing the button in, it is supposed to snap solidly in place but instead it rattles back and forth a little, making me worry that it is going to pop off. Of course, the way it is situated inside the round space, it cannot come out (as far as I know). But the looseness is obvious and it is a little surprising. With the limited amount of times the power button on the front of the television set is used (it is usually powered on/off with the remote control), I wouldn't expect it to wear out so quickly.Overall, Philips Magnavox PR1903C is an unacceptable television set for the many reasons listed above. I like the sleep timer and the picture quality is certainly very good, but the strikes against this television are numerous. There are too many bad points to make it worthy of a recommendation.
