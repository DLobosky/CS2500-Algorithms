I was looking for a good deal on a decent 2.4GHz phone with caller ID but without an answering machine. There are cheaper ones out there for almost the same features as this one, but I've used Panasonic phones before and I've come to trust them a lot. This one certainly has certainly boosted my confidence in Panasonic even more! Here are the pros of this phone:1) The quality of the sound is absolutely great, no one would ever know you're using a cordless phone. Even the speakerphone is really good. I use it quite often - it's very handy carrying the phone around with you everywhere and not having to put it by your ear all the time.2) The range is super (I've tested my unit at least a 100 feet away from the house, and it was crystal clear!). 3) I've had no problems at all with battery life. (I'm just mentioning this based on other reviews I've seen about this phone).4) The phone has 2 ringer volumes (low and high) and 6 different tunes - this was important to me since I was going to keep the phone in the bedroom and didn't want a loud or annoying ring to wake me up. I ended up choosing a low ringer volume with a nice melodious tune and I simply love it! I don't wake up grumpy anymore when the phone rings and wakes me up!5) For the caller id, the phone groups together the same phone number and just lists that number once and tells you how many times that number called you. For instance if someone called you 16 times from the same phone number, the caller ID list would show that number only once, followed by 'x16'. Thought that was pretty cool.Here are the cons of this phone:1) When reviewing the caller id list, if you delete the numbers one by one, it takes very long for a single deletion. Deleting all the numbers one by one takes forever. You can 'clear all', but obviously you can't use that if you'd like to keep one or two numbers (which is what I typically like to do).So overall, I think the phone is a little on the expensive side, but certainly worth the money. The speakerphone on the handset and the different ringer tunes are (in my opinion) two of the best features of this phone!
