Good quality M3 screws,they don't feel like they would strip easily. They appear to be 5mm long which is the normal length but might be too long for some motherboard standoffs in that case you might need a 4mm screw. Counted 50 as promised which means good QC by manufacturer. Overall a good product every builder should purchase, can never have too many screws. Provided pictures of packaging and length.
