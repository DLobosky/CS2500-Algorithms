I definitely prefer "Dance off the Pounds" to the "Dance Body Tone" DVD.However, it was hard to go into DVD with an open mind since I loved "Dance Off the POunds" so much, but if you do, you will find that it is actually a good workout, if you put the energy the instructors have for these moves into it.The first section was Latin dance with Kym. It's called an "ab blast" but honestly, I didn't feel as though I was doing anything really strenuous. There is Rhumba, Cha Cha and Merengue here. The moves are pretty good, not fast paced and easy to get down on the first try. But that was the problem I had. It felt more like I was swaying my hips continuously for 15 mins and that's all. I was a little let down with this section and worried that they were reverting back to the older DWTS DVDs. But I was pleasantly surprised that the next day, my abs and hips did feel like they were worked, albeit not sore exactly, but "stretched out". So this section DID serve it's purpose.Second up was the Tango/Argentine Tango section with Dmitry. This section was a lot of fun and I felt sexy doing it. I didn't work up a huge sweat since the tango is not a fast dance, and the moves are broken down slowly. But doing the leg flicks you see them do on the show was a lot of fun. Great little section but I really didn't think it was toning anything. Well here I am the day after and let me tell you, was I wrong! My legs and butt are a little sore and I am really surprised. The thing with this section is, you are doing a lot of lunges and steps that you "sit in" so you are doing a lot of thigh and glute work! And you don't realize that. So it was a really pleasant surprise.Last up was the Freestyle section with Lacey. Like a previous reviewer said, this was the only section that had a routine all the way through and broke down the moves as you go. This section was a lot of fun and had some cute moves. It got my heart rate up since it was pretty much straight on cardio. This was really the only section that made me tired.Finally there is a 5-6 minutes cool down and stretch to top everything off.Overall this is a good workout. As I was doing it, while it was fun, I wasn't extremely impressed. And I wasn't nearly as exhausted after doing this as I was after the "Dance off the Pounds" workout. But I did feel it the next day, so that was a plus. It's nice to know I didn't waste 50 minutes on a workout that did nothing. I think the key here is to REALLY get into the moves and execute them correctly, otherwise you will not get any benefit from this. While I won't reach for this DVD nearly as much as I will the "Dance Off the Pounds" workout, this is good for those lighter days when you don't want to workout but really want to do SOMETHING.
