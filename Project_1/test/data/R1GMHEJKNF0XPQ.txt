But little did I expect that the MORNING AFTER I set up this HP multi-function machine that the scanner would break and become UNUSABLE--at least the sheet feeder which really becomes the main selling point for buying this particular model.  What makes this model different than so many at the less than $100 price point is that it has a sheet feeder for the scanner when so many don't--you usually have to pay a lot more for that feature.The problem is that the sheet feeder is garbage!  I scanned FIVE ENTIRE PAGES WITH IT before it broke!I've worked many office environments with sheet fed scanners.  The normal life on those are several THOUSAND pages.  Even for basic desktop models and even for those in multi-function machines like this one.In addition, the printer uses just TWO CARTRIDGES--WITH TERRIBLE INK REPLACEMENT VALUES.  The ink for this machine is VERY EXPENSIVE and you will use a LOT OF IT!  It's an ink hog, no matter what the thing tells you.  Since I had a descent amount of work to do the week the printer arrived, I held onto the machine for an extra week or so after the scanner broke since the printer still worked.  In just seven days of normal office printing, the black ink RAN OUT.  And genuinely...I was not running off that many documents.  A few letters here and there.  What you might expect for a small office.It's an ink hog!  Definitely a poor choice for a small business, much less a larger one!  The speed seems fine, but if the scanner doesn't work and the ink runs out all the time and it's expensive to use, do you really care about the speed?Another thing to tell you about:  it has no separated place to feed the printouts.  It feeds your printouts in a very awkward way that ultimately ends up in a mess on the floor.  No separate tray or area.  You end up with this pile of scattered paper everywhere.  No ability to just tell it to print and walk away, particularly if you have to print something with more than 2 pages in it.  It's completely chaotic and horrible to use!  You have to babysit this machine all the time--and waste a lot of time.It's also very big and VERY HEAVY.  I'm a fairly small, petite lady.  I had a very hard time lifting it and putting it on my table to set up.Probably the one good thing I can say about it is the setup which is relatively painless, but does require a USB printer cable (not included).  Make sure you have one on hand should you risk everything and buy this.  It's a fairly painless install.  On the other hand, it puts MASSIVE AMOUNTS of junk on your machine.  To uninstall this from my computer after I returned it, it took 8 full minutes for the removal.  How many program suites do you know take 8 minutes to remove?  It dumps the kitchen sink on your machine, so if you care about that kind of thing, it's something to consider.Also, whatever it says...this model is NOT WIRELESS.  Only specific sub-models are wireless.  This one is NOT.  Only works through a wired connection.Overall, I think it's a machine you should be wary of.  There are better machines on the market.  Look elsewhere!
