This DVD is NOT as bad as some of the reviewers here are saying. Unfortunately, it's not really that good, either. It's a collection of 21 shorts (and I mean REALLY short, most of them are less than three minutes) that make fun of things ranging from &quot;Survivor,&quot; &quot;Fear Factor,&quot; &quot;Iron Chef&quot; and other TV shows. The writing is actually pretty good -- funny gags that fit the old Looney Tunes in the modern era.But the animation on these toons is TERRIBLE. Yeah, they're webtoons, but they're jerky and slow and, frankly, worse than the animation on 70s cartoons like &quot;Fat Albert.&quot; It's almost painful to watch. The &quot;special features&quot; are pretty lackluster as well.If you can ignore the awful animation and just try to enjoy the shorts, it's not bad, although it may have been easier to swallow if Warner Bros had condensed this and &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; into one two-hour collection instead of two one-hour collections. It would feel like you're getting more for your money.
