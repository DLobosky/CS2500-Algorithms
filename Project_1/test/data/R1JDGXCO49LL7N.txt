The Devil in a totally different dimension! Liz Hurley plays an excellent and extremely goodlooking Devil who is out to get Elliot's (Brendan Fraser's) soul. In return for his soul, Elliot, a lonely work-aholic, gets 7 wishes.Unexpected and funny twists make the movie well worth seeing. Elliot's main aim in the movie is to be loved by the woman of his dreams, Alison. However, in every one of his wishes, the Devil tries to mess things up and Elliot ends up being a number of charcters. (Eg: drug lord, NBA star and emotionally sensitive person)If you're up for a laugh and some excellent acting, watch the movie. I have seen it several times and every time it's great.
