These episodes started happening after the birth of my first child.The only thing I can do is go home and lay down. Ibuprofen doesn't help, and Vicodin just puts me to sleep. The only thing that helps is professional massage/physical therapy and, now, the inversion table. I was skeptical about using one of these so I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars. This model (the Pro-Deluxe) is reasonably priced at about $120 (all the others I saw were over $250). It's an odd feeling at first, but I felt the pain relief almost immediately. And you don't have to be on it very long in order to feel the benefits. I usually use it about 8-10 minutes every day and I feel that's enough. If you have back pain, I recommend that you give inversion therapy try. It beats taking any type of drug, and it doesn't take much time to get relief.
