I trust Suzanne Young to write an amazing book.  I do.  Honestly, 100%.  But I still wasn't sure how she was going to pull this one off.  I just felt like the description of this one just seems a bit far fetched.  The thing is, I was completely convinced!  A good author can take what seems like a far fetched idea and convince you that it could really happen, and Suzanne did that.  She weaved all these things together that really made this book work incredibly well.I'm starting with the romance this time around because it was such a major part of the story.  I really loved that Sloane and James have an established relationship.  They truly love each other and have an amazing connection.  I really felt the love they had for each other.  And when things kept falling down around them they always had each other.  But when things go from bad to worse and they can't continue as they were, then how will it all work?  Well, I can't tell you that, but it all worked out perfectly.  Even though there was what could have been a love triangle thrown in, or a love wrench maybe, it didn't ever really come to that.  And what plays out was absolutely perfect.  Things aren't easy, they go through hell, but how things end up made me happy.  The romance in this book was incredible.I really liked Sloane.  She's strong, even when she's losing it, when her life is crumbling around her.  She still has this survival instinct even when she's wanting to die (or thinks she might want to die).  She really doesn't have anyone to trust at times in the book and while it wears on her, she pushes through. And while there was one small portion where I wanted to slap her, for the most part she was a fantastic character.The whole plot of this book is very unique and pushes us to really think about things.  In this society suicide is an epidemic and they say it's contagious, but we see that kids are pushed to the edge, terrified they'll end up in The Program and that pushes them to actually commit suicide.  So is The Program helping, or is it what is actually causing the epidemic?  We get to think all this through as we read because it seems clear that suicide rates are high, and maybe depression really is worse then average, maybe due to some environmental reason, but is it really as bad as everyone makes it out to be?  Would things be better without The Program?  I really enjoyed thinking about all this so much, and debating it in my head.  I think that this will be explored in the next book more and I really look forward to it!The end of this one is perfect.  There's not this big cliffhanger or anything, but yet we REALLY want to know what comes next. I also had a very hard time putting this book down.  Every time I started reading, I wanted to keep reading until I finished.I do have to give a warning for this one.  I would say it's for mature readers as there's clear sexual relations, though it's off page, it's very clearly implied.  And just the subject matter itself might be sensitive to some.  I think the description will give you a pretty good idea whether this is one you should consider or not.  I know I absolutely loved the book and for that reason I very highly recommend it!
