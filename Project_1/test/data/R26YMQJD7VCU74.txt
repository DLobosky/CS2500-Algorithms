For those of us living inside the big, neon capitalist bubble that is America, it is often shocking to hear details about US policy abroad abroad. Saddam Hussein is a bad man, granted, but most Americans are completely unaware that the US armed him in the 1980s, thereby giving him the firepower he needed to massacre tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds. Moreover, not too many Americans know that the US and the UK are now engaged in deadly biological warfare in Iraq: "The destruction of infrastructure and banning of imports to repair it has cased disease, malnutrition, and early deaeth on a huge scale, including more than 500,000 children, according to UNICEF investigators - an average of 5,000 children dying each moth.... The US and Britain have taken the lead in blocking aid programs - for example, delaying approval for ambulances on the grounds that they could be used to transport troops, and barring insecticides for preventing the spread of disease and spare parts for sanitation systems." All the while, as innocent Iraqi people are dying and Saddam Hussein remains in pwer, the US continues to purchase Iraqi oil - only now its pennies on the dollar as dictated by the "Oil for Food" program. Of course, the story is much more detailed than this, and Chomsky's book helps flesh out some of these details that never seem to end up in mainstream media sources. But Chomsky doesn't just limit his analysis to Iraq. In this book, he provides a global survey of all the so-called Rogue States: The Balkans, East Timor, Colombia, Cuba and Latiin America in general. Chomsky also throws in commentary on European colonial history, imperialism, the rise corporate capitalism, and critiques the modern global economy. This is compact and potent Chomsky: a factual wrap sheet placed within the historical context of Empire and conquest. If you are looking for a quick intro to Chomsky's views, this is a good place to start. Perhaps Chomsky's most readable critique of the "Washington Concensus." At times repetetive, but then Chomsky is getting old. A good read.
