I started reading this book and it barely held my interest. I kept going hoping it would get better. Then I got to the part when Marcinko starts bragging about his Viet Nam days. He goes out on patrol at night, swims in the dark and kills 4 or 5 Viet Kong. Big [...] deal! A few dead bodies here, a few there... How in the [...] did that make one bit of difference in a war that was a mistake to begin with! This book is a "me...me...me" story; I guess if you can get by this Marcinko's ego it is not a "bad" read.  But there are so many other great books out there, I'd recommend a pass on this one.
