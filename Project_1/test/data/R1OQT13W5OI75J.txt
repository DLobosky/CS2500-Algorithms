This isn't a fast-paced, heavy duty workout, but those aren't for everyone, are they?  Liz Gillies is a knowledgeable, cheery instructor.  The DVD contains three separate programs.  All of them are sprinkled with Liz's words of encouragment and instruction.  You will get a good workout and even sweat (especially in the first program) if you follow her instructions.  If this helps, I'm 42 years old and in pretty good shape, but I'm not (remotely) Karen Voight or Kathy Smith or Denise Austin...In the Fat Burning workout Liz tells you how to keep your heart rate elevated--even while lying on your back.  It starts with brief instructions about the ball, a short warm-up, and continues with a cardio section that consists of a lot of bouncing on the ball and lifting your arms which is fun, but also works your legs (if you use them instead of just bouncing).  Then it has two segments that keep your heartrate up:  a standing leg work section--mostly lunge-type exercises--followed by a good arms workout--standing up and lifting the ball.  Maybe I'm a weakling, but it puts my arms to work!  The last part is a challenging (for me) workout for legs and abs lying on the floor with legs on the ball which also challenges your balance.  This is followed by a cool-down.The second workout, Pilates on the floor, I don't do as often as the others.  My DVD is a few years old and I hope they've fixed the problem with the audio which cuts out part-way through the program and comes back later.  You miss the audio instructions on several of the exercises, but can follow along by watching.  Despite that problem I liked the ball workouts so much I kept the defective DVD.  The exercises are good for toning,especially abs, and there aren't so many repetitions that you end up hating life, Liz, and exercise.The third workout is a toning workout on the ball.  I think it's a good workout, but I'm not as fond of toning as I should be, so I don't do it as often as the first one.  I like it that Liz says, &quot;I know it's hard, I'm feeling it too&quot; and &quot;I'm glad that's over&quot; during and after a couple of the leg exercises.  She mostly works the legs and abs--Pilates stuff--and not the arms.I think these are good workouts though a little short, about 30 minutes each. The DVD is a better value than some because you get three workouts.
