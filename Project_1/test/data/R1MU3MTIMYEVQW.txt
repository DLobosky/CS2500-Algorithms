This is definitely in my top movies, in fact, it is among the best movies I have ever seen. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10. Here is how the movie goes: It is Christmastime in Los Angeles, California and a man named John McClane is returning home to his family for the holidays, even though he is normally a police cop on his own or on a swat team. He talks to his wife, and they get into a bit of an argument. Meanwhile, in the center of the hotel where John and his family, not only his wife, but also his son and daughter, are, lots of people are singing, partying and celebrating Christmas. Nobody knows of nor expects the fact that a group of money hungry terrorists are on their way, and they all want this hotel's wealth. On top of that, they want to take some people hostage so no one can follow them. Their leader, Hans Gruber, takes a man captive, and tries convincing him to hand the money over, but the man refuses. Gruber promptly shoots him in the head. John sees that there are terrorists, and he gets some guns and hunts them down, forgetting his shoes! That's right-he fights all these evil people BAREFOOT! He fights and kills some terrorists, then comes across a member of Hans Gruber's gang who REALLY wants to tear him in half. He gets away, but the terrorist gang is still attacking everyone, including John's family, and holding them hostage in case any cops show up. Soon, John is in a battle with more terrorists, and though he kills them, Hans and his "I want John's blood" member see him trapped in glass and blast it to bits, giving him no choice but to walk on the glass and cut the bottoms of his feet. He manages to get them washed and wrapped, but very soon other police, who he's tried to alert, arrive. Only one believes him, and to make matters worse, the one who wants to kill John bad, who by the way is a VERY BIG MAN and amazingly strong, grabs him. They get into a fight, and when it seems like John's opponent will win, John is resourceful. He gets a weapon and kills his enemy with it. Finally, the cops find out that John was right, and while they gun down the remaining hench men of Hans Gruber, John goes up to a high office to find Gruber himself. Gruber says a few slurred words of insult, and then he shoots another man. He also fights with John all the way down & grabs his wife. He is ready to blow her brains out, but John has a trick up his sleeve which distracts Hans just long enough for John to draw his gun and shoot him. Hans goes hurtling out the window and falls to his demise. John hugs his wife, and he and his family as well as all the people go home for the holidays. This movie is damn near perfect. It has great acting, many cool and/or funny quotes, and this is as good as Bruce Willis gets, as far as I'm concerned. If you like action movies, this is for you.
