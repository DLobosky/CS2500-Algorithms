They have never been abused, just worn, and have never been in water deeper than 10 feet (3.3 meters).  The instructions say not to press the buttons under water and that instruction has been vigilently obeyed, yet they still leak eventually.This one lasted about 8 months, then came out of a pool one day, completely filled with water and non-functional.  To have it repaired/replaced cost $7 plus the cost of shipping the watch to Timex, persuant to the warranty terms.  Two others have started becoming foggy after swimming (pool, not ocean).  The fog evaporates indicating that the water can not only get in, but can get out.  The last is still young (6 months) and is working fine.  The functions are great, but I expect that this one too will leak once the warranty expires.  It is too bad because otherwise they are great watches.Given the cost of these things, and the claim that they are water resistant to 100 meters, they should last longer than they do.  If you do buy this, save your receipt, you will need it for the warranty.
