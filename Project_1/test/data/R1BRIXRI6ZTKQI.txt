Though the 8800gts has been out a couple of years it still surprised my none the less to have such a boost.  I recently built a new rig which is as follows X58SO Motherboard, Core i7 920, 6 gigs of Corsair Dominator Ram and Windows Vista Ultimate 64bit. I started out with my 8800gts at first but there was not much difference in gameplay or performance.  I was still only getting about ten to twenty frames per second in Crysis.  My 3d mark 06 score was still around ten thousand or so.  The price for this card was just right and as it gets lower I plan on getting a second one.My first issue with installation was having to move around a lot of my cables and squeezing the card in.  It took awhile to get it where I wanted but with a little time and patience I got it in there.  The problem being how long the card is and the thickness of it.  Upon my purchase I really didn't think about the width since I was use to the fatness of my 8800gts.  I can imagine fitting a second inside might be an issue since it takes two six pin PCI express connectors for power and that is basically all I have on my 620 watt Corsair power supply.  Other than installation I had no other problems getting it in my case.My next problem was with the catalyst drivers that I could not get to install.  Basically I had to uninstall and reinstall until I got it working which sounds goofy to do but it worked.  I can't even get my drivers updated without doing it the same way since the first time I get an error message and if there is a problem I uninstall and reinstall and everything is fine.  I like nvidia better for updates and I never ever had a problem getting drivers to work.  Overall this card is great and I would say far by my favorite.  It comes clocked at about 850mhz but comes with software to overclock that makes it a little simpler.  I got it up to about 975 running stable without getting to hot and not causing programs to freeze also there is artifacting in certain games when set too high.  As of right now I really just left the settings on normal for now as far as overclocking and have no issue with heat or noise.  If you do overclock you will probably have to crank the fan up manually and usually around forty percent or so it gets loud. I noticed that playing Empire Total War was a disaster when I first installed this card and it simply would not play.  I had a lot of problems with freeze ups and crashing.  I never had this issue with my nvidia card and from research it sounds like it happens to people a lot.  So far as of now with updates to the game and card I can play with only minimal crashes.  With my 8800gts I was getting ten to twenty frames per second in Empire but now I get anywhere from sixteen to fifty which is a fantastic performance boost that really surprised me.  I play Crysis with settings maxed out on very high getting anywhere from fifteen to twenty five frames per second.  Keep in mind this is before any overclocking or anything going on.  My score in 3dmark 06 is somewhere in the fourteen thousand range so I am pretty happy right now since I have not overclocked anything on my computer yet.On a final note if you haven't upgraded your video card for awhile you will be happy with this purchase.  It is great to go back to old games I had problems running and now seeing them run in all their glory.  It really makes me appreciate PC gaming.  If you get this card hopefully you won't have the issues I had with installation.
