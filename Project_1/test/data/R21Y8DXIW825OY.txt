First the book has barely over a 100 pages and the ebook costs $ 11.50, secondly there are typos and slight formatting problems throughout the book. So, I was less then thrilled with price vs. performance.The story itself is a "classical" romance with a liberal sprinkling of drama and sweetness and is a good read for a rainey afternoon.
