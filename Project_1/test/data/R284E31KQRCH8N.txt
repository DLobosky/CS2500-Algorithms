I saw these movies on the WE channel some time ago and was excited to find them on DVD. I know they edit movies for TV so I hoped that the NR rating wasn't bad.  I Loved "At the Midnight Hour", just as I remembered it. "This Matter of Marriage" we still cute, but the last scene in the shower was a bit uncomfortable because it went on for a long time just showing unclothed profiles. What saddened me most, was "Another Woman". I have to say this was my favorite from TV and I was so excited to get it. What a disappointment to find they had added a nude scene on the beach that ruined this movie for me. I will be disguarding this movie from my library and hoping to record it when it comes on TV again.
