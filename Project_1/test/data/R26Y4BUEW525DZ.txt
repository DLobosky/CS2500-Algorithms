Rowling's brain that set this entire super-reality into motion and melded together a huge plot on a massive canvas that goes beyond the known world into an incredible, shocking, frightening, but always entertaining world? It must be what genius is about. As the final coda to this modern-day equivalent of Ulysess, "Deathly Hallows" brings together all the characters we have previously met and draws the action to its bald-faced basics. Good is looking squarely into the eyes of evil. Battles rage, the action rushes forward, amazing tales are told, and everything I've ever liked about this series is magnified times ten as Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek to accomplish the extraordinary mission Dumbledore has bequeathed to Harry. Who is Harry to the reader? Is he not the embodiment of the reader's better self, a nonhero whose spirit of loyalty, humanity, kindness, and love drive him into heroic action? His genuine nature is what we all see ourselves as having. He is the innocent who has been thrust into a complex and duplicitous world of pain and suffering merely by the act of being born. He is also the literary orphan seeking the mythic lost father and mother. His only real family are his friends and his only real home his beloved school. He is a deeply sympathetic figure who speaks to whatever has been lost within ourselves and he symbolizes our yearning and hope to defeat those inexplicable losses. Voldemart: who can really explain his nature? Such an evil character is as old as the Old Testament. He is a fallen angel with amazing powers that only an unlikely but utterly sincere figure can defeat. Voldemart is a figure that embodies our terror of death and our drive at any moral cost to conquer death and achieve immortality.  "Deathly Hallows" brings out the best of J.K. Rowling's writing style. I was surprised a number of times here by her good prose, as I've grown used to her straight-ahead action-driven writing that generally is flat and simple. The action has always been what the language has been about, not brilliant metaphors or stirring feats of linguistic art. Surely she is no Homer or James Joyce. But she possesses the visionary imagination of a genius. As I began, so shall I end. Harry Potter is a wonder, a world unto itself, well worth entering.
