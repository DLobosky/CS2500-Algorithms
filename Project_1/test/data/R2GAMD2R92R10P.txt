Mystery is the dominant element in each book, but the romance between Julia Grey and Nicholas Brisbane is the backbone to the trilogy. The slow, methodical development of the mysteries is nicely counterbalanced by the tempestuous relationship that develops between Julia and Brisbane. The writing is elegant and rich, very immersive.SILENT IN THE GRAVE introduces us to our heroine, Lady Julia Grey, and begins with her husband's murder. As the winning first line of the novel tells us: "To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor." Julia had been quiet, obedient, and dull all her life - widowhood is the making of her.  Her bold, warm nature flourishes as she embraces her independence.When Julia realizes her husband was murdered, more than a year after he died, she is determined to find the killer - no matter how cold the trail. To succeed, she needs the help of Nicholas Brisbane, the private investigator her late husband hired before his death to investigate a series of ominous threats.  Brisbane is the kind of dark, dangerous hero who's as abrasive as he is seductive.  I occasionally found him difficult to like - while helplessly turning pages, anxious to find out what he'd say or do next.  I devoured the whole trilogy. The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell. The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children. Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, there were plenty of details I couldn't guess and had to read on to discover.I started the trilogy expecting something along the lines of Dorothy Sayers, but the homage was really towards the Bronte sisters, Gothic mysteries, and maybe a dash of Sherlock Holmes. All in all, highly recommended.
