One flip-flop of the Ocean style in red and black broke at the thong part and I had to repair the sandal with Super Glue and part of a scrubbing sponge - not sure how long my repair job will work.  The massage beads are larger and harder and positioned differently and the arch support is more elevated, so they take more getting used to and may be too much of a good thing (reflexology) for some. The thong and side parts of the Ocean sandal are attached at the bottom of the shoe. I can't recommend the Ocean style over this Classic style flip-flop.  The Classic style wins hands down for construction, comfort and footbed design - not to mention price. (Ocean style retails for $14.99)I am hoping that these Classic flip-flops will last for a while due to the uni-body construction.  These sandals are available at CVS for $12.99 regular price and often on sale.The Classic flip-flops are extremely comfortable and a good choice for those individuals who can't tolerate a flat "Old Navy" style flip-flop with no support.  These have gentle arch support, massage beads, a contoured footbed and elevated toe rest area.These flip-flops fit perfectly with the Futuro compression ankle support (Comfort Lift) that I need to wear right now due to slow recovery from an ankle and knee injury. It's great to know that these flip-flops are a good alternative as therapeutic footwear for hot summer days.Important Update:  I may have confused these with the Maui style.  If they are not the same, then this review actually refers to Maui style - sorry for any confusion.
