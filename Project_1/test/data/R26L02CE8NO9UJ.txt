However, I have looked long and far for something just like this one.  Here is what I like in a light:1.  Powered by traditional batteries.  Yes, it's true that the (much) more expensive lithium cr123a batteries pack more punch, and have a longer shelf life, but the cost is ridiculous.  I use this light a lot - hours each day.  I want a light that is powered by easy to find and inexpensive batteries, or even better, easily found rechargeables.  I use Sanyo Eneloop batteries.  Very very good.2.  Small size.  I carry this around with me much of the time at work, and need something I can have on my belt, or back pocket.  This one is a great size.  It's a little heavy, but that is due to the amazingly thick body.  It is seriously beefy.3.  Tactical switch.  I like it.  That's all.  I prefer the button on the back, and this one feels great.  It's rubber, and have a nice solid feel.  Click it once for on, press it lightly to toggle between high and low, and click it again to turn it off.  It defaults to the high setting when first turned on, which is good.  You DO NOT need to cycle through high and low to turn it off.4.  Intensity.  I challenge you to find another light this bright (220 lumens) powered by AA batteries.  This thing is truly amazing.I purchased my first one at a local AC/Heating supply house while working part time in that industry.  It was almost $50, but looked like a nice light, and I was not disappointed.  It has taken lots of abuse, and seems no worse for the wear, except for the corners getting warn of its anodized coating.I liked it so much, that I tell everyone about it.  Recently, I found a need for a second one, and found it here for little more than $30.  What a great buy.I have had my original for about 2 years and have had no issues.  It really is as good as it sounds: 2 AA batteries producing 220 lumens of intense light.  Highly recommended.
