I was worried that this would be sticky, greasy or difficult to apply. This is smooth, moisturizing and super easy to apply. A little bit goes a long way. I tried applying it straight from the stick and I put too much on. It is easiest to apply with a make-up sponge or your fingers. Not only will it keep the stick clean, but you will have better control of the application. The color is beautiful over pale to medium skin. Tarte no longer makes this color, so snatch it up while you can. For the price, can't beat it! The most important thing to me are the ingredients. Tarte makes safer cosmetics.
