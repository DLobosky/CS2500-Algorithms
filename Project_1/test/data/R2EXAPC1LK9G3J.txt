Being a Catholic homeschooling mother of young children who normally do not watch TV, I am pretty picky about the movies I let our family watch.  I would highly recommend "Mother Teresa" to any traditional Catholic, or anyone for that matter!  I know a little bit about Mother Teresa from reading a biography, and I saw no fatal flaws in the movie as far as from a biographical standpoint, but that is not critical to me. What is critical is that the movie is clean and shows the Church and Saint in a truly Catholic light, and is edifying all around. This film holds to all those standards. It is a wonderful film for a family of children of any age, and is well written and acted to par.  Olivia Hussey makes a perfect Mother Teresa, which I was a bit surprised to see since I have only seen her in Jesus of Nazareth and couldn't picture her as the Mother Teresa that I "knew"!
