The *only* reason it didn't get the 5th star is because the little blue spigot cover comes off completely and it would be better if it was tethered so I didn't have to worry about losing it on a run. Also, there is a straw that come with the cap, so the bottle has to be pointing downward to get a good sip, as opposed to drinking like you would from a soda can. That's not terrible and helps to keep focus while on a run, but the last dregs of water get lost and that's a huge issue when you're rounding mile 10 and every single drop is a blessing. The belt is very secure if you fit it just right to your body. No worries about your water bottle banging on your kidneys for several miles. There are 2 cargo pockets on the belt. Not huge, of course, but perfect for keys, gels or a hankerchief. There is also a pocket for your mp3 player up front. It is very generous and fits and iPhone with a cover in it.The bottle cap has a locking and unlocking machinism so no worries about leaks. Wide open mouth makes it really easy to clean and air out. Can't say enough about it. I really like it and I'm proud to add it to my gear.
