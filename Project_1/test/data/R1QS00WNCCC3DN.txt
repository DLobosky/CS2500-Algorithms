There were times during the movie when I felt I was watching a travel show sponsored by the Japanese tourism board. The "wowing" Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh. Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.To complete the picture, the movie also lets the audience experience the cultural shocks, but in a rather derisive manner to the Japanese: A doctor who keeps speaking Japanese in a totally vain hope that his politeness would make his American listener understand his diagnosis. Even a translator doesn't have enough mastery of English to get a commercial director's message across to her American client. A prostitute could not even properly say the word "rip." On a rare occasion when the movie does not seek to cultural-shock the audience with a language joke, a Japanese teenager is spotted reading a pornographic comic in the public.To be fair, all those depictions are not exaggerated in the movie as they do happen the same way in real-life Japan. But like the exotic photography, the amusement derived from those jokes wears thin. Too thin to warrant their repeated usage in the movie.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance. Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point. Sometimes it seems a mere touch or a lingering stare is what it needs to bring the feelings to the boil.However, the over-reliance on the two actors and the set location renders the movie lacking its core support. This movie is mood-driven, which itself I have no problem with. In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes. With little story, longer scenes would have plunged the movie into boredom. But also because of little story, the short scenes sometimes feel incoherent and they are linked together only by a weak thread of mood. This thread is weak in this movie because the mood is mainly generated by location-specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces. But as I have just mentioned, these things wear thin. If you like mood pieces set in Japan, I'd recommend some really good Japanese made TV series in mid 1990's (e.g., Long Vacation).Although I really like the ending scene - touching without sentimentality, the movie in the end feels empty and in a sense, distant. One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood; one bad thing is the location is relied on much too heavily for the good of the film.
