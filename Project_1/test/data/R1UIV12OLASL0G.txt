Just to make sure I wasn't missing out on anything, I went ahead and installed it to the hard drive of a Lenovo Y410 where the Windows OS had gone south.As to the good points:*Installation was a breeze.  Put the disk in and tell it to install.  Took about 20 minutes total, give or take.*Slick interface.  Really nice main page with bright colors and a minimum of fussiness.  Very close to a Windows interface.*It not only offers you a choice of Gnome or KDE desktops, it also tells you the difference before you make the decision.  This is helpful for newbies to Linux.*It detected my USB printer and camera and downloaded drivers for both. Windows never did this right.*It quickly found wireless hotspots, and it even detected my Ethernet connection without hesitating.*Included library of applications is a rather hefty 3 GB and includes just about everything you could need.*If you can't find an app you want, it will find online repositories for you.*It's quicker than Windows once booted but is no quicker than Windows to boot.*Mainly all of the apps, like OpenOffice are merely free clones of equivalent Windows based programs.  This is good because one interfaces with the other without too many problems.  You even get a free clone of Adobe Acrobat which costs close to $400 for Windows.*Virus problems?  What virus problems?  Very few are written for Linux so that worry is not something you have to fret over.*Updating was a breeze although I did find it rather disconcerting that it required several hundred megabytes of updates.  This indicates a not so ready for prime time release.Now for the bad:*I got my distro from a Linux magazine that includes disks, but if you want to buy a disk it will set you back roughly $70 or so.  Fact is, plenty of online sources will sell you a disk for $9 or less or you can just download it and burn an ISO disk.  Amazon.com usually have variations at a good price.*The Firefox browser included is dreadfully slow because the DNS check has been enabled (supposed to offer greater security against phishing and bad websites, but it's awfully poky).  I had to do a quick Net check to find out how to disable the DNS (enter about:config in the URL area and scroll down and disable DNS).  This is common to all new Linux distros that use Firefox and is not indicative of a Mandriva problem.*Once you do get to the repositories and available apps, some of the descriptions are bizarre and can be confusing.  Want to upgrade you whooiz and whatchayoumaycallit?  I don't know for sure, but you'll find something there along those lines.  Be careful what you download, it may jam something up.  Again, this is common for most Linux systems.*Typical of Linux, there is still no standard for sound cards.  The Linux Standard Architecture would not recognize my Soundblaster card and I had a devil of time getting it to work.  I finally installed a USB sound device which it recognized right off the mark, but this required I use headphones.  My onboard speaker system never worked.*Unless you download a special app, you can forget playing DVDs.  Due to copyright constraints it ain't happening anytime soon.  Secondary apps do exist to play DVDs but there is no guarantee that they will work with Suse completely.  Once I did get the DVD to work the playback was horribly choppy and erratic.While it may seem the bad points outweigh the good, it's a matter of perspective.  Linux always has had some bug issues but so does Windows or Apple OS.  Linux suffers because it's an free OS (most can be downloaded for free but they do charge to mail you disks) and the Big Boys don't like the Free Guy knocking on their doors. Fact is, Mandriva 2008 is a slick OS that ranks at the top with Suse being a close second and Freespire being third.
