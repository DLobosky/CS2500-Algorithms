Summary:Great movie for kids and adults with lovable characters and side splitting laughter. Great Pixar quality animation, great and imaginative script, great acting voices (Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully) that really fit their parts, high quality comedy (some slapstick) great directing, great music.Review:This hilarious movie delivers side-splitting laughter!  Everything fits together and is just great! Should be animated movie of the year!Story:Monsters work for a Corporation (Monsters, Inc.) That supplies energy for their city, Monsteropolis, by capturing the screams (scream energy) of children and monsters compete for the best screams with blue-furred cuddly Sully (Goodman) leading the competition.  Somehow, a charming infant sneaks into Monsteropolis and hooks onto Sully; and whoever gets caught with her will get "cleaned" by the "authorities" - not a good thing! This throws Sully and one-eyed Mike into a panic as they stumble against all odds to send the child back without getting caught.  Scare Factor:While the Monsters may be afraid of the children, there is no need for your kids to be afraid of them.  The movie seems pretty harmless and young children seem to have no problem with the movie concept and scenes.
