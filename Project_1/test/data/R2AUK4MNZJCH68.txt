Some people lose their faith because heaven shows them too little, others because it shows them too much.Think you would want to actually meet an angel? As this film points out, angels always had one wing dipped in blood. For whenever God needed a people, a city, a nation to be chastised- he sent angels to do the killing. The angels in this film, both in terms of quality of acting and special effects are very, very believable.Another thing that sets this film apart is it's theological and metaphysical sophistication. A very good case is made for a second war in heaven. This is because when God bestowed his Grace, his holy spark, unto humans, he raised them up above the angels. Some angels, like Gabriel, just couldn't stand being made second to &quot;a bunch of talking monkeys.&quot;Yet, it is pointed out, that when it comes to slaughter and treachery of the spirit, it is man that excels over any angel. That is why they have come to earth in the flesh- to find the one perfect human Dark Soul that will give them an advantage in their stalemated holy war. I couldn't think of an actor other than Christopher Walken who could have pulled off this role- who could believable be opposed to the forces of heaven and hell. You actually believe that he would burn down heaven to make his point....
