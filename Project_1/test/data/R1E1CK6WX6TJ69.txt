The newest Harry Potter is quite an achievement.  I realize that many will find it less joyful than the earlier books in the collection.  Viewed from the perspective of an adult,  it doesn't seem like a "children's" book ought to be.  What a child thinks on the matter, however, will probably be quite different.Whatever the case, I thought  it quite good.  It's definitely much less for or about  younger children than the earlier ones.  You might almost say that the collection  are a set of "to grow up with books," each to be read at a different stage of a child's life.  They certainly seem to progress in sophistication with respect to the vocabulary, sentence structure, and content from one book to the next. It's amazing really.  I can't decide if the author's style is simply maturing, or if she actually intends the progression.  It seems to me as though she's writing the books for a specific child or group of children , tailoring each to the concerns of a stage of life defined generally by a year of matriculation.  "Sort of a guidebook to growing up."Anyone who has lived with a growing child knows how much they change during a school year.  That toddler concerned with keeping siblings out of "his or her" things is suddenly going to school and facing new challenges.  The next thing you know they're getting married and you're a grandparent-like when did that happen? They soak up information so quickly  that it would put an IBM computer to shame, and their problems are ones that no computer yet built could work out appropriately.  Trying to help them navigate the shoals is a major task for any parent, and it's always nice to find books that help them help their youngsters in an entertaining and attention getting way.The most recent Harry deals with a wide variety of teen problems.  It delves into the moodiness of friends, boy-girl relationships, sibling relationships, "finding" someone, trying not to be "different" or learning to deal with being so,  trying not to be seen as still a "kid" when everyone else is trying to be "grown up," having your best friend "fall" for your sister-of all things-or worrying about falling for your best friend's sister and possibly ruining a long friendship, how friendships change during adolescence as adult roles are assumed, the fact that they will change whether you like it or not, the fact that the world is a hard place that gives little quarter to anyone even the young, that beloved role models can be wrong, that they can die.  Well, you get the drift.  In short, it may be full of magic and mystery, but it's still about "growing up."The book also takes  parents pretty much out of the picture, which I think is the way it really is for teens.  We don't all go to a private school; we certainly aren't all learning the art and lifestyle of a witch or wizard, but we're more subject to  our peers and what they think and expect, and to our teachers control and influence.  We spend more time at school and in after school activities than we do when we are pre-teens.  In short after we hit 13, we're more "out in the world."  On the surface,  Harry Potter is about a young wizard coming of age in a world where magic still exists, but the real theme is becoming an adult.Considering that it's become an international phenomenon, that it is read by "kids" of all ages, and that it deals with real and some very serious issues, I think Rowling deserves a Pulitzer or a Nobel Prize for literature.
