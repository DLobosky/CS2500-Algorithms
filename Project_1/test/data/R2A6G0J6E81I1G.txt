Dr. Ellis has done it again! (I must not be spiteful or digressfrom the contents of this book or I will be breaking the guidelines ofAmazon.com).  So I will just state the truth instead. Ellis has claimed RET for himself and Dr. Beck. Well, it was created by Dr. Low in 1937. Jack Trimpey invented RR as an alternative to alcohol with &quot;The Small Book&quot;.  Using cognitive- behavioral principles. Ellis wrote the intro. Then he coveted RR with this book. If you are an athiest, agnostic, and NOT a falling down drunk, give Jack's book, Rational Recovery, a try. I don't think it was a very kind thing for this man to do. I did read this book.  And it does seem incredibly simple-minded in the extreme. While Jack acknowledges a mid-brian &quot;thirst for the alcoholic which can be talked back to, Ellis is sticking totally to the A-B-C method for alcholism. The examples he gives are really funny. The client states that he had no thought about drinking. Then the RET therapist interrogates the client!  &quot;You must have had some thoughts&quot;. Finally, the client backs down and says &quot;Yes! Yes! Alright!  I did say something to myself I guess.&quot; Therapist: &quot;Like wanting to drink?&quot; &quot;yes, yes, I must have said something to myself when I saw the liquor store! &quot; This is called &quot;therapeutic aggression&quot; where the therapist aggressively forces the client to fit into the therapist's paradighm of the universe. The entire book is loaded with cases like this!Jack's book is much better for people who are not going down the drain. The wording of this book is very bad. As if Ellis wrote it on the subway to one of his singing lectures. If you are a falling down drunk, go to A.A. A Rational-Emotive Therapist told me that she has had &quot;good luck&quot; with her clients going to Alchoholics Anonymous!  And she just thinks the world of Albert Ellis. Yes, I was seeing her for help!
