Published in 2003, Butterflies of North America is authored by Jim P. Brock and Kenn Kaufman.  It is 384 pages.  What makes this field guide distinctive in comparison with other photographic field guides is its utilization of photographs that have been digitally edited in order to facilitate the proper identification of its subjects.  This field guide is set up in a practical manner, because while the text and range maps are situated on the left page, the butterflies are displayed on the right page.  The text that is on the left page provides descriptive information on habitat, behavior, flight season, field marks, comparisons to similar butterflies, and larval foodplants; in addition, the common and scientific names of the butterflies are stated.  Along with the photographs that are displayed on the right page, actual size silhouettes and field mark pointers are included.  For select butterflies, photographs of larvae and pupae are shown, also.  And if the sexes look different, both are photographically represented.  This field guide includes a pictoral table of contents, a section on the identification of butterflies (with corresponding illustrations that point out the parts of a butterfly), a section on finding butterflies, a section dealing with the butterfly's life cycle, a classification and naming of butterflies section, a quick key to the range maps, and three indexes.  These three indexes are an index of larval foodplants--the foodplants' common and scientific names are given--an index of scientific names of butterflies, and an index of common English names of butterflies.  The index that consists of common English names of butterflies can also serve as a life list of the butterflies that you have identified, since there is a box next to each type of butterfly that can be checkmarked.  There is a color key system that is included in order to make it simple to find the correct group of butterflies, too.  This field guide does not stay on the bookshelf whenever I go butterflying.  Butterflies of North America is a productive, excellent, and recommendable field guide.
