They're the standard by which I judge all other groups.Theocracy's previous album, "Mirror of Souls", took me a little while to really warm to.  Many of the songs sounded similar, with a few towards the end all running together.  Eventually though, I grew to appreciate it and it's now one of my favorite albums.  "As The World Bleeds" did not have to grow on me--I loved it from the first play.  It has great diversity and originality combined with killer lyrics.  Even after numerous plays, I can't pick a favorite track; the songs are not all equal, but they are all excellent.I'm not a musician, so there's little insight I can provide in terms of production quality, etc.  However, from an uneducated listener's perspective, it sounds great.  The music instantly grabbed my attention and is quite memorable.  My best description of the style is power, melodic, progressive metal.  Within most songs are changes in speed, sound, mood, and intensity which keeps the album engaging throughout.  There are parts within some songs ("Nailed" for example) which stylistically really don't appeal to me, but these sections tend to be short with the rest of the song being very enjoyable.  The strong progressive influence helps make this a solid album.  The progressive elements are cohesive, adding depth while keeping things interesting and without falling into the trap of aimless, rambling (progressive for the sake of being progressive).  There are no short, cookie cutter songs on "As The World Bleeds".  Each is diverse and gives the listener their money's worth.I have come to expect incredible lyrics from Theocracy.  Matt Smith writes the lyrics for the group and has an amazing talent for it.  There are no copout let's just make it rhyme; the words reflect thought and an attention to detail.  Every song on "As The World Bleeds" has intelligent, deep, and moving lyrics.  Probably the top songs lyrically are "I AM", "Hide in the Fairytale", "The Gift of Music", "Light of the World", and "As the World Bleeds".  The words for the rest of the songs are fantastic as well, but these highlight the quality of the lyrics on this album.  Here's a preview from "I AM" and "Light of the World":  I am your guilty scars, as Roman soldiers tear my back   I am the crimson stain that washes all the souls faded to black  I am the one who bled in silence and endured it all  I am the Word who spoke no word, with a thousand angels waiting for my call--From "I AM"  "You are the light of the world," He said  But we've blown out our candles  And left men for dead  Singing "we are the light of the world, He said"  As the darkness descends on us all  If we were the light of the world today  Would we hide in the shadows  And scare them away?  Are we the light of the world  Or are we failing to answer the call?--From "Light of the World"I may have to wait three years between albums, but it's so worth it.  Theocracy does not slop songs together to get an album out the door.  The effort put into each track is evident from the intelligent lyrics to the diverse music.  I appreciate the time and energy spent to make each song the best it can be.  "As The World Bleeds" is another high quality album from a band using their talents to glorify God in a remarkable way.  Great job!
