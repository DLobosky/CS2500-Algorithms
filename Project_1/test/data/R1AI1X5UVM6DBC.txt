I used it regularly for a few years and then the IH came on the market and I just HAD to have one!I sent this one to my daughter, who uses it almost daily and is extremely pleased with it.  For anyone who cooks rice several times a week, it very soon pays for itself in convenience and getting a perfect rice every time.  (as long as one follows the directions and measures accurately)I have found both this one and the IH to be very versatile and it can cook a lot more than rice.Check out the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook and see just how far you can take it.
