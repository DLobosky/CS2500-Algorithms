I totally love these Logitech Mice.  As other users, I also came from an MX.  I don't have the issues with the changes though, I like them.  I run the scroll-wheel full bore so didn't like it switching on me and the MX cradle was getting a bit finicky to get the mouse placed perfectly to charge.  The cord is an okay solution as I have these dumb little cords for everything.  This Performance Mouse is for me the perfect size for desktop use.  The USB link is TINY like a nice little USB port cover - doesn't stick out to get broken like some mice.  The battery lasts a long time on these.  And the topper, this thing has that LOVELY metal wheel that will spin all day long and scroll to your heart's content.   That is the best mouse feature ever and why I use Logitech Mice exclusively now.  I can't say enough good things about this.
