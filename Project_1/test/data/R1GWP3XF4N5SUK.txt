Hamanaka is making his Pride debut. This fight has some very good action and Schembri shows some of the same great knees that stopped Sakuraba. He constantly pulls guard when he gets into trouble, which is annoying and also stalls the action temporarily. This is a very close fight until the 3rd round, when it truly gets interesting. Anderson "Spider Man" Sliva vs. Daijyu Takase:Silva is making waves in Pride by this time. He is expected to walk through Takase. Takase dedicates the fight to a man who is suffering through a terrible disease and he does far better than is expected of him. Silva looks out of sorts in this fight. Almost the whole fight takes place on the ground and it ends there, also.Alistair Overeem vs. Mike Bencic:This one ends in exciting fashion with a flying strike in the first.Quinton "Rampage" Jackson vs. Mikhail Ilokhine:Mikhail looks stiff coming into this fight, whereas Jackson looks determined and unwaivering, as usual. In this bout, we actually see Jackson lift Mikhail up from the guard and attempt a slam. This is not something I'd ever seen before, but that is the kind of fighter Rampage Jackson is: exciting, very talented and very different. He tries things that other fighters don't even think of. Rampage gets this fight to the feet after spending some time on the ground. Here, he almost ends it, but Mikhail falls through the ropes to escape the barrage. Rampage takes over... He tough-talks Wanderlei Silva after the fight, commenting on Silva's shoving him in the ring after his win over Kevin Randleman. He goes at Silva hard, verbally, which will stir "The Axe Murderer", I'm sure.Emelianenko Fedor vs. Kazuyuki Fujita:This is an exciting fight!!! For the first time, we see Fedor get rocked. How does he handle it? It he a TRUE champion? It is all revealed in this fight. A must-see!Mirko CroCop vs. Heath "Texas Crazy Horse" Herring:This is a great matchup that I was hoping to see for a while. Herring comes out a bit overexcited. CroCop remains calm and eludes Herring's attacks, before beginning to launch his own offense. There are a lot of kicks thrown in this fight and it is a kick to a very specific area of the body that ends up stopping the fight. Awesome striking display. Great fight!Mark "The Hammer" Coleman vs. Don "The Predator" Frye:This is a rematch 7 years in the making. Frye lost to Coleman the first time around. Frye trains for this fight with Frank Shamrock, hoping to get the edge this time. There is a good buildup to this fight - perhaps too much. The fight itself is a slow-paced battle for positioning. The fight doesn't have any distinguishable high points. The man who wins simply does just enough to squeak out the win. Nothing too interesting and I would call it something of a letdown.Great bonus footage, as always. I highly recommend this DVD.
