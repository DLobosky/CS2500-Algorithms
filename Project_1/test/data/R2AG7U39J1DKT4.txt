This is truly an interesting and provocative work, and it is hard to find fault with the accuracy of the scholarship, the seriousness of its  implications both in discrimination and violence, or the dismal findings in  terms of the rampant prejudices and tortured logic that brings people to  the point of committing such violence on gays or lesbians. As the author  contends, there is never an excuse for this kind of gay bashing as is  sometimes a sport of preferences for young toughs. No matter what anyone  believes or holds dear, once the step toward assault is taken, all pretense  of civil society is lost. All this said, and for all the many excellent  qualities making this book a provocative and worthwhile reading experience,  I must admit to having some discomfort with the author's all too frequent  tendency to use the world "homophobia" to generally refer to a plethora of  different ways in which many mainstream citizens have historically  expressed their antipathy and hostility toward the homosexual lifestyle.  While I heartily agree that anyone who engages in active discrimination  against gays or lesbians should face the legal consequences of their  illegal activities, I part company with the author as to whether such acts  are necessarily intrinsically "homophobic", as he maintains. He seems to  define any sort of personal antipathy toward gays or lesbians as  constituting de facto evidence of prejudice, disregarding religious,  philosophical, and ethical considerations as just so much smoke screen.  This, in my view, is a highly inaccurate and ultimately dysfunctional  approach to take in objectively ascertaining what the nature and social  dimensions of homophobia happen to be. Traditionally the term "homophobia"  has been to refer to a specific pathological psychological syndrome in  which the individual's often violent attitudes and behaviors stem from a  repressed fear of what used to be euphemistically referred to as one's own  "latent homosexuality". One use to hear this referred to as "homosexual  panic", in which one assaulted gays because one felt a need to demonstrate  (to oneself) that one was straight.  Phobia is an irrational fear, and  therefore "homophobia" so defined is an irrational fear of gays. Insofar  as this term is used in this way, I agree with much of what the author  says. Yet too often here there seems to be a blurring of what the term  means, and too often it seems to be used as a blanket term to refer to  anyone who has the misfortune to disagree with gay and lesbian ideas and  goals, for anyone who is not in agreement with the currently chic  politically correct notion of what the contemporary social attitudes toward  gays and lesbians should be. I think it is a mistake to use the term  "homophobia" in such a way, not only because it is a patently incorrect use  of the term, but also because it also increases confusion about how to  effectively discriminate among a variety of public attitudes and behaviors,  some of which are indeed pathological, and others which are most certainly  not. I believe it is a mistake to argue that any and all opposition to  gays and lesbians stems from a pathological syndrome, or that anyone  expressing shock and intense dislike for the particulars of the homosexual  political goals is necessarily prejudiced, hateful, or hostile. The truth  is much more complex than that, and it is a convenient subterfuge for gays  to argue that anyone arguing against them is by definition "sick" and  needing re-education. To me, it smacks too much of political rhetoric  disguised as scholarship to put the glossy shine of authenticity on  something that's nothing more than a personal opinion. The truth is that  many who disfavor extension of further legislation or social change to  accommodate gays and lesbians cannot be accurately viewed in such a  reductionistic fashion. The fact that the author does so undercuts his  credibility and the urgent message about gays and prejudice that so  urgently need to be heard.
