STORY: Richard, son of a trader and a simple woodsman, finds himself as part of a prophecy to save the world from the evils of Rahl. With the help of Kahlan (a woman he can't have) and Zedd (his old mentor) these three become the force that must strive to turn the tide of evil washing over the entire world.MY FEEDBACK:1) SETTING - A nice imaginative world separated by the Boundaries and filled with all kinds of dangers. Great monster creations, though some of the escapes the characters make are a little too easy. The ruling class of a queen/princess was nothing new, but the roles of Confessor and Seeker were a nice change of pace and added to the strangness and mystery of the world.One complaint was the Mud People - his psuedo American Indian culture was pretty hokie and I was about to skip forward a bit when the author probably realized the same thing and changed the pace of the story. Whew.2) CHARACTERS: It just seemed a bit too conincidental that Richard is the last of the Seekers and Kahlan is the last of the Confessors and Zedd is the last of the wizards. Also, Zedd was way too cliche (just think of Ben Kenobi's relationship to Luke)Reasons why Richard and Kahlan can't experience their love was a nice and intriguing major conflict in the story. The only character that "grows" in the story is Richard, but there are reasons for that. The entire span of the story  covers less than a year so there aren't major changes to be expected by characters like Kahlan and Zedd who are use to more strange experiences than Richard. A complaint is that the dragon gets corny at the end...especially the way it talks to Richard and has this sudden bond with him. It didn't do it for me.NOTE: When you get to the part where Richard is being tortured you may have the same reaction I did and cringe and want it to end but find it lasts for many pages...there is a reason for it,which is explained and it makes for more foreshadowing of how Richard is going to become something more in future books.3) STORY: I was hooked right off the bat and was surprised when I had read 400 pages and didn't know where the time had gone. The story moves at just the right pace and just when you might get tired of a scene/location/character the author introduces some new interesting magic, monster or situation. I tried reading Dragonbone Chair from Tadd Williams and both times felt like was was sloshing my way through the swamp of names while the mud of details kept trying to pull me down and drowned me. I didn't feel that way with this story. The reading was very easy and so where the names...though Richard hardly seems an appropriate fantasy protagonist name.Yes, the story has some VERY telegraphed plot elements (I totally figured out who Richard's traitor is very, very early on). But I realize this is the first book in a long series and it is necessary to get introductions done, setup the world a bit and have our protagonist grow a bit.OVERALL: There are some sex and torture/violence scenes that I would not recommend for kids or teenagers. It was a nice summer read when you are relaxing by the pool, beach or garden with a cold drink in your hand. When I look at some of the reviews where people slam the book, I have to agree with some of their points and in turn would rate this a 3.5 stars. But, like many, I enjoyed this fast read and I really got caught up in some of the scenes and relationships, which is why at times I rate this a 4.5.
