Some of the robots are kind to humans, others want to destroy them.  They turn into cars and trucks.  They fight.  There's a bunch of inane subplots about a boy and his first car, a forced love story, lawn jokes, a girl and her felonious past, a soldier and his baby girl, a bunch of hackers, and a range of insulting stereotypes that lay the director's thoughts bare: "Oh, you know what's really funny?  Black people!  Acting black!  That's hilarious!"  (This movie is a case study in ridiculous and demeaning stereotypes.)The movie's director, Michael Bay, is one of the worst filmmakers working today, the man who brought us the interminable "Pearl Harbor" and the inexcusably sappy "Armageddon."  I thought even he couldn't totally ruin the potentially campy fun of a movie about giant killer robots from space, though...but he did.This movie's dialogue is so bad, particularly the cheesy sound bites given to the robots themselves, that I would not be surprised if ninety percent of it was made up by the actors on the spot.  Seriously.  The action is more banal and unexciting than the pointless action scenes in the last two Matrix films, the story and characterizations are straight out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and the plot is almost nonexistent and completely nonsensical.  You are basically guaranteed not to care about what happens to any of the characters, and the whole thing feels absolutely eternal.  I almost turned it off more than once.The incredibly self-conscious and expository conversations between the transformers frequently reminded me of the equally bad "Garbage Pail Kids" movie, which was also a misbegotten film based on '80s collectibles.  And then, get this: the robots are from the planet CYBERTRON.  Are you kidding me?  Did a nine-year-old write this?  And I don't care if it is based on the toys, you took liberties elsewhere, take the liberty to make some sense and not sound like a total moron.  Change it.  Also, several scenes are supposed to be set in the Middle East, but it could not be more obvious they were actually filmed in New Mexico, because they have freaking Shiprock in the background; I mean seriously, if you're going to use the American Southwest to double as Qatar, try not to feature one of the region's most recognizable landmarks in it.Criticizing this movie is too easy, though.  The script--there can't be a script--is generally merely simplistic dialogue such as "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!," (my thoughts exactly) or just blatant exposition.  There are sex jokes and soft adult language for the teen crowd and for all those thirty-year-old virgins stuck in their childhood, but no one ever dies or gets hurt and most of the picture seems to be catering to grade schoolers.This is sci-fi at its worst, movies at their lowest, greed and pointlessness at their most rampant.  And it's not even entertaining, really--because I really would forgive a lot of it if it was.  It's tedious.  It's excruciatingly boring at points, almost always unbearably cheesy, never funny, never tense, and it is a total waste of what could have at least been some fun eye-candy. I am being honest with you, when I say, this is a terrible film, very possibly the worst of the year.  Don't watch it.  Don't trust anyone that tells you it's great.  It's "Herbie the Love Bug" meets the Power Rangers meets Michael Bay meets a freaking TOY, and it follows a recipe that nothing good can possibly come from.
