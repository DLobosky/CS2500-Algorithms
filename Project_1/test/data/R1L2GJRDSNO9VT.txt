While it may seem quixotic to add a $70 IR blaster like the Hot Link Pro to a sub-$20 IR remote, our young boy was having difficulty pointing the RCA RCRP05B 5-Device Cable Remote just so at the various components, so I added the Hot Link Pro Remote Control Booster System. This device is basically a far more sensitive IR receiver which can detect the weakest of signals from the RCA (or any IR remote) - bounced off walls to its out of sight location works fine - and then routs the received signal to up to six IR components through an optical fiber cable which is attached over the IR receiver in each component. It works exceptionally well and even activates the fussy Insignia NS-BRDVD3 BluRay/Netflix player correctly (not currently listed by Amazon but recommended if you want BluRay playback and Netflix streaming), so long as you take care to place the Hot Link's sender correctly over the Insignia's receiver. A little experimentation and it's perfect.I use the Hot Link with four devices (TV, Sony receiver, DVD player and AT&T Uverse DVR (Motorola VIP 1225)). I have found you can point the RCA to the wall behind you and it still works! I mounted the Hot Link IR sensor on the back of the TV facing a wall and completely out of sight. There's also a signal confirmation blue diode which flashes to indicate it is receiving input from the remote - handy, especially when deciding on the optimal installation point for the Hot Link's IR receiver.  A blue flash from the confirmation diode confirms that the Hot Link is receiving the signal from your remote. So if the confirmation diode flashes when you use your remote but the component does not respond, that suggests that you have placed the IR transmitter in the wrong location on the component.  Once you have all components reacting appropriately, the confirmation diode can be hidden out of sight unless, that is, you like flashing lights.This is like having RF functionality in an IR device.  So for a total of under $90 if you use the remote referenced above you have the capability of a Harmony remote with their RF converter (selected models only) at far lower cost. While Harmony would have you believe that you just dial up, input your component models and all is sweetness and light, that is far from the case, and you will end up doing just as much manual programming as I had to with the inexpensive RAC RCRP05B if you want to emulate the full functionality of the original remotes which came with your components.  My previous combination was the Harmony Touch Screen 1000 ("push screen" would be a far more accurate description) with their RF converter; the combination of the RCA RCRP05B and the Hot Link Pro is superior for one fifth of the aggregate cost.Suffice it to say I no longer hear "Daddy, something went wrong with the TV"!
