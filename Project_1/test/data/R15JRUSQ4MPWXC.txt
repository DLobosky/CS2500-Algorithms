(2 are in my home and one is at my dad's house)  I was instantly disappointed by the fact that this hub could not supply enough power to run an external, USB-bus-powered, laptop-sized DVD burner, with nothing else attached to the hub. (The cheap $10 7-Port hub I bought on eBay, that this hub replaced, was able to power the DVD burner, and 4 hard drives just fine until it crapped out!) I ended up having to attach that DVD-burner drive directly to one of the USB ports on the back of my computer to get it to work. After that, the D-Link seemed to work fine. UNTIL... After about 6-12 months of use, suddenly the external hard drives I had attached to the hub started randomly autonomously un-mounting, which in one case permanently damaged one of my hard drives! After a long and arduous process of elimination and lots of frustration, I finally figured out that the D-Link 7-port USB hub (DUB-H7) was the source of the problem!  Not long after that, I started having similar problems with BOTH of the other 2 D-Link 7 port hubs!  Devices kept randomly un-mounting, and not just hard drives!  In all 3 cases, USB devices that were attached close to the center of the 7 USB ports are the ones that randomly drop, while devices attached at the ends tend to not have this issue. Considering that I had this same problem on 3 identical D-Link hubs, that were all purchased separately, and all used on different computers, it seems that the odds would indicate that this is a widespread problem.I have since purchased 3 Aluratek 7-Port USB hubs (Aluratek 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub) to replace the D-Link, and it has been smooth sailing ever since (so far... 6 months and no problems yet)! The Aluratek hub supplies much more power than the D-Link did, and I can even attach my external laptop-sized DVD burner to the hub, along with 4 hard drives, an iPod Touch, a printer, and a camera, and they all work fine, simultaneously!Consequently, I would highly recommend buying the Aluratek 7-Port hub instead of this hub. I did a lot of searching before buying the Aluratek, and it seems to be the best 7-port USB hub available on the market right now.Incidentally, the following 2 7-port hubs seem to be the exact same product as the Aluratek, but are sold under different brand names.  Aluratek seems to be the Original Equipment Manufacturer however. (So that's what I'd buy)  Check out the great reviews on all 3 of these devices to get an idea of how well they work:7-Port USB 2.0 Hub, BlackCables Unlimited USB1870 USB 2.0 7-Port Desktop Hub with PowerAmazon's best price is currently on the OEM product sold by Aluratek:Aluratek 7-Port USB 2.0 Hub
