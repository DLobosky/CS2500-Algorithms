The enneagram is a personality typing system; individuals fall into one of nine personality types (reformer, helper, motivator, artist, thinker, loyalist, generalist, leader or peacemaker).  Individuals can predict &amp; analyze their thoughts &amp; behavior based on their personality type.  When I first learned about enneagram, I thought it was some kind of hocus-pocus new-agey alternative fluff, but the typing system has a strong historical grounding and it makes so much sense.  This book is helpful if you're new to the concept of enneagram, or if you're familiar with the enneagram but want to discovery or confirm your type. I would not recommend it if you know your enneagram personality type already and are interested in learning about the type . The book provides a simple 144-question survey somewhat remniscent of those interest tests we all took in high school (would you prefer to play tennis or keep score in a tennis match? conduct research in a lab or sell books?). Each question gives two choices; you must choose one -- sometimes it is tough, but the forced choice leads to an answer. The book is most useful as a typing and diagnostic tool. The descriptions of the nine different personality types are short, barely enough to scratch the surface. Once you know your type, you'll probably want to consult one of Riso's other works to learn more about what the type means.
