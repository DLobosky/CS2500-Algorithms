While not as well know in the MTV mainstream as bands Like Ratt &amp; Motley Crue, Y &amp; T  was more talented and put out better albums than any other metal band of the era (maybe with the exception of early Van Halen).  This is a excellent place to jump start your Y&amp;T collection, 'cause once you hear this you'll be off to grab  &quot;Black Tiger&quot; &amp; &quot;Mean Streak&quot; ASAP.If you love hard rock and metal the way it should be played, get this album and it will not disappoint you.
