I use the "Firm Basics" series along with Leslie Sansone to get started exercising again after being inactive for a while.  This tape is for beginners, and those who find the new "Firm" workouts beyond their capabilties.  A great start to better fitnes.This series is not produced on DVD.  It would be great if it was.
