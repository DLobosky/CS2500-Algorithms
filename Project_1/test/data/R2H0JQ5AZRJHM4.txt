A nuclear holocaust has happened, and the remnants of the survivors have started a new civilization called Chiveis, a medieval-like kingdom that has long-since lost any connection to Christianity. The official religion is a corrupt combination of power, politics, and fear mongering. But things are about to change. This is the setting for Bryan M. Litfin's first novel in the Chiveis Trilogy, The Sword.Teofil, a noble army guardsman, and Anastasia, a beautiful peasant woman, forced into an adventure by an attack by outsiders, come upon an building from the Ancient Civilization (our modern day) and find a holy book inside (only the first two-thirds of the book have survived). In the pages of this book, Teo and Ana encounter a new God, one that differs greatly from the official gods of Chiveis.What follows is a fascinating description of what happens when people encounter the Word of God, the "Sword" of truth. His words cannot be suppressed, and the discussions the characters have about the Bible is absorbing. Some see clearly the truth of the scriptures, while others take a view that this truth is only for a select few and want to use it to gain power. Ultimately, the followers of this new God will be forced to decide what they believe about Him and face the consequences of those beliefs.The story in The Sword is enthralling. Author Bryan M. Litfin explained it as "epic adventure," and this is an apt description. It's much more than that, though. Woven throughout the story is a theology that is very orthodox and quite blatant at times. Some will bristle at this. Others will say it's only fiction. The point is that even in a fictional story, a worldview is communicated. What The Shack was for liberal, anti-authority, open theism, The Sword attempt to be for traditional, orthodox beliefs. I highly doubt this book will be remotely as successful as that book, but I'm glad that people are attempting to write great fiction that communicates a Christian worldview like this. The theology isn't always perfectly embedded in the story, but Litfin does a great job for the most part.The other strength of this book is the attention to detail. This is not a fantastical story. The places are real places in Europe that Litfin researched in detail. Names are changed, but the places are very real and described vividly. The story happens 400 years in the future, but it very well could happen.I was moved by the reactions of the characters to God's truth in His Word. The narrative is moving, and the characters are real. Stories are powerful, and I can't wait to hear the rest of this one.
