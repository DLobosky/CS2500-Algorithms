Not one of my favorite Gaiman outings.... started out feeling like I was reading one of those old "Dick and Jane" books... you know: Jane has brown hair. See Jane run. Jane likes toys.... it got better towards the end, but the writing felt very basic. The story itself was interesting though. I can see why they turned it into a movie. It took all of about 90 minutes to read, so it's quick and cute if you have 90 minutes to kill. But I would prefer to re-read Stardust if given the choice between the two.  There were also a few plot points that left me scratching my head at the end too.  The characters were as colorful as they can be in a "Dick and Jane" sort of way.  It was a little too creepy to for me to feel like this should be in the children's section of my bookstore where I found it.  YA or Fantasy seems more appropriate.  I think kids my end up scared out of their wits reading this.
