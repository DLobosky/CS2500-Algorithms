Today I did the 1st. one and I have to say that she does not waste a minute of the routine, you work hard the whole body, strenght, flexibility and your going to swaet to.

I'll say it is for beginners and intermediates, I'm an intermed. and I had so much fun with it. she tells you how to modified if you are a beginner. I love it!!!!!!!
