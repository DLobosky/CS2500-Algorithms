The characters are exactly the same as in previous books, just with new names (with the exception of the excellent and original Truhls Rohk and Ryer Ord Star). We have the Druid, the highlander, the dwarf, and the reluctant and confused young hero that can't figure out his place. The Druid still finds it necessary to conceal and deceive, and hates himself for it. The heroic brothers (er.. cousins here) promise to take care of each other while you just know something will come between them. And there are plenty of other parallels between this one and past Brooks books. So while this book describes a quest to find some powerful magic from the "Old World", and not a battle with an evil force bent on world domination, the story reads much the same as the previous Shannara works. The majority of the first book, Ilse Witch, is spent introducing the rather large company that goes on the voyage. In fact, so much time was spent in early character development that most of the book felt slow, while the end felt rushed and ill-timed. After spending close to 300 pages assembling the company and describing the huge adventure to undertake, the actual journey and the excitement therein happens in the blink of an eye. Still, the ending is VERY good, and continues on in the next book. [4-stars]Antrax is actually one of my very favorite Shannara books of all. With the character introductions, world-building, and plot set-up mostly taken care of in the first book, Brooks is able to jump right into the excitement here. And that excitement is intense and non-stop throughout the book. Perhaps the most action-packed of any Shannara book, this one is tough to put down.  The same excellent characters continue to develop here as well. Each of the primary characters go through some intense physical and emotional trials, as they fight to complete their purposes or simply to stay alive. The secrets behind the unique and much-loved Truls Rohk continue to be revealed, as well as those behind Ryer Ord Star and the semi-sentient Antrax. Walker, Bek, Rue, Quentin and the Ilse Witch all approach their destinies, and each of their stories are completely captivating. [5-stars]Unfortunately, the third and final book in the trilogy, Morgawr, was somewhat of a let-down.  After the dramatic and twist-filled ANTRAX, this book just seemed slower and predictable.  Nearly everything that happened was fully expected, turning out almost exactly like you just knew it would.  Besides that, all of the characters are going through personal crises, where they doubt themselves and beat themselves up mercilessly for past mistakes/regrets.  I'm sorry, but reading about all of your favorite characters being depressed just doesn't make for an enjoyable experience.  Sadly, this last book in the trilogy was quite a disappointment. [3-stars]Overall, the trilogy fits in nicely with the rest of the Shannara universe, and shouldn't disappoint fans of Brooks.  It also eases you right into the next trilogy, The High Druid of Shannara, which hasn't yet been published in this format.  I do recommend getting VotJS in this version.  Save yourself some money and some shelf space and have a nice-looking and high-quality book.
