These bowls are the perfect size for feeding my cats single-can servings of Innova. (For free feeding kibble and leaving out water, I use the 20 oz. size.) The Durapet bowls are easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. They are unbreakable, stay put on solid-surfaces, and have no smell whatsoever. Why would anyone (as Yang reported) remove the plastic non-skid layer, anyway? My cats enjoy looking at their refection in the water bowl, and these bowls do not give them chin acne.
