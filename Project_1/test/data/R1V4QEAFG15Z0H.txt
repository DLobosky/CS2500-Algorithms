This one covers the fall of Malaya and the Philippines, Coral Sea and Midway. As with the first this is a great book!! Very lucid, easy to follow, grounded in the big picture but still lots of interesting detail. Willmott points out that both the Brits and Americans displayed almost criminally poor judgment reinforcing the Philippines and Singapore with a force they knew at the time would be inadequate to hold it and thus condemned tens of thousands of men to Japanese POW camps.Originally Willmott set out to write a trilogy on WWII in the Pacific, but he found that he needed two volumes just to get through Midway. He would probably have needed another volume just for the Solomons and God only know how many for the rest of the war. It seems that these two books make up two thirds of a projected trilogy, but I can't seem to figure out what the third book is or if it was ever published. Anyway, great read, highly recommended!!
