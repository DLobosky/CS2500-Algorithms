I saw this many years ago and have it on DVD.It is a wonderful,witty,romantic movie with George C. and Joanne and dear,sweet Jack Gilford giving lovely performances.There are scenes which are so gentle and tender,you will get a lump in your throat.If you are not a fan of whimsy,and not a fan of a terrific ensemble acting,then avoid this movie.However,if you love romance and kindness and acceptance,then this is the movie for you.(Actually..anything with Jack Gilford in it automatically ends up in my DVD collection.I loved him in everything he was in.)Give it a try.I think you will be delighted.
