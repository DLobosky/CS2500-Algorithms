Although  you do get an interesting perspective on the ancient Greek culture's odes for athletic champions with occasionally imaginative metaphors, it is a hard slog.The Kindle version is close to worthless; even adjusting the fonts to maximum size, you can barely read it.Combining a difficult and obscure read with minuscule fonts equates to a woefully inadequate reading experience.
