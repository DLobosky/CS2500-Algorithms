GIMP 2.6 for Photographers is well-crafted and there is much to like here:1) The book content sticks to its mission of introducing the software to photographers and serious image editing beginners. Necessary preparatory and background information has not been skipped. The tutorials are paced to move you quickly to comfortably handle the most common editing challenges. 2) The physical book itself is large-format, lying flat for self-study. It is crammed with color illustrations and screen images that complement tutorial text appropriately. This book is actually nice to look at!3) The included DVD contains enough extras to make this book a complete package. You get the GIMP software in its multiple OS versions and all the sample images used in the tutorials. There is also a bunch of related software goodies on the disc that I have not yet had a chance to explore.This book is my own intro to GIMP and I'm glad I got a nice one.
