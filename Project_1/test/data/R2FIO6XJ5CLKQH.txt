I was going to upgrade my Linksys 54G to D-Link N, but to confusing.  If you have a Windows OS, Iguess it would be easier, but I have a Mac system.  I got one computer to work, but my other wirelessdevices, couldn't connect.  A little confusing.  So, I went back to my slow, but faithful Linksys.  MaybeI'll buy a new Linksys N router.I brought a new Links wireless WRT160N from Walmart; sorry Amazon, router and have been trying to get it to work for the last 2 days; but it wouldn't connect, whatever I did. Finally, out of desperation,  I switched over to Firefox and EVERYTHING started working!!!!  My probelm all along had not been the new router or Network preferences, but SAFARI!!!  It was screwing things up.  I would recommend that if you are upgrading to a new 'N' router, stay away from Safari and use Firefox, to access your 192.168.1.1 Linksys page.  Webpages load super fast and everything is allot smoother.  I'm switching over to Firefox.I don't know what it is about Safari, but Linksys wireless router, definitely do not like it.I can't really say if the D-Link router was any good or bad; since I never really got a chance to test it, priorto sending it back.  All along it was Safari browser screwing things up.
