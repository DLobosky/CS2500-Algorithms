Humidifies very unevenly: raises humidity by 25% a few feet away (where the amount of the white dust is maximum), but the humidity almost does not change 7-8 feet away. 3. The fact that it has to stay up on a few feet stand is uncomfortable (otherwise the humidity goes up only in a small area above the ground). 4. The tank is only 1 gallon, does not even last through the long night. 5. Makes loud "water bubbles" noises, which did bother me at night, but you probably get used to them.Finally, mine got broken after a few days: did not shut off automatically the very first night, and then refused to even switch on a few days after it. So I returned it. Since I did not like the features, i ordered instead a more expensive Venta ultrasonic model. That did not work either (also lots of white dust, but spread throughout the whole room, not just locally), even though it was much quieter, humidified the whole room, and lasted for 24 hrs. So if your water is very soft and white dust is not a problem - I'd recommend buying Venta, not Crane, it will do a much better job and will be more comfortable (though it costs $50 or so more). But if your water is hard and you are concerned about white dust (not only because it ends up accumulating on the surfaces, but also because you will be breathing it in, which is probably not healthy at all), ultrasonic technology will not work for you (Venta is top of the line, it also uses some demineralization cartridge which is supposed to reduce white dust, but, at least in Phoenix, does not help at all). I am switching to a more expensive but superior filterless evaporative technology (air washers, Venta and Air O Swiss produce them). We own one Venta air washer, it works perfectly, though it's a bit noisy and pricey. I have ordered Air O Swiss air washer for the second bedroom (it's a bit cheaper than Venta), let's see how it works...
