Season 2 was better, though it still did some "hokey" stuff. Still centered a bit too much around Jack's daughter (did they intentionally write her as a ditz?). Nonetheless, this season upped the ante a bit, and was quite satisfying.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 2 did a much better job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and an added dis of bonus features, including deleted scenes, and featurettes. The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some "intense" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.
