Full-spectrum lights are very helpful in this regard, so I can get "sunlight" even in the middle of the night.The 5500K ALZO bulbs are the closest thing I've found to actual sunlight. My basic test is just to compare the color to natural sunlight through a window on a sunny day. The color these bulbs put out is quite close to that. I've also tried some photographic tests and these bulbs produce the best results of various full-spectrum bulbs I've tried. Many bulbs have a yellow or blue tinge to them (the latter being especially annoying), but these do not!If you're not used to full-spectrum bulbs, you may find the light to look excessively cold and sterile at first. But colors look more vivid and natural once you're used to the pure white from this bulb, and regular bulbs seem a sickly yellow in comparison. I'd recommend giving it a couple weeks to get used to this bulb if you don't like the color at first; it may just grow on you! (I initially only put full-spectrum bulbs in a couple places, such as at my desk, since they did seem "too white," but I've started installing them elsewhere in my house now.)I have both 27W and 45W ALZO bulbs, and the color looks the same between the two. Keep in mind that even the 27W ones are quite long (6.5") and will not fit into many fixtures; the listed dimensions are accurate, so measure accordingly. The size is the one big downside with these bulbs; it'd be nice if ALZO had a smaller 20 - 23W version. These bulbs also seem to buzz more than some CFLs, and I found this to be more the case in certain sockets for some reason (possibly old wiring and not the bulbs.)Note that this is the single-unit version of ALZO 27W Compact Fluorescent - Case of 4 - Daylight Balanced 5500K - Pure White Light. The model numbers differ slightly, but the bulbs look physically identical, and the light output and color were indistinguishable when I put the two side by side. The "Joyous Light" rebranding sounds weird to me too; it's kind of a cheap-sounding name for such an awesome bulb! :) But these are the same good old ALZO bulbs, just with a different name.In short, these are about the best thing you'll find if you need artificial sunlight indoors for whatever reason: sleep problems, mood disorders, photography, or just a preference for pure white light.
