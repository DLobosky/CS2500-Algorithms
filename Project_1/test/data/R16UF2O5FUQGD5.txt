4.5 stars - After a nasty breakup with her boyfriend, high powered lawyer Lys picks the scariest guy she knows to help her retrieve her stuff, the dangerously sexy security expert Kubush Telos who Lys is pretty sure lives on the gray side of the law. Kubush is not much into good deeds but he's been attracted to Lys and sure that smoldering sensuality lurks behind her icy facade, and seeing the fractures in rigid self control he decides to help her, only to discover that the he's unknowingly walked into the middle of something truly dangerous. Kubush is surprised to find, that lurking behind an impressive set of mental blocks Lys, is not the vanilla human she seems and is instead an uncontrolled witch who sees the future and the psycho ex who wants to kill her is actually a Mage who attempts to turn Kubush into a mindless slave - because Kubush is not human either, he's a demon and an enemy to magekind.Free Fall is a reincarnated and expanded version of the little stand alone short, Future Tense. Like its previous incarnation, Free Fall is set in the world of Jewel's My Immortal demon/mage series. Unlike the original story, which offered only a promise of a future romance for Lys and Kubush, the reworked version fulfills that promise and makes time amidst the danger for Lys and Kubush to get down and dirty before the final climactic battle. The added material gives Free Fall a slightly different feel than it's predecessor, but I liked it just as much. Lys's power is still an interesting one and Kubush is still rough and dangerous but more involved since he's wanted Lys all along. I liked the way the Jewel manages to make it feel like there is a real connection between Lys and Kubush by the time the story wraps up.So Free Fall was a great novella length story for those who follow the series, and this time around there is actually enough here for new readers to get a feel for the complicated world of Jewel's series which is dark, intensely sexy and has just a touch of kink (demon's are ony fertile in their alternate form.)
