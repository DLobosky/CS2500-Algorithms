We've recorded several HD videos and taken hundreds of photos and we're not even close to filling this card.  This card is fabulous for vacationers who want to take a lot of photos without having to change out a card.We're going to have to test this card out on a dSLR camera one of these days - gotta wait until we upgrade!  Highly recommended.
