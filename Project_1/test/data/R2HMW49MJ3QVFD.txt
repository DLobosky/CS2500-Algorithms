I decided against another iPod because I dislike how Apple doesn't support older iPod accessories whenever they come out with a new model. So my search began for my first Windows Media Player MP3 device.I looked at multiple devices, including the Creative Zen, Sony Walkmans, and even the Sansa Fuze. All are excellent players and deserving of hard consideration if you want a non-Apple player. The Creatives and Walkman boast a reputation for excellent audio quality out of the box, as well as intuitive GUI's. And the Fuze is a lot of player for not a lot of money. However, I chose the 8gb Clip. The player works perfectly as an exercise companion: it's lightweight, holds quite a few songs, and sports surprising audio depth with the right aftermarket headphones (I bought Koss KE295 noise cancellation earbuds, and they sound wonderful). I decided against the Creative products upon reading that their music-loading software is difficult to use. With the Clip, its either Windows Media Player 11, or even simpler, dragging and dropping through Windows Explorer. The only reason I nixed the Fuze was that I didn't think I'd ever want to watch videos on a portable device (one big point in the Fuze's favor, however, is the port for a MicroSD card, making it a tough choice for me).Anyways, the Clip's GUI is a blue and yellow OLED, and quite bright in low light levels. It's a bit small, but still legible and reasonably attractive. Getting to your music, FM radio, microphone, etc., is easy and intuitive. If you ever get into some weird submenu, simply hit the 'Home' button to return to the main screen. Great feature. The clip on back is removable, and has a strong spring hinge. Clipped to a waistband, it feels like nothing at all, which is great when wearing lightweight exercise shorts. The dedicated volume rocker on the side of the player is quite handy as well.The Sansa Clip can be summed up for me in one word: surprising. The amount of features you get for the price point is quite impressive. The unit seems fairly sturdy overall, BUT this is my second 8gb Clip. I returned the first to the big box store I bought it from when I discovered that both the power and volume buttons on either side of the unit were quite loose and rattled with little motion. Fearing a hardware failure, I got a new one and it seems to be much tighter than the first. I still wonder if my choosing the Clip over the Fuze was a prudent one; if the Clip had expandable memory than there would be no contest. But all in all, this is a fairly inexpensive model that gives you quite a few options to fool around with. Its a solid choice for joggers, bikers, anybody who exercises. And its so small and discreet, it would never be in the way tucked in a pant's pocket for everyday use. Plus the sound quality cannot be overemphasized. Check one out and see what the Clip can do for you.
