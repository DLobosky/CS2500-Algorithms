This is an update to my review of the model 3010 rack.I haven't read all reviews so I may be a bit redundant.  I first ordered the 3010 unit - smaller rack - and was satisfied.  Have just finished putting two of these larger racks together and will order more.  Assembly was easy, if a bit tedious.  All the parts were there and in good condition.  For DVDs only six shelves are usable - I ended up with a lot of extra pieces.  This is not a big problem since I will order more racks and use the extra parts with them to store printer paper, ink cartridges, blank discs, etc.All in all I am very satisfied with these racks.  They do what I wanted and are reasonably priced.  Can't ask for more than that.------------------------------------------------------As an update, I ordered two of these racks Oct. 2010 and bave been so satisfied that I just ordered and set up a third unit. Each has about 210 DVDs without packing them tightly.  I also have a smaller version that I'm using for boxed sets.  I have not anchored them to the wall (solid plaster, not drywall) but by setting the feet to tilt the unit back toward the wall I;m satisfied.  I do not have small children or curious pets.
