It lacks a good story but all in all it was well put together. I know there is a lot of hate towards this movie but for such a low budget I thought it was superbly done! I have no idea why people have to be so hard on this movie.... put the directors in your shoes... it must have been as back-breaking and complex to make as "The Evil Dead (1981)" was! My main concern for this movie is how many movies it rips off!Plot: four friends and a guide go for a little adventure in the quiet solitude that the dense thick woods of Camp Blackwood (A.K.A. Camp "Blood") provides even though they heard of a missing girl in the same area and they were flat-out warned about it and told not to go. But as they settle in for a night's rest they hear screams in which they also ignore but come to find out that there guide has been barbecued in there illogical fire that can engulf in flames by just throwing a match in it! Now the four friends are being stalked by a lunatic and are being picked off one by one.... who can survive the long day of the Camp Blood nightmare!Review: As I said earlier this film rips off many movies mainly being "Friday the 13th Part One" and it even has ghost tales around a camp fire about there being a lunatic in the area just like in "Friday the 13th Part Two"! Another film that really inspired the ending scene for this movie was "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"! It really copied a lot from that ending as seen the killer slices at the girls back with a weapon and the "SPOILER ALERET" killer is hit by a truck and there are two killers that chase after her in the end "END SPOILER"! And what is with the extended nudity scene that inquires no actual sex but just her looking all seductive towards a man that clearly is as dumb as they come! This film was well put together which I had mentioned earlier and it was. But it doesn't make it superbly excellent! It only gives it a little under decent score in my book. This film will be forgotten in 10 more years more than it has already been and that is a crying shame but for films like "Avatar" that will be remembered because of how cool it looked but in my opinion I thought it was stupid! To end this on a good note I will say that although it was on a micro-budget it still did what it set out to do and that is give us something cheesy and entertaining!Acting: The screaming girl played by Jennifer Ritchkoff (and yes I had to look that up because this and Camp Blood 2 were pretty much the only real movies she played in and that makes her not well known) is wicked annoying but she does show how much she is into acting and I can appreciate that... the other actor I'd like to point out is Tim Young (Whom also acted in Scarecrow "2002") who plays Jay the fowl-mouth jerk that his girlfriend (who is played by Betheny Zolt) pretty much only puts up with it because he has money! I wish more was put into this not just acting wise but script wise as well!Gore: a gory impalement with a machete, a body with cheap bloody cuts all over it, a really weak and fake decapitation, a machete sliced into ones head, a bloody eye gouging (but after the eye gouging the eyeballs seem to be intact just with the eyelids shut), some stabbings, and little more! It looked unreal but hey at least they had money for blood and gore!Bottom Line: Director Brad Sykes is a great director and therefore I give him the upmost respect... I do believe that each camp blood movie was better than the one before it and for that I give him even more applause because he directed all three of them! The film wasn't that great or even decent but it was watchable and entertaining/funny and that is hard to do with a script that looks bad and sounds bad. It seemed like Mr. Sykes didn't like where it was going so he added a little humor to help boost the film along! In the end it was a little under decent!Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong violence, language, sexual content, and some nudityIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 2For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2
