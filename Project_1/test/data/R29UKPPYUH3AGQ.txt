I have used a lot of mice including several Microsoft Models and Logitech models (including the Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX). Even considering its low price, I did not like this mouse at all. I will compare this to the Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 since its in the same segment.Logitech V220 as compared to Microsoft Mouse 30001) Its (Logitech V220's) shape does not fit the natural curve of my hand. I have to curve/bend my fingers while operating it which can cause fatigue with prolonged usage - so this mouse is ergonomically bad. I know you can say that it was designed to be small and people's hand sizes vary but I am talking about its shape - it could have been better engineered even while maintaining its size. The similarly sized and priced Microsoft Mouse 3000 is a delight in this respect. Fits like a glove and you hardly feel you are making any effort even after hours of use.2) The feel is cheap and plasticy - not solid. The Microssoft 3000 is much more solid.3) The precision is not as good as expected - the cursor wanders slightly occasionally. The Microsoft 3000 felt better in this regard as well.4) The most annoying thing about this mouse is that when you scroll the wheel it makes a cheap, harsh, rattling, clicky noise. Extremely annoying. Its like a rough jittery ride rather than a smooth glide. The Microsoft mouse is much smoother.5) The click on this mouse does not have the pleasant tactile feedback expected from a good mouse. It makes a harsh click sound rather than a soft, mellow one. The Microsoft Mouse 3000 is one of the best in this regard (even compared to much more expensive Logitech mice). Its a delight to use and worth buying for this reason alone.However, the good thing about this as compared to the Microsoft Mouse 3000 is that it has an on-off switch at its back to switch off the reception (and battery consumption) which is more convenient than the corresponding system in the Microsoft Mouse 3000. In the Microsoft Mouse 3000, one has to unplug the dongle from the computer and snap it in the provided groove at the back of the mouse to switch off the reception for saving battery.Once in a while a product comes along that is embraced unanimously for its true genius rather than persuasive marketing -  these creations stand the test of time and become what we call 'Classics'. The Microsoft Mouse 3000, is one such classic despite the fact that its the most rudimentary wireless pointing device sans any bells and whistles. After trying scores of mice even up to the most expensive, I have returned to the Microsoft Mice 3000 time and again. Its the best designed mouse I have ever used as far as ergonomics, comfort and usage experience go. Though I am desperately on the lookout for a new mouse to switch to (since I am bored of using the Microsoft Mouse 3000 years on end) which is technologically more up-to-date than the Microsoft Mouse 3000, I have not found any yet to replace this evergreen delight. It will be great if you have any suggestions for me on any new model.Update: I have recently upgraded from the Microsoft Mouse 3000 to the Logitech Wireless Mouse M305 and I like it a lot. It fulfills most of the requirements that I wished for in the upgrade that I was looking for and that I mentioned earlier in this review.
