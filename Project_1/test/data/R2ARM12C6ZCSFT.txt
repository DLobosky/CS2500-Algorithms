Oldest brother Britt is trying to help his more hot-headed younger siblings keep the peace, but it doesn't work very well when they are taunted in a saloon in Kansas, and end up killing a soldier. On the run from the law, they assume new names and by happenstance are soon working on the Santa Fe railroad on it's march west to build the Transcontinental Railroad. Britt finds a sympathetic friend in an ex-Union officer he had fought against, Dave Baxter (Warner Anderson) and soon becomes his right-hand man, acting as a troubleshooter against Indians, drink and gambling that threaten to slow down the progress of the railroad, which is on a race against time to get to the Kansas-Colorado border. His brothers, unfortunately, end up siding against him, working for the scheming Cole Sanders (Roy Roberts) running gambling tables - and eventually taking to more dangerous pursuits. This 1951 production from Scott's friend and frequent collaborator Harry Joe Brown bears some surface resemblance to DeMille's Union Pacific of a dozen years earlier - Scott's job is much the same as Joel McCrea's in that film, and there's a romantic rivalry between Scott and his boss over Judith Chandler (Janis Carter) that occupies a bit of time, though Carter never comes close to having a dominant role the way Barbara Stanwyck did in the earlier film. It's not the grand big-budget spectacular that the earlier film was, but it's also no better written or better directed, and ultimately it's probably the weakest of Scott's 50s films that I've seen thus far. A lot of the problem lies in the motivations of the three younger Canfields, which never seem terribly realistic and tend to shift around wherever the screenplay demands, whether they make sense or not. Add to this some pretty dull dialogue, particularly when Britt is trying to convince his brothers to get on the right path, or the several moments of chest-thumping "this will make America great", and you have a relatively dull and obvious storyline, with a resolution that ought to come off as serious and tragic but instead is played for action at the expense of Britt's real losses. But in the end, it's still worth seeing for Scott fans; he's quite good in it, and the comic relief provided by Olin Howland and Billy House as the two train engineers - one of whom is a secret card sharp - is better integrated than such stuff often is and really is pretty entertaining. There's pretty solid Technicolor photography by Charles Lawton Jr, and the location work is nice.  Director Irving Pichel had worked with Scott once before, on 1936's She; like most Hollywood directors of the period he worked on a variety of genres but seemed to have a particular flair for the fantastic - the film he made just before this one was the first serious big-budget American science fiction film, DESTINATION MOON.  I believe this was his only western, and he doesn't show any particular affinity for the genre's dusty, trailworn feel.  Again, even a weak Scott western is still worth a look I think, and this is no exception, though I doubt I'll be giving it as many rewatches as most.  The DVD isn't one of Sony's best-looking in their Randolph Scott series but it's serviceable; no extras apart from English and Japanese subtitles.
