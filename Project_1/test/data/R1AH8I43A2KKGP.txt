Although I never completed the degree, I have most of a baccalaureate in geology.  Since paleontology and earth history were my main interests, the title Two-Mile Time Machine: Ice Cores, Abrupt Climate Change, and Our Future by Richard B. Alley naturally caught my eye.  The book is an excellent exposition on the recent data collection from ice cores obtained from the more stable portions of the Greenland ice sheet.  I had come across this data source before while on a geologic field trip on Santorini helping with research on the volcanic activity that occured there during the Minoan period.  It had been information from this source that had helped to date the volcanic event, so I was particularly interested in learning more about how it was obtained and about its reliability.In part two of the text, the author lucidly describes the rationale behind the selection of ice and of Greenland as an "archival" source.  He discusses the methods in and problems of obtaining and preserving the material intact and uncontaminated and the methods of analysis that produced the data.   Throughout the following chapters, he lays out for the reader the thinking that went into its interpretation and how this information can be used as a paradigm with which future outcomes of climate change might  be predicted.  Because Alley, a professor of geoscience at Penn State, took an actual part in all of these proceedings and is an active scientist himself, he is well positioned to give an informative account of the topic.  He also has a readable writing style which many such individuals do not.Although I felt that his attempt to "get down to" the level of his non-technical audience was sometimes a little patronizing, I did think that his explanations of some of the physical systems was very clear.  The description of the events leading to and during the Younger Dryas got a little confusing with the comparison to a roller coaster with a bungee jumper and a yo-yo, but by the end of the chapter one still had a fair idea of what he was trying to convey.--I think he was just trying a little too hard.  His explanations of important environmental cycles with which I was already familiar--like those of the carbon, the water, the heat distribution, the oceanic and lake water overturn, and atmospheric cycles and those of the Coriolis and Milankovich effects--were very clear.  In fact they were clearer than some textbook descriptions I've read.  Although I had read of the effects of fresh water on the North Atlantic "conveyor belt" and its subsequent effect on global climate, I had not encountered the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle or the  Heinrich-Bond oscillations in my reading in the past.  The author's presentation was therefore of interest to me.For most readers, part five will probably be of greatest interest.  Here the author puts what is known or suspected of climatic mechanics to work in predicting possible impacts of human activity on global climate and the world's population.  Here too he points out the nature of the scientific method and its limitations.  He is quite clear that some of what he states in his final analysis with respect to the future is personal opinion and not science.As an earlier reviewer points out, the book is an excellent portrayal of how science works, particularly in the aspects of framing a problem and a means of approaching it experimentally, and interpreting the data that arises therefrom.  I found it a very entertaining book.
