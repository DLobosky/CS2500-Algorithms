I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about a dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection. An added bonus of this collection is the fact that hardly any of these movies are available on other public domain collections.  Romantic Movie Favorites is a great 9 movie collection. Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Romantic Movie Favorites: Great: Jane Eyre (1971)Good: Arch of Triumph (1985)Lady Hamilton (1969)Promise of Love (1980)The Last of the Belles (1974)Average: The Gamble (1988)Lady and the Highwayman (1989)Bad:  Hazards of the Heart (1987)The Right-Hand Man (1987)
