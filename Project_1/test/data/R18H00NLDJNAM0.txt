Piece of Mind is probably the most controversial of the classic Maiden albums, with seemingly equal parts claiming it's overrated or underrated.  It's not with out its flaws, but I suppose I belong in the `underrated' faction, and it's probably my second favorite Maiden album, behind Number of the Beast.(though Seventh Son and Dance of Death come very close)This is the album where the classic line-up solidified, with the addition of Nicko on the drums.  Clive was good, but I think this is a noticeable step up, as Nicko is bit more varied and grooves better, imo.  Although he's good, Nicko is relative weak point when compared to the rest of the band.  Dickinson's vocals pretty much define classic metal, and not with out good reason.  A bit over the top on sometimes, but I, for one, like a little bit of cheese with my Iron Maiden, every once in a while. Smith and Murray are legends as well, and prove why they are just about the best guitar duo in metal.  They have some of their most tasty leads of all here, particularly the solos on Flight of Icarus and the little licks they use in To Tame a Land.  When it comes to melodic guitar in metal, no one else comes close.  Harris is the backbone, as always, and gives the songs the surging energy they need.This album is a bit unusual, in that it contains both some their very best material, but isn't as consistent as most of their other albums from the Golden Age. (though this is partially because the better material is so very good.)  The best material dominates, however, and it's got the mix of moods and styles which the next couple albums can't quite match.  The song everyone talks about as being utter filler is Quest for Fire, and I agree.  The middle break is decent, but the verse riffs are real boring, and the vocals are grating all throughout. It's pretty much worthless, but I like everything else.  Lots of people dump on Sun and Steel as well, but I've grown to really like it.  It's certainly not the best thing on here, and it's a bit underwritten, but the chorus is really catchy and I like the whole mood of the song.  The solo is totally worthless, and the whole middle break is of no note, but it has a very solid core.  Those things aside, this album has some utter classics.  The Flight of Icarus is definitely one of my top 3 Maiden songs.  Their best chorus ever, along with probably my favorite lead break of theirs. It's very well constructed as well, with a nice buildup through the verses.  The Trooper is probably the definitive IM song, in my book.  It's got that classic galloping bass with some more stellar lead work and an absolutely first-rate performance from Dickinson.  To Tame a Land is a bit underrated, and another classic.  Tons of atmosphere and great groove combined with some of their best guitar licks ever.The rest of the album isn't as good as that stuff, but it's all worth listening to, and has got good variety.  Where Eagles Dare is a good opener, albeit not their best one, and is a bit more deliberate than a lot of their opening tracks.  Die With Your Boots on is another solid and varied rocker which is somewhat marred but the obnoxious overuse of the titular line and a weak pre-chorus.  Revelations is one of their best ballad type songs. Very nicely paced and constructed, with another instantly memorable chorus.  Still Life is one of their more unique songs which gives this album its distinctive feel.  It's quite quiet and moody throughout much of it, and is pretty creepy.  Another underrated track.All in all, this album has a few weak points, but the classics carry the day. Check it out, unless you don't have any Iron Maiden, in which case you ought to get Number of the Beast first.
