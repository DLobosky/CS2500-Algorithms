Its goal--like that of "Chess Notes" in general--is, first, to discover and investigate new (or forgotten) facts about chess history, and, second, to explode old fables circulating as "facts". There is no way to fairly review all of the material in the book, but a few examples will give the idea: 1). In the "Games" section, Winter presents many dozens of unknown games by famous masters--and also investigates in detail what is possibly the most famous game of all time (Morphy vs. the Duke and Count), noting that much of what is written about that game in various books has no basis in fact. 2). The "Biography" section contains much information on lesser-known or unjustly forgotten players (such as Gossip and Mary Rudge) and investigation of lesser-known aspects of famous players' life (such as Blackburne's feats as a problemist). But it also investigates and disproves fables (not to say libels) about famous players, such as the claim that Alekhine "smashed the furniture" after losing a game, or Sultan Khan being "completely illiterate". 3). The "Quotes" section--perhaps the area of chess history where fable is the most prevelant--Winter gives us forgotten genuine quotes about chess which are deserve to be remembered for being either especially insightful or spectacularly awful. But he also investigates the origins of oft-quoted chess cliches ("The threat is stronger than the execution"; "Chess is vanity"; etc.), finding that, in many cases, the master to whom the quote is usually attributed probably never said it.Of course these are just examples--the book contains, literally, hundreds of items on every aspect of chess history, all throroughly researched. So what? One could say. Why replace the amusing tall tales with dour, boring truths? But the book's real strength is that truth, in chess, is often stranger than fiction. The true biographies, games, histories, quotes, and incidents from players' lives and famous tournaments, are more often than not FAR more interesting and amusing, than the ersatz "Morphy once said", "Alekhine once did", "Steinitz once played" 'history' presented to us in one potboiler after another. If one has any interest in chess history at all, one should get this book (and for that matter, Winter's previous ones). Not only will you be educated about chess history, you will also be greatly entertained. It is a rare book indeed that manages to do both well, and an even rarer one that can amuse and entertain so well without sacrifising anything in accuracy and thoroughness.
