This is one of the most important purchases to make for your system, so choosing the center speaker should be done with caution. I chose this based on my other speaker configurations. Since I have a 7.1 system, I have speakers in the ceiling and the best I could find were Polks. So from there, I branched out to the center, front and sub. All Polk. Polk states that their speakers work together and let me tell you, yes they do!I am very happy with this center speaker. It IS large, so it was awkward at first. I ended up putting it on a shelf above the TV but that did not have a negative impact on the audio. The surround sounds great. The price is right on this speaker so I highly recommend it.
