As a city mayor - as much as in real life - I always seem to be a few bucks above bankruptcy, scrounging up just enough money to make the next improvement to life.Tropico started off no differently then the others, spare a somewhat-confusing control interface (push forward to zoom out??)  After taking in the lush graphics and environments, I started plunking down buildings like a kid with way too much Monopoly money...But things got rocky, quickly...  Before long my umemployment was spiraling out of control, and my expenses quickly took me into debt beyond where I could build new buildings to create new jobs.  This resulted in stalemate, and a "mission restart."  The second time through, I built less of what the game suggested I build (tenements, or ultra-low income housing) and built apartments, which cost residents a little more to live in, but holds less people.  Before long I was making a fortune.  Then I built a mine and started digging ore from the Earth.  Before long I was making more money than I knew what to do with.  Then - as quickly as things picked up - they plummeted.  Mine production stopped.  Income from exports dropped to near-zero.  Why?  I honestly have no idea...  Market values hadn't changed, there was still ore available (according to the layouts screen,) and the building was fully staffed.  In the meantime, several buildings that I had placed were not being built.  My construction offices were fully staffed, but their list of current projects was blank.  Blank!  I had 7 buildings cued up!  By then my townsfolk were rioting and going nuts, and I couldn't do anything to solve the problem...This is how things progress in Tropico.  You'll have hours of profitable success, watching your little Tropical paradise swarm with activity.  Then - seemingly a moment later - you'll be completely broke, staring at the screen in amazement asking yourself "how the heck did this happen?"  Furthermore, gathering information in Tropico is nearly impossible.  At the onset, you'll get tips from little windows that pop up, telling you of problems.  You'll also get help - if you can call it that - from the extremely annoying radio station DJ (even though you may never build an actual Radio Station...)  After the first hour-or-so however, the tips and clues come much less frequently.  As it is, the only tips you'll receive might be along the lines of "your citizens want this" or "to make this building functional, you must hire a professional immigrant to come to your city."  When things start to fall apart however, there is no concrete way to find out why.  In addition, a lot of the information available is unclear to all but real-life economists.  What is Economic Disparity?  I have no idea...  Is a high or low value desirable?  I have no idea...  Does the game explain any of this to you?  Heavens no...And so you struggle.  You try to do things different, but all this does is change the intervals at which everything goes to hell.  Sometimes you recover; if you've already laid down the buildings that you needed, they'll eventually be built, and things might pick back up.  Or sometimes it'll take multiple months of watching ships take thousands of dollars of exports from your city until the money finally shows up in the bank.  Why?  Again - I don't know...  Either the simulation is so advanced that tiny little changes can spiral life for your citizens into chaos, or - quite simply - it's just plain broken.In the end, Tropico 3 is a beautiful game that just leaves you feeling like you really have no idea what's going on.  Through several campaign missions, I sat staring at the screen, 50+ thousand dollars in debt, until I was suddenly notified that I had SUCCEEDED the mission because I achieved some number of something-or-other.  All I could think was, "Well, good thing I don't have to do THAT again..."I rented it, I sent it back, and I won't be comin' around for more.
