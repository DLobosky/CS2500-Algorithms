This game is a great addition to the Leapster Explorer, my five year old son loves it.  This is the only game he has had in his Explorer for a week now.  He has a lot of fun playing it and has learned so much about so many different countries and cultures around the world.  He is also learning a lot about maps, oceans, continents,etc.  I am very happy with this game.
