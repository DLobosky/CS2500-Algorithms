Your children will smile as they read along with you. "Frog and Toad All Year" captures the joy of every season, from a Midwestern point of view, complete with ice cream, snow, sledding and Christmas, and a deep desire for Spring (important if you are a frog or a toad).Somehow, Arnold Lobel has discovered a gentle yet honest way of presenting two childhood friends. They've got a warmth that is similar to Bert and Ernie, like loving brothers.Lobel drew some great pictures too. Like E. H. Shepard's Winnie-the-Pooh art, the drawings are integral to the fun. There is a European classic-ness to them, and to the diction of the story.I fully recommend this, and all of Lobel's books.Anthony Trendl http://anthonytrendl.com
