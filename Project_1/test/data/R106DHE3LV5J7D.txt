It seems less necessary to reinforce the anxiety--fans of the book would term it curiosity--of those baby animals as they ask again and again, "Do you love me?" My concern is that children will assume they, too, must continually ask this of their parents, when in fact it should be hard-wired and understood at the most basic level.This is an unusual board book. It is both large format (7 by 6 inches) and also quite long (30 pages). The drawings of the animals and nature are finely rendered, not so much for the humans at the very end.Ultimately, I prefer Guess How Much I Love You, though that is not without its detractors, either.
