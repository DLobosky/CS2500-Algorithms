As a book lover, I know how important a book can be to a reader. Some books possess powers that change who we are. I think one of the reasons that I am who I am is because of all the books I've read. My thirst for knowledge is never-ending and I honestly feel like books are my friends. They have seen me through thick and thin and anytime I need them, they are there. I can't tell you how many times I've read a book and felt transformed when I finished. I like to keep track of the books I've read so that when I'm going through something, I can read a book that is sure to cheer me up.  I love this thing!
