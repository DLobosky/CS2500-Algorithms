The picture above is misleading if you want to by the smaller size - for a more accurate picture of the small size you should go to the company site. They really should carry the large size too (which goes up to 4 years of age - depending on your child's size, of course) at BBRUS.I purchased the LARGE Protect-a-Bub Snuggle Bub Stroller insert in navy from the company site. This is the best stroller insert for cold weather I have ever tried (even better than the Bundle Me Big and One Step Ahead Toddler Snuggly). It is made from natural lamb's wool (so it "breathes"), machine washable (air dry), and very roomy so it will last a long time. The cost is more (~$80.00), but considering the quality and the larger size/usage time (in comparison to other toddler sugglys), it's definnatey worth it!My daughter stays warm, snug, comfortable,and well insulated -  but never overheated or sweaty - even with a warm jacket & hat on too. The snuggle bub keeps her warmer than any other toddler size warmer I've seen/tried. It can also be tighted with the second set of buttons if needed. This company has great products (dumb name, but great products) & I've loved everyone I've ever tried! I check there site often for new items.
