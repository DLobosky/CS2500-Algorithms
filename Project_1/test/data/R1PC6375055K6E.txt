I bought this in Jan 2010 when it was on sale at a local computer store and was not yet available on Amazon. Turned off "on board sound" in bios (this must be done). Installed board. Power up computer. Put in CD. Run Set up. Plug in speakers (non-powered, will switch to powered later). Using just 2 speakers. DONE!! Worked first time. For a $16 board this is more then I expected. The software controls are top notch for a board this price. Multi band equalizer has user configurations or several custom modes. Room environment has 3 settings. A little adjusting and I'm set. 10 times better then my on board sound. This went in a new computer with Windows 7. I have a custom setting for when listening to mp3's that were recorded too compressed. Works great. More options then I need. If the board does not look like the picture, send it back.
