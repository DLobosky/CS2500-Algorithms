I like Hugh Jackman and most of the movies he's been in, and I would have to say that although it didn't blow my mind, this was a pretty enjoyable movie all in all.  I didn't think the end of the movie was very fair, but at the same time it was still pretty good.  Don't go into this movie expecting a mind blowing experience, but it is still good and worth at least a watch.
