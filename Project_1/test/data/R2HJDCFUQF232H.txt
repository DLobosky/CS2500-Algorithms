The author has the "space opera" genre down pat, along with the technological whiz-bang stuff, but I was taken aback by the ending of the book, where the heroine orders the slaughter of thousands of stone-age natives who have been drugged into homicidal mania by off-worlders with political goals.  Surely thousands of years in the future there will be easier ways to subdue crazies other than wholesale genocide?  Our heroine follows this up by blowing up a starship containing several thousand people. If she'd thought about it for five minutes she would have realized that the starship was on its way to call off a war.  The only purpose of blowing it up is to PREVENT it from calling off the war, so that the heroine can make sure there is a confrontation, again for political aims.  At the conclusion, readers are supposed to embrace this protagonist and be mad as hell about the fact that Haven, the world that produced the blown-up starship, is calling her a mass murderer.  I don't know about the other readers who are giving this book five stars, but I'm in Haven's camp.
