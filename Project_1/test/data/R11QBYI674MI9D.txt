Let me say up front that as far as slim cases go, this is the best I've seen, and I'm a very fussy gadget/case person.  It arrived today and I am blown away.  It is made of quality material, yet is totally form fitting and maintains the aesthetics of the phone.  I was using an Otterbox Defender case which provides solid protection, but I couldn't take the bulk anymore and having my phone turned into a brick.  Here's the deal:PROS:1. Made of quality polycarbonate material, not cheap plastic.2. Fits my Verizon iphone 4 PERFECTLY.  It looks amazing and sleek, to the point where it seems like there's no case on the phone.3. Extremely stylish. The black color looks great and blends in beautifully. 4. Snaps on easily.5. Has a nice soft feel and glides easily in and out of my pocket. I've had it on me all day and the claims that it does not collect lint are accurate.CONS:There's really only one: NOT MUCH PROTECTION.KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BUYING: This is a minimalist case and will not offer much help against damage from drops.  Do not get this case if protection is what you want.  Using this case means you're willing to sacrifice solid protection for extreme style and sleekness.  In my view, this case will prevent cursory scratches and dings to the back and sides of the phone, but will not help with drops (even minor ones).  I respectfully disagree with others who claim this case will help with basic drops.  If you drop the phone with this case, you're screwed unless it lands just the right way.  Also, there's no screen protection.  The sides are flush with the screen (the case doesn't protrude up in front like a bumper case).  I am using mine without any plastic screen protector because the screen is SO nice as is.  Those screen protectors look great at first, but then they start to peel or bubble and look awful.  I am a good phone person and am willing to risk protection to enjoy the beauty of the screen as is, but the choice is yours.Bottom line: This is one of the best slim cases on the market from what I've seen.  Stylish, sleek, well made, and fits perfectly.  Let me emphasize again that using this case means you're willing to risk solid phone protection, but enjoy the benefits of style and sleekness.
