Warning-some spoilers ahead.This is an excellent entry in the series and is right up there with the first two films.It's a huge improvement over parts 4-6,although it seems to throw away the plots of those.Directer Miner  does a fantastic job and this is easily one of his best.The story and  script is above average and the plot is great. Mike's mask is also better  than ever.Chris Durand is pretty good at playing Myers and the acting is  great.The film isn't that gory but is pretty scary.The ending is  decent,though a bit of a disappointment considering that Mike got killed!  Oh well.The film still rocks.Overall,this is a huge improvment over the  last three,but can;t live up to the brilliance of the first two films. I  still highly recommend it.Rated R-contains gory violence and some strong  language.
