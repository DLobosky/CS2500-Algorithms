But I tried it anyway and was surprised to find I liked it, in large part because she really gets you moving and I find I can walk further in a shorter amount of time than I would on my treadmill.  These routines are easy to follow with just a few basic steps - walking, knee lifts, side steps and kicks.  They provide a refreshing change of pace from the more demanding choreography and footwork of some of the other routines in my workout collection (The Firm, Tae Bo, Kathy Smith).  I've been using them to add cardio on weight days.  I like this routine the best of all those I've used so far because of the high energy level and the sense of fun the cast seems to be having.  In the third mile, a "stretchie" is used; I didn't have one, so I substitued the cord from one of my Firm or Richard Simmons toning routines and it worked just fine.  If you don't have either one, don't let it stop you, as it really isn't used that much and that portion of the workout can be done without.      As with her other routines, the mile markers are identified, enabling you to use the workout for a 1, 2 or 3 mile workout.  At 51 minutes, this one is slightly (5 minutes) longer than her 3 mile Super Fat Burner Workout, which is another good workout.  This workout does build to a rather brisk pace, so I would recommend beginners start with less miles or one of the other workouts initially and work your way up.  That said, as Leslie points out repeatedly in all her workouts, you can follow your own comfortable pace and not do the intensifiers until you've built up your stamina and level of fitness.  For those with space limitations, these workouts can be done in a rather small area.  When all is said and done, Leslie doesn't give us many excuses not to get off that sofa and get moving!!
