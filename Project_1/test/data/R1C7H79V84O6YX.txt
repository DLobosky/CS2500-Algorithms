The handle is wooden and will require some extra care: it needs to be rubbed with mineral oil to preserve water-resistance.  I recommend that you don't waste your money on any special food-grade wood-care mineral oil, but rather get a $2 bottle of mineral oil laxative from Target or local pharmacy.My wife and I like these knives very much.
