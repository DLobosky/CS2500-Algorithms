I am re-writing this from 4 stars to 1 star. I bought this one to replace my old Airlink 802.11g router, which I found difficult for video streaming even with a wired connection.PRO:Setup was easy. With the mini CD, it only took me a few minutes.Signal strength and speed was excellent when it was working. The wired connection speed was 100 Mbps, and wireless speed was 53 Mbps, which depends on your adapter. An 802.11g device is up to 55 Mbps (Dynamic). To fully utilize the 300 Mbps rate you would need to have an 802.11n device which I don't have.Range was adequate when it was working. Anywhere in my two story house was four bar.CON:It was very unstable. It was working for a couple of weeks and up and down for the rest of the time during the first month. The customer service was difficult to reach and helpless. I called a few times and couldn't get nobody. Wrote a few emails and no response till I got it fixed for a day, then broke again.I was using it for web surfing, IP phone line and video streaming. No funny stuff.Update on Dec 27, 2011:Two weeks after I received this product, I found the wired connection not as robust and as fast as the wireless connection with this router. I have just had a situation where I couldn't get connected through my wire, even after rebooting my desktop, while all wireless connections were intact. I had to unplug the power to reset the router to re-establish a wired connection. Later at night, I found I had very limited range for the wireless connection: I had to bring my laptop to the router to have enough signal, and even that was not stable. I tried to reach the customer service line, no one was available.Update on Dec 28, 2011:I cleared clutter at least two inches around the router for better signal transmission and ventilation, and removed cordless phones in the room. I also ran the latest firmware update. It started working again.Update on Jan 1, 2012:Lost wireless connection. Can't get it to work. Decided to return it. Feel lucky that it got broken within the first month so that I can easily return it. Thanks for Amazon's customer service.After reading reviews and searching, I decided to give ASUS Black Diamond Dual Band Wireless-N 600 Router (RT-N56U), $123, a try. Wish me good luck.Update on Jan 11, 2012:I got the ASUS Black Diamond Dual Band Wireless-N 600 Router (RT-N56U) installed. It works for a HP Windows 7 64-bit, a Windows Vista netbook, a Mac Book and a SONY VAIO laptop. On VAIO laptop the speed was 115 mbps, but I haven't got a chance to check the Mac (should be about the same). The signal stength was always excellent at 5 bar anywhere in my house, although occationally it was 4 bars. I have yet to find a good use of the dual band. Seems to me most devices are using only the 2.4GHz and not the 5GHz band. But I am pretty sure sooner or later the 5 GHz devices will become more available.
