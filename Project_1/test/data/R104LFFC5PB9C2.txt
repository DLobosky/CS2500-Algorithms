I got this title from Amazon UK for about $35. See last post for link.Hope this helps...Old Revoew:I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin having seen them live in 1977 a year after this film was released. We'll have to wait and see what the final audio on these Discs contain, but if it only has a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, then Led Zep has blown it again IMO. I still own the original VHS, Betamax and DVD versions, and those are stereo, certainly Not the great discrete aggressive surround sound mix I remember hearing in 1976 at the theater. I remember in the theatrical version with the proper speaker set-up Jimmy Page's guitar feedback bouncing back and forth throughout the front and rear speakers along with Robert Plant's vocals on "Dazed And Confused." Totally awesome. That original theatrical mix is one of the "holy grail" Quad/surround mixes from the 1970's and it looks like we're never going to be able to hear it again.
