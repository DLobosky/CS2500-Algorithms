In the transition times (when a size 2 doesn't have the absorbency we need, but a size 3 has too much gap because the kid isn't big enough yet) and after 15months (when we've found that our children's bladders can hold much more...and thus let much more loose in the diaper!), we've found that these are the only brand and type of diapers we can trust. We've also used them for roadtrips when we're not able to be checking diapers as often.
