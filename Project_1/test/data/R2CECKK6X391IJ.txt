And the mystery was more complex.                    *********************spoiler alert********************I like Harper Connelly's character. She is a bit dark. I expect her character to be beyond the norm. Harper has a terrible childhood. Her mother and step father are alcoholics and drug addicts. Her sister is kidnapped and never found. Her family is split apart and she is terribly traumatized. Oh, and she can find the dead. She can "feel" them, know the cause of their death, and see the last few seconds of their life. I enjoy the supernatural aspect and Harper's ability, to connect with the dead. The dead want to be heard and Harper tells the living. They may not always like what they hear.In this book Harper is brought to a graveyard so a college professor can test Harper's abilities in front of his class. He thinks she is a fraud, but he finds she is not. And Harper finds a body that should not be there. She has looked for this young girl before. Now she has found her.What follows is a great mystery. I really enjoyed Xzlda and Manfred. Two new characters that definitely add to the story and make it more interesting. Two real physics too help solve the mystery. I found Manfred as unique as Harper.I do like this series and I am reading the next book. I would recommend this series to a friend. I read all the reviews on this book to date, and a few people get upset about the fact that it is a child that Harper finds. I feel that Charlaine Harris likes to take these uncomfortable problems in our society and write about them to make us think about the victims. She does this in her book A Secret Rage. She writes a mystery about a serial rapist after she was raped. CH also likes to bring racism to light in many of her books because she dislikes it so much. CH can make us uncomfortable sometimes. But if Harper really existed, she would more than likely find the bodies of children. The innocent victims of our society.
