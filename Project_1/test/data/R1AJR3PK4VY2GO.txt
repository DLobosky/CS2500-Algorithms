I love this Peterson Field Guide.  It has great drawings with helpful arrows, good maps and much useful ID info, including behavioral, in the descriptions.  I LOVE the strong, secure, flexible, easy-to-lay flat binding (and the somewhat sturdier cover).  I wish ALL bird field guides were bound like this, many used to be.  My favorite field guide used to be my Golden-Guide to Field ID-Birds of North America (often ridiculed, very outdated).  This Peterson's, which is somewhat similar and easy to use, is one of my two new favorites (I have many guides), maybe just a tad second best to Nat Geo's Field Guide.  But, generally, I use both together.  The only negative is that this guide is larger than the norm and somewhat more heavy.  But, still worth carrying in the field.  A very useful guide for most birders!
