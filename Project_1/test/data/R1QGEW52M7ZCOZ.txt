It is seen on Playhouse Disney in the United States and on CBeebies in Great Britain.In this series, Charlie has a little sister named Lola who is small and very funny. Charlie often helps Lola with her problems and though they have some sibling rivalry at times, they are usually pretty nice with each other. Lola often has an unusual way of seeing things, or can be a bit stubborn, but Charlie helps her to look at things in a new way or to try new things.This DVD features seven stories from the first season of the show --- "I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato" (based on the first C+L book), "We Do Promise Honestly We Can Look After Your Dog," "I Love Going to Granny and Grandpa's, It's Just That...," "I'm Far Too Extremely Busy, "It's a Secret," "I'm Just Not Keen on Spiders" and "I'm Not Feeling Well."The animation is unique and fun to look at. The main theme and background music are all very catchy. The British-accented dialogue and phrases also add a lot to the series."Charlie and Lola" airs full-screen on Playhouse Disney, but it is presented in widescreen on the DVD. Close-captioning is not offered --- there are subtitles instead. The DVD also includes a few bonuses / surprises --- watch for them to pop up while both on the main and episode-selection menus.
