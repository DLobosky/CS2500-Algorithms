This soup is simple, delicious, tummy warming, affordable.  The package makes a half gallon--very rich and tasty.  The package says you can add optional extras like ham or broccoli or corn, but even just adding water, it is tasty, flavorful, and interesting.  Do NOT be tempted to add milk or cream--this is thick and rich tasting with just water.  Two thumbs up from even our picky eaters.
