I use this cable to connect my laptop to my HDTV to stream operas, foreign news programs, and the like to my TV, which is connected to a stereo setup. The transmission is excellent, both video and audio. Another advantage is that the cable is soft and so fits anywhere comfortably. All in all, I cannot see how you can buy a better cable at any price, and the price of this cable is a fraction of what 15' cables sell for in local stores. Highly recommended.
