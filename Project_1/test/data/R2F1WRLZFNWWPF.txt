Owning the book and both DVDs, which constitutes four courses on Taiji Ball Qigong training provides one with a very extensive training resource for learning this lessor known practice found within Chinese Taiji and Qigong.  The training with the Taiji Ball can strengthen the torso, condition the muscles, and teach the practitioner to use the mind to lead Qi.  Additionally, it can enhance one's Pushing Hands ability and is a stimulating and interesting practice to learn.The programs on this DVD contain around three hours of  instruction, and it is easy to navigate to different sections with the menu system when you are learning.  Course Three consists of 16 patterns of stationary and moving Taiji Ball wrap coiling.  These include: vertical wrap coiling forward, vertical wrap coiling backward, horizontal wrap coiling clockwise, and horizontal wrap coiling counterclockwise.  The instruction is performed by Dr. Yang teaching to the camera while inside a studio.  This is the kind of instruction I prefer.  Subtitles are present across the bottom of the screen, though I have no trouble understanding Dr. Yang's English.  Some of the instruction has only Dr. Yang on screen, while most other times he has five students in the studio with him, and he makes points, corrections, etc. as the students perform the movements and patterns.  Course Three is approximately 61 minutes long.Course Four is approximately 112 minutes long, and brings the lessons from the first three courses together with applications, both solo and with a partner.  By following along with the demonstrations and paying attention to the points Dr. Yang makes, a person will be able to add this training into their regular practice.  Sure, it is always better to learn first hand from an instructor, but this is the next best thing for this little known practice.The programs on this DVD are meant to follow those from the first DVD with Courses 1 & 2.  Therefore, I strongly suggest you first learn the patterns from the first two courses before advancing to the courses on this DVD.  All four courses combined with the book Dr. Yang wrote on the same topic will provide you with many hours of learning, training, and practicing.  If you are interested in learning Taiji Ball Qigong, these are the resources to learn from.  I recommend them highly for anyone wanting to incorporate this practice into their training.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the DVD set Hapkido Cane.
