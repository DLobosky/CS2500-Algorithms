No where on the Toucan Map does it show that it is a 2008 map which is more than a little disingenuous so buyer beware definitely applies.I checked with locals and found other maps that were more current for my travels around Costa Rica as I kept discovering problems with the Toucan Map (which does not show the Amistad Bridge on Highway 18 for example which has been in place since 2003). I used two other maps while in Costa Rica and was very glad that I did as they filled in the gaps. Although there are street maps for the largest cities they are often of little use as they stop before the city limits and so when navigating along highways and entering a town one has no idea of how to get through the town to get to where the same highway continues on the other side. Key cities like Grecia, San Carlos, Upala, where this is a problem, are not included on the map and it is in these tiny towns where I needed a map the most to navigate through the town and pick up the highway again. This is where the approach of the Toucan Maps falls down. It covers the city of San Jose and the largest towns and the resort town of Tamarindo (where a map is not needed) or Escazu which for a tourist is important only if you want to see one of the country's best shopping malls. Where a map would be most helpful in getting through towns with more than a main street the Toucan Map is worthless.What I came to find was that unlike the USA and in particular the Monterey California area where I live, it is very easy to get WiFi and an internet connection in even very remote areas. I was inside the Parque Tenorio in seemingly the middle of nowhere and the local soda shop had free Wifi and internet access. I came to rely more and more on Google maps of the surrounding areas where I was heading and using a bluetooth link from my netbook to a tiny and very inexpensive Holux GPS receiver. With Google maps I could also screen capture the satellite images and get current local landmarks which is also extremely helpful in a country where the streets are not marked. The Toucan Map of Costa Rica is good for trip planning, but for traveling around the country I found a combination of GPS, local maps, and asking for directions in the small towns to be necessary to get from one area to the next. I also quickly learned that the locals in a small town often had little to no knowledge of surrounding towns much less one that was 100 kilometers away. I had to ask for the road that would take me to the next nearest town or village, and by so doing learn how to get to the next section of the highway. This is where a basic Spanish speaking capability was a godsend. The new Toucan Map for Costa Rica is due out in May of 2011 but I will not be bothering to buy it. There are much better alternatives for navigating around Costa Rica.This is much less of a concern if you are traveling along Highway 1 or restrict your travels to the common tourist destinations along the Pacific Coast. But the more you travel outside of these areas the more you will want to have a GPS with maps of the country and some conversational Spanish skill.
