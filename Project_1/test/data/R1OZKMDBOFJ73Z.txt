There is a growing feeling that Peter Jackson alone, is the man to be thanked for this masterpiece - and you corporate leeches are just that - leeches on the flesh of the film going public! One day we'll pour salt on you and laugh!I urge everyone to boycott the theatrical release. It is my fervant wish that no one buys it, and that New Line lose millions in lost sales! Everyone, don't forget to tell friends and relatives that might be considering buying the theatrical version for you as a Christmas or Birthday gift - that you don't want it and would rather they spent the money on a "New Line Corporate Leeches Really Suck!" T-shirt instead!
