I think the first season is my favorite season in this series. It is just amazing, it is the perfect blend of action, drama, science fiction and horror, the series have the ability to captivate the audience, it draws you into it's world and make you sit on the edge of your eat glued to the TV.Most of you that read this review have probably already seen the series or at least know what it is about, but if you do not then let me tell you the basic premise of the plot. A plane crashes on an unknown, mysterious island and the few dozen survivors have to try to find a way to make it on the island until they are rescued. Soon strange and paranormal things starts to happen, however this is all presented in a so subtle way that it is hard to know what is really going on. The episodes all belong to one huge storyline that spend the length of the entire series, however each episode also have a theme. The episodes is divided half between life on the island and half between backflashes to the lives of the various characters before the crash, the main character changes with each episode.Lost is a series that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of audiences, allot of it is drama as the survivors form friendships, love affairs and make enemies, but a part of it is also science fiction or horror. When I was trying to describe the show to my fience I told him that Lost played like Survivor meets Call of Cthulhu or to make another comparison along the same lines, it is like Survivor meets The Twilight Zone.Lost have a huge cast of characters and they are all nicely fleshed out, as the season progresses one get to care about these people, they are all flawed but also have redeeming factors just like real people. The actors really do a good job with this one. The picture quality is great and the show is filmed in beautiful locations, the music is pretty good to. Lost moves very slowly and this is both it's strength and it's weakness, you are left wondering through the entire series so this is not a show for you if your are impatient, however if you like your science fiction presented in a leisurely manner with subtle hints and plots withing plots storylines then Lost is right for you.Season 1 of Lost is a great first season to a fantastic show. I have watched it several times and I find something new to enjoy every time. This is a quality box set that I think most people no matter their tastes in films and TV series can enjoy. I wholeheartedly recommends Lost The Complete First Season.
