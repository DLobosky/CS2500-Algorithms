Trying to cut some of our bills we decided to take the plunge and cancel our cable subscription. We have a 50" Samsung plasma tv and had the cable with the HD box. It looked good...so when we decided to cut the cable I thought the tv would "go to waste" because the over the air channels would look grainy and dim. After reading some reviews I decided to purchase this antenna (DB4) over the DB2 because we have another tv upstairs I wanted to hook up as well. Well the antenna arrived extremely fast, like in a day or two...even before my cable was cut! Once the cable was finally cut I put the antenna together (took about 10 minutes) not too hard but the picture/directions could be a little better, I then proceed to go into my attic, look for the cable line going to my tv and connected it to the antenna. Pretty easy. I did not purchase the antenna holder/pole so I placed the antenna over some boxes we have in the attic just to get an idea of what it would look like. I did not place it in a particular direction, I figured I could tweak it after seeing the initial reception. I then ran downstairs, turned on the tv, held my breath (did a new channel scan) and lo and behold all my local channels showed up looking TERRIFIC! No delays, no grainy dim looking pictures but very bright, HD channels. I have to say some look nicer (brighter colors, clearer picture) than my HD cable channels did. Of course all channels now have 2-3 more channels i.e. channel 13, channel 13-2, 13-3 etc.. the best looking ones are the "main" channels i.e 2, 13, 11 etc.. (we are in the Houston, TX market). So overall we are VERY PLEASED with this antenna. We have a 2 story house in a typical neighborhood so if your situation is like ours and you are contemplating purchasing this antenna you will not be dissapointed!On a side note...my father purchased the DB2 for a small 32" LCD he has after hearing about my rave reviews and his tv also looks great. He put his on top of the bookcase behind a decorative plant and it worked like a charm. He had gone through a good many antenna before this one but this one looks like a keeper.
