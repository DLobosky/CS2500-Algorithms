Erotica's problem is also working as fiction that has a plot, character development, and feeling. The only work for me that has ever totally transcended the stigma barrier of being erotica is my favorite film, &quot;Last Tango In Paris.&quot;  It manages to be a first rate work of art while also being sexually explicit and obsessed throughout. Its screenplay is also written for both men's and women's benefit.  &quot;Last Tango&quot; need not fear any competition from this anthology.  This anthology works fine as erotica for women but I doubt many men would like it because the point-of-view is slanted towards women being in control and power.  This anthology cannot compete with well-written historical romantic fiction either.  Robin Schone's novella is the best written and works best as fiction but does not work as well as erotica as Small's or Devine's.  Small's novella is very kinky and the prose is so purple, I found myself breaking into laughter at certain spots.  It almost reads like a parody of romance crossed with erotica.  Small knows how to set an erotica scene though and play it out for maximum effect.  I can see why she sells so many books.  I can't take much of Thea Devine's writing but her stream of consciousness style also basically works as erotica.  I also found myself breaking into laughter at several absurd junctures while reading Devine's work.  I tried reading the Susan Johnson novella but found it boring.  The Johnson scores the lowest for me, not working on any level.  I didn't finish it.  I'm not sure Robin Schone is doing herself a favor by featuring her work with the other three authors.  She is the only one of the three trying to walk the tightrope between fiction and erotica, like &quot;Last Tango In Paris&quot; does.  She succeeds better with her blended style when she is on her own and in novel length.  I also wonder if she doesn't belong more in mainstream fiction since she prefers writing about unsettling themes and plots.  I always have the sense with her writing that she's holding herself back, not delivering a one-two punch to the reader because she's trying to remain within the confines of the romance genre's formula.  I believe she may do better artistically by abandoning any formula.  I've read one novel apiece for each author prior to this anthology and have read several by Johnson.  I've given three stars to this anthology.  It is four stars as erotica written for women but only two stars as romantic fiction.  The average figure between those two ratings is three stars and hence the grade.
