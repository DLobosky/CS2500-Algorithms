It started up and I had the option to click a button to get the latest version off the web.  The browser opens and I get another error "Cannot Process Your Request at this time."  Great.  Well, I manually navigated the website, downloaded the software and started the installer.  The first thing I get is a warning saying "The recommended screen resolution to run NeatWorks is 1024 x 768. After installing, please modify your screen resolution to get full screen capabilities of the application."  Really?  1024 x 768?  Sorry NeatWorks, but I don't have a ten year old monitor.  The most common laptop screens today have horizontal resolutions of 1600 and above and the desktop I was installing on has a resolution of 1920 x 1080.  I'm not about to make all my other programs look enormous just to accommodate NeatWorks.The install takes a long time and various windows appear.  Near the end a message box appears that says "Installing Neat ADF Scanner 2008 Driver".  2008?  Isn't that three years ago?  I thought I had bought the latest version of this scanner...  Anyway, the rest of the install went fine.  When I started the software, it did say Copyright 2010 so it appears to be only one year old.Of course, when I started it, again it complained that it wants 1024 x 768 screen resolution, and warned me that my resolution was LOWER than this even though my resolution is 1920 x 1080.  No matter, it doesn't seem to affect anything.When you first run the software it plays a tutorial video which is helpful and not too long. I recommend watching it.Anyway, I scanned some test receipts and they scanned in fine.  You do have to press the "Scan" button on the scanner for EACH scan (it would be nice if it would just keep scanning as you feed in more receipts).  But the big problem was that I couldn't find the image files after the scans were complete.  After some digging around on their website I discovered the horrible news.  There are no image files.That's right, this "scanner" doesn't save the scanned images as image files on your hard drive. Here I was thinking that's what scanners are supposed to do, but this one doesn't.  It seems this scanner is "integrated" with the "document management system" (i.e. the software) that comes on the CD. Scans are imported and stored inside a database that's part of this software, but they're not available to you on your hard drive.  I even searched my entire c: drive to see if there was some temporary folder where I could find these images.  Unfortunately, they were nowhere to be found.More digging on their website and I found out that the only way to get image files is to select the image in their software program (NeatWorks) and choose "Save Current Visible Image As".  Unfortunately, you have to do this ONE-BY-ONE!!!  Yes, there's no way to just export all your scanned receipts as image files.  You can multi-select receipts that haven't been filed yet and export them to PDF, but they get saved as a single giant multi-page PDF file.So, if you want a very expensive scanner that stores all of your data in a proprietary database format and is completely useless as a normal scanner, go ahead and drop $180 on this product.  As for me, I'm taking advantage of the Amazon guarantee and returning it.PS - The software uses an "activation key" and only allows you to install it on two computers. This is completely unrealistic for any small business that needs to share the scanner (it's portable after all) among several employees.  If you want to spend $180 and buy a separate scanner for every two computers you have, then this one's for you.
