Well gosh folks, after waiting twelve years for a new record from Cher I feel like I should have more to say about it now that one is actually here. Closer to the Truth is by no means a bad album, make no mistake about it. In fact I'm actually really enjoying it and predict it won't leave my player for a while. But at the same time, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't exactly the kind of dance/pop album I expected it to be, with no additional frills or surprises. The thing is, Believe and Living Proof, brilliant and groundbreaking as they were in their day, followed very specific formulas which, fast forward to 2013, Cher has strayed very little from. Again, that isn't necessarily a criticism, but don't go into it expecting some grand reinvention or that she has spent all this time secretly plotting the next big trend. If you have kept up with Cher at all since about 1998, this should be familiar territory to you.So with that said, I'm still very pleased with what she has delivered here. The bulk of the album is comprised of catchy, upbeat tracks that are definitely club-oriented, yet also successfully fuses elements of different genres together to forge identities of their own. Some moments even hark back to the more adult contemporary, "rocker chick" Cher of the 80's, which I know many fans were eager to see resurface again. Ironically, it's the first single, Woman's World, that is probably the least representative of the record as a whole. Yes, it's fun in the moment, but probably not one you'll be caught singing to yourself later. My Love finds Cher channeling Donna Summer in a surreal 70's inspired anthem, and she goes just a little bit country for Favorite Scars, a song that wouldn't be entirely out of place on the Heart of Stone album. Every Cher album is entitled to one true power ballad, and I Hope You Find It takes up that role here. Sirens is a little more low-key, but I love the imagery invoked by the lyrics. If I had to choose, I'd say Dressed to Kill is actually my favorite song on the disc. Despite what others will tell you, she actually reins in the vocoder and techno effects quite a bit on this record compared to prior releases, but they're back in full force on this song that for some reason I can only describe as "very European." Truth be told there really aren't any songs here that I would go as far as to call bad, though a couple such as Red and Take it Like a Man didn't really stand out or leave much of an impression on me one way or the other. As far as the exclusive bonus tracks from the red bullseye retailer, the only one I'm super impressed with is the poignant Will You Wait For Me, mostly because I find the lyrics personally relatable.Anyhow, these are just my early thoughts, but I think it's safe to say any existing Cher fan should be satisfied overall and have some fun with this, though I can't honestly say I'm able to picture any of these tracks exploding up the mainstream charts or becoming timeless classics in the vein of Turn Back Time or Believe. Otherwise, she's at the top of her form and can still belt it out like no other. If anything her voice has only gotten deeper since the last time we heard from her, if you can imagine that, lol. Ultimately, those who are touting it as "worth the wait" or "her best CD yet" may be a little overzealous and are probably just excited to have something new at all, but it's a solid pop record nevertheless and worth getting a hold of if you have the chance.
