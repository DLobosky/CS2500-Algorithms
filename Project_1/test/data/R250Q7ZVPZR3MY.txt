Unfortunately, these authors gave the same pat 19th century liberal gospel approach.  I was dissatisfied.  I wanted to see hair fly and punches connect.The main bad guys are Anselm and Charles Hodge.  Even their critiques of Hodge, and I have problems with Hodge, were pathetic.  They could have really nailed him.  And they thought that answering Hodge answered all of the Reformed objections. It didn't. I do not think they dealt as fairly with St Anselm as he could have. David Bentley Hart (*Beauty of the Infinite*) has shown how St Anselm and St Athanasius do not fundamentally disagree. Another problem I had is that biblical students need to see that the Bible incorporates all 3 models of the atonement (Mark 10 = substitutionary; Colossians 2:15 = Christus Victor; Peter 2:21 = exemplary). Lacking in Power?  The early church, particularly in its Eastern manifestation, set forth a powerful view of the atonement where Christ triumphed over the powers.  This is missing from this book.  Skip it.  Read Rene Girard for an interesting take on the substitutionary atonement.
