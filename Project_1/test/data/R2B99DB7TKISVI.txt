Yes, I'm a flashlight junkie and I've seen a lot of amazing lights in the past few years and next year there will be one that impresses me more - but this big clunky flashlight beats the socks off of everything except the $400 H.I.D. lights I've used.Recommendation: Pick the Fenix TK70 if size, weight, price, and runtime isn't all that important but you want to get the most light you can hold in your hand + impress everyone around you. Pick the Fenix TK60 if size, weight, price, and runtime are important and you want to impress just a little less.  They both use 4 D batteries and the use the same LED emitter but theTK70 has 3 emitters while the TK60 only has one.Important! The best way to power this light is with NiMh rechargeable batteries. If you buy from Amazon, I'd recommend the AccuEvolution Low-Self-Discharge D cells - about $44 for 4 - but they will last for years if properly charged. THE BEST way to properly charge them is with the Maha MH-C808M charger - about $84 from Amazon - but it charges AAA, AA, C, and D cells perfectly and will not overcharge your batteries resulting in premature failure. There are cheaper chargers but don't be tempted - this one's the best in my opinion.If you have many things that run on rechargeable batteries, get the Maha charger and Sanyo Eneloop AAA and AA batteries and AccuEvolution C and D batteries - all available on Amazon. YOU WILL save many $$ over time. Back to the flashlight - This is an Amazing, well-built Flashlight and you will love it. Take it out at night and say "watch this" in your neighborhood and listen to everyone say "Wow!"
