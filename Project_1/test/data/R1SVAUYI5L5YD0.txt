There are no easily heard or seen descriptions of the exercises that the individual should perform to improve the function of eye. Nevertheless the book is incomplete perplexing a little bit, it has enough liveliness, humor, and variety.If you are about to improve your eyesight, I would have recommended to read this book first to understand the framework, and then proceed to another books which are based on the Bates method but have sound explanations of what actually the patient have to do, e.g. "The natural way to better eyesight" by J.I. Rodale, "Conscious Seeing" by R. Kaplan, "How to improve your eyes" by M. D., Corbett, "Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses" by S. M. Beresford, and so forth.
