When I saw Susie Bright's name on this collection of erotica I knew that I had to have it. The first collection of hers that I read was called HEROTICA and I have been hooked ever since. Her books are guaranteed to be  imagintivly written and hot. She always has a nice mixture of hetro, homo,  and lesbian eroticism with a dollop of fetishism thrown in to her  collections. It makes for an eclectic, enjoyable read.
