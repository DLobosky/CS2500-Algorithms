These  dvds are great, I have the vol.1 and 2 and I love them, each routine in the dvd, is 30 minutes long, but your not going to lose a minute of it, that is moving and breathing all the time, after you finish, you feel that your whole body worked hard, and at the same time very relaxed, You have 2 routines of 30 minutes in each dvd, you can choose to do one or both for a challenging workout. Al the routines are so differet, so you never get bored. Like I said before I love this dvd. I'll buy all the series from her.
