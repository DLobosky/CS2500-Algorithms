Even in films that were saved by the superior performances of others - such as Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man", or Paul Newman in "The Color of Money"- Tom still played the cocky unlikable character.  With a handful of bizarre public appearances, he developed a nearly universal reputation, Sloane Crosley wrote in Village Voice, as "one spoke behind Michael Jackson on the freak wheel."This is his cocky bartender movie.
