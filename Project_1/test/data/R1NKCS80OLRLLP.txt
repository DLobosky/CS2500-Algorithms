My wife and I eventually purchased this television as a replacement for that one. Since it is usually better to break down a product into criteria, I might as well do that. Video: This television is 1080p, which is the highest level of HD. Since I do not have a high definition cable channels or a blue ray disk player, the only way I can really rate HD video is my indoor antennae, which gets a couple high def channels, and my xbox 260, which has a high def cable. Although the xbox 360 is not really true HD, it still looks incredible, and really shows the improvement of s-cable to HD component. To date, I have not used the available HDMI ports. The image is clear, bright, and easy to see. The ability to use computers is great with a vga and sound port, and everything on the computer screen, particularly text, is clear and easy to follow as well. Sound: The sound is very nice, and I never have to turn the sound over 30 of 100. Also note I like my TV loud usually, so the sound is as good as I would every expect from a television. This includes using the TV as speakers for your computer, which it also can do perfectly fine.Menu: This is something frequently not mentioned on most televisions, but is very important to me. The menu is very easy to use and read. More than that, it gives you tons of options.  A lack of options is something that always bothered me about other televisions. Besides being able to affect the colors and dark levels with a large variety of options, you can also effect sound. Not just bass and treble, you can also manipulate the lip syncing and use of speakers (turning them off if this is ever needed) When using a computer, you can manipulate the screen, so in the cases that the resolution doesn't match up, the tv with compensate for you. Extras: Perhaps one of the coolest things to me is the ability to display a guide on digital channels. On the antennae, and maybe cable without DVR too, the tv can automatically gather and display the list of the next 2-3 hours of tv shows, so even without digital television, you can see what shows are coming up and when without the use of tv guide channel. The remote is decent, but you can still do just about everything with the tv, so you are not dependent on the remote like some tvs make you. To sum it up: This television is very good and worth the price that I spent on it, around $900. It has held up for about 9 months now, and still runs strong. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it constantly uses power when it is plugged in. Most devices do, and this one shows you by displaying an "orange" light that spells out vizio in the front. I also wouldn't mind if it started up a little quicker. Those two things aside, the tv is great for numerous purposes, from watching movies to tv to computer monitor. Definitely a recommended buy.Update: After reading another review, I figured I should add that after a year of owning the Tv, the top 1/3 of the television starting shimmering and going black. We have it under warranty and are in the process of getting it repaired. It still works, and the problem actually isn't bad enough that we can't watch TV, but the other review I read makes me fear this may be a common problem with this television. Just keep that in mind, otherwise, I love it, and I recently got HD cable and I love that too, it is still a great TV, presuming it doesn't break on you.
