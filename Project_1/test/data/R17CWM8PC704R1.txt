A second re-release, this time most definitely released, on a "Widescreen Anamorphic DVD Format" is long overdue."THIS ISLAND EARTH" Directed by Joseph Newman, Starring: Jeff Morrow, Faith Domerque, Rex Reason have an screenplay by Franklin Coen and Edward G O'Callaghan. It deals with the saga of a pair of rocked scientist that are taken from earth on a flying saucer by the misterious alien, Exeter, to aid in the defence of his planet "Metaluna." The incredible special effects took two and half years in the making, filmed in "Out Of This World Widescreen Technicolor." The film was theatrically released in 1955, which fifty years after this screen debut is now regarded as the archetypal sci-fi flick of the Fifties.We are confident that an anamorphic widescreen release would also be well awaited by "Sci-Fi Collectors" on 2005, at this instant, that Steven Spielberg is doing a new remade of "War of The Worlds" to critical acclaims reviews.Please! MCA/UNIVERSAL HOME VIDEO. Just look at the re-sale price on the internet for "Used Full Screen DVD" copies of this movie. Since some are going for $375.00 and up and do the right thing by releasing this feature now on an " SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN DVD EDITION."
