I was using headphones a lot for work last summer, so I wanted some ear cup ones that would be more comfortable.These were a big upgrade to what I was using. I got them on sale for ~$80 and for that price I'm pretty happy.Sound quality: I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not too picky. These have good enough base, and crisp sound that is pleasant to listen to. Way better than my crappy clip on headphones, and way better than my ear buds, I'm sure there is better, but for me they are great. I like to listen to music on very low volume for long periods of time.Noise cancellation: Decent. I bought these hoping that I wouldn't be able to hear anything with them on, so I could listen to music on very low volume even if the office was loud or I was in public. They muffle noise pretty well, but I can still hear people talk and the tapping of feet or keyboard keys. They work fine, and if I turn the volume up I can't hear much else, but this was disappointing. If you need this feature, look for something else.Comfort: Very comfortable for me with or without glasses. I can wear these for 1-3 hours just fine. Sometimes my head starts to feel pressure from wearing them too long, so I'll take them off or switch to earbuds for a bit. They are way more comfortable than my other headphones and I am happy with that. The only uncomfortable part is putting them around your neck. They fold a bit, but they still feel like they choke me. Even if I extend them all the way they're a bit uncomfortable around my neck. I wish the backside of the headphones had a bit of padding so I could flip one around and rest it behind my ear without the plastic hitting me.Portability: I kept these in my bag for 2 semesters at college. They're not broken, but the cushions are definitely worn from it. Pretty much any way you fold them up doesn't really protect them or make them much smaller. My friend has a pair that fold up pretty tight and protect themselves really well. When these break I'll be switching to something like that. These are definitely better suited to sit on a desk, but for me they go with my laptop bag.The cable is long and nice for sitting, but annoying for walking around so keep that in mind.Overall I am happy with the purchase for the price. The headphones are good, but not amazing. I wish I had got some that were better protected when folded up, and I probably will next time, but if these last another year then they were definitely worth it.
