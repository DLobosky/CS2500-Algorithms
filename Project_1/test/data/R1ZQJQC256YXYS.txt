Every year holidays get more and more demanding and less and less fun.  Richard Carlson has welcome advice for getting through it all a lot happier than we have in the past and a little closer to those warm and fuzzy feelings we expect from this time of year than we usually get.  Although there is little in the book that is surprising or new, it is presented in convenient little segments in a wonderfully readable form.  The author presents the material using his own experiences and those of others to illustrate his points in each chapter and does so succinctly and with great sense of humor.  I found the book a delight and read it from cover to cover in about two hours.  I expect to monitor my own behavior and that of others around me and to re-read the appropriate chapters until I manage to succeed in getting through my holidays with a happy disposition.  A good resource for everyone any day of the year when we find ourselves rehearsing unpleasant events from our days activities without generating either solutions to problems or a new way of thinking about things.
