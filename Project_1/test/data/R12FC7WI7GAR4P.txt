This is the First Ana and Ravi DVD that I bought and remains a firm favourite!Filmed on a pure white background the production is great and accompanying music is lovely.The Kundalini Class begins with a Tune in via a mantra and then into the warm up section. The Kundalini yoga sets come next and are each followed by a short period of relaxation in savasana (lying down 'corpse' pose) from this point you can either end your class and go to relaxation and or meditation otherwise you can carry on and do the whole class. Next is the relaxation in savasana for a longer duration and then there are two meditations...the choice is yours which one to do or you could do both depending on time and whatever you feel like doing on the day. To end is a Tune out. I feel energised yet tranquil and calm when I have completed the session....for me it is blissful and continues into the day (I do morning practice).I find Ana inspirational and Ravi is so full of encouragement during the sets. I work within my limitations on any given day, all are slightly different for me so I try to go with the flow.I had practiced Hatha yoga for approx one year before discovering Kundalini Yoga. My main practice is now Kundalini Yoga.
