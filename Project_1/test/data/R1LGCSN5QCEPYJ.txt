It's easy to use, smells good, the packaging is fun, & washes out easily. I add it to dry or damp hair & scrunch it up, so I haven't used it for straight hairstyles (which I don't want anyway). It's a very easy styling product.I get pliable hold, touchable softness, & natural looking hair - it doesn't look gelled, glued, matted, or greasy - just natural & nice. I'm surprised it's not a really stiff punk-hold cementing gel (this is the highest hold level in this line of gels) but I'm still pleasantly surprised at how well it works for my needs. No helmet hair but definitely lasting hold. My hair is soft but doesn't fall flat all day long (even after sleeping).
