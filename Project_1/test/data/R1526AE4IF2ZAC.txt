Why I got it: Slipped on a patch of ice this winter, seriously sprained an ankle, wrenched my back. Lugging around my usual vacuum, let alone moving AT ALL...was incredibly painful. The dust bunnies were building up, plus the accumulated &quot;stuff&quot; that hits the floor every day.- food crumbs, bits of paper, the usual mess of life.   Although I was skeptical, I figured the Roomba HAD to be better than nothing -  even though the price seemed high. The results? Better than I ever expected. I sat down, watched television and let it take over a HUGE room. It crossed the room in some random pattern that made no sense to me but within 20 minutes or so, the floor was actually clean. I could walk across it in my socks. Having said that, this is NOT a miracle worker, not a substitute for deep cleaning or mopping...and you do have to spend a bit of time &quot;prepping&quot; the room, making sure big stuff is off the floor and moving loose cords out of the way. But I always did this with my regular vacuum, anyway, not wanting to risk jamming it with a loose paper clip or rubber band. My ankle and back are fine now but I still use the Roomba regularly. It saves me time and energy, especially in the rooms we don't use a lot but which need a regular going over. An added bonus? It is fun to take out at parties and impress the &quot;techies&quot; ....the people who always have the latest gadget.
