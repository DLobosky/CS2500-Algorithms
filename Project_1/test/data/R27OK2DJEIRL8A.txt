You get the drill, 2 batteries, a charger, a laser level, a bit-measuring device and a case to put it all in.The drill itself has forward and reverse operation as well as high-torque and high-speed modes.  These are relatively standard features as far as cordless drills go.  Also, there is no need for a chuck key.  You just use the grip on the end.  Again, standard.The drill is powerful and comfortable to use.Where this drill fails is the batteries.  They are Nickel Cadmium (NiCd).  NiCad batteries are an old technology that suffer from memory issues.  They have been largely replaced by NiMH and LiIon batteries.  Apparently Skil missed the memo.  These batteries will not last you long.  They have no shelf-life (meaning they discharge just by sitting there), and they don't have very much energy density.  They're crap.At around $50 per replacement battery, you might as well buy an entirely new drill when one of these batteries dies.  In addition, Skil does not have a LiIon or NiMH option to replace these batteries with.  So, go with another drill if you want something reliable.EDIT:  Skil has since released a Li-Ion compatible battery for this model (SC118B-LI).  The Li-Ion batteries are $90 a piece and you need a new charger.  So you have to fork over around $100 for the battery and charger kit, then another $90 if you want a spare so you don't have to wait an hour for the battery to charge.  What can one expect out of a charger that sells for $10 in the kit?  Since Li-Ion batteries operate best in the 20-80% range (they don't like to be discharged all the way and they don't like to be charged all the way), you're likely to burn through your Li-Ion batteries fairly quickly with a "dumb" charger and a "dumb" drill that was originally made for NiCd batteries.  By that, I mean there needs to be logic circuits in the drill that cut the power to the battery before it drains it completely and circuits in the charger that cut power before it charges it too much.  Otherwise, you're not maximizing the life on your $90 batteries.  Needless to say, it's hard to justify the cost of upgrading this drill to Lithium when the lithium batteries cost more than the drill itself.  Since the time I originally wrote the review for this drill, my second NiCd battery no longer holds its charge and now my drill is worthless since I can't justify upgrading it to lithium.  I have since purchased a wonderful Milwaukee 12v Li-Ion impact drill with aforementioned logic circuits for preserving the battery.  I cannot speak to Skil's new line of Li-ion battery-powered drills with regard to logic circuits, but I can say that upgrading this Skil drill to Li-ion is probably a giant waste of money.  Take that $[...] or $[...] and put it towards a native Li-ion drill and charger that know how to treat a good battery.
