We bought these (the Phinex) strips and we also bought the "PHion Balance PHion Diagnostic Ph Test Strips, 90-Count"Our family tested out both of the different strips over a few weeks and found that these strips (the Phinex) were much more accurate than the PHion strips.Water should have a pH of 7.0 so, assuming that our water is what it should be, we tested these strips and they were right on 7.0 from our water.We tested the other strips (the PHion) and they tested the water as 6.5-6.75. Testing ourselves, we found that the other strips (the PHion) tested more acidic than the Phinex.The only thing that we don't like about these strips (the Phinex) is that they come in a plastic container that makes it hard to get the lid on and off. It would be so much better if they came in a little bottle like the PHion do.You'll want to be careful when opening these from their little container box that you don't pull too hard or when the cap finally does come off, some of the strips may go flying with the force (the force of you pulling that is, not The Force :)What really got us started on testing our pH was reading the book The pH Miracle which had some very good background on why pH levels are so important, success stories, and recipes that our family enjoys quite a bit. Some of the theories are just that, theories, but the evidence that we do know and is presented in the book is pretty good.Stay alkaline.
