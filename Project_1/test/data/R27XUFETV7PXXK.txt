It's a good product but the fiber wheels does wear out fairly fast and all of my local hardware stores don't sell 3" fiber wheels, I can only find 4" and up but they won't fit on the mini-grinder so, every time I need a replacement fiber wheel I also have to buy the grinding wheel. If you are ready to do a LOT of grinding it's a good deal but otherwise I won't recommend this product because you will end up with a drawer full of 3" grinding wheels which is a waste of $$$...just doesn't makes any sense at all. Might as well use that money to buy a different brand 6" bench grinder. That's the reason why I gave this product "1 Star". They should sell the fiber wheel individually and not in pairs. .
