I bought this crate for my 7 pound tiny cat after purchasing and returning a pink one that was not all that sturdy looking (it was held together by crappy little plastic pins and came with no instructions).  This one is far superior, and the same price.  I got this for $20 at Walmart.  I LOVE the pink! So cute!  My kitty went right in, and while I thought it looked small, there was plenty of room for her inside.  My big full size cat also checked it out, but she was kind of pushing it on the size scale.  I am going to use this for short car trips and it will do perfectly fine.  Great carrier!
