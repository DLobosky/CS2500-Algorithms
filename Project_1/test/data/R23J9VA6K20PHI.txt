Her voice is lithe, but with a charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist; hence her success, mostly with her band Union Station.  In 1995 the band Alison Krauss & Union Station (AKUS) released their seventh album "So Long, So Wrong," which went on to garner critical acclaim, but not very much commercial success.  As is the band's style they stayed away from the lavishly produced, pseudo-C&W Pop that so marks other groups their adopted genre and instead remain fairly close to their Bluegrass roots.  But perhaps the CD was under-produced and engineered if there is such a malady.Most of the album's vocal tracks were too quiet; i.e. it was hard to understand the lyrics throughout most of the CD especially when Ms. Krauss was taking lead.  The especially true on the CD's title track, So Long, So Wrong (track No. 1), wherein Ms. Kruass's already lithe voice is at points inaudible.  The same holds true for track No. 2 No Place To Hide, track No. 3 Deeper Than Crying, but to a lesser extent, track No. 4 I Can Let Go Now, track No. 5 The Road is a Lover, track No. 7 It Doesn't Matter, well you get the picture.  The musicianship was flawless as usual, but the quiet vocal tracks detracted from my overall enjoyment of the CD.       That is not to say the entire album is a throwaway because of the vocal shortcomings, far from it.  "So Long, So Wrong" maintains the bands tradition of fine musicianship and crisp clear harmonizing vocals (when they can be heard that is) and is overall a worthy AKUS release; just not my favorite.    When Krauss isn't spotlighted on center stage, her presence is still apparent in the guise of her high (soprano) harmonies and energetic fiddle.  Her ability to blend into the group, fade into the body as it were, only buttresses the sense that AKUS are indeed a band rather than merely a supporting backdrop for Krauss's solo efforts.  An equaling male vocal cord is struck by guitarist and long time band member Dan Tyminski, who brings more traditional bluegrass sound to the group.  And Ron Block, who is not the strongest (solo) vocalists is an excellent song writer, and contributed two track to the album, track No. 11 Pain of a Troubled Mind (lead vocals) and track No. 14, the hauntingly beautiful There is a Reason. "So Long, So Wrong" is an ambitious CD; there are fourteen vocal tracks and one instrumental, track No. 6 Little Liza Jane.  When released the song were included on a two-album set, but only one CD.  All of the members of AKUS play instruments, indeed they are all considered virtuosos.  The circa 1997 group included Alison Krauss (vocals, fiddle, violin), Barry Bales (acoustic bass), Ron Block (banjo, guitar, vocals), Adam Steffey (mandolin), and Dan Tyminski (guitar, mandolin, vocals).  Adam Steffey has since left the group to be replaced by Jerry Douglas on the dobro. All and all "So Long, So Wrong" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.  The instrumentation on the CD is top notch and more than part of the reason I love this group so much; they have such a passion for Bluegrass and make this quintessential form of American music swell the soul.
