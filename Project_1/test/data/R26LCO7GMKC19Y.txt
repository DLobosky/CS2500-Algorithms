I had been looking for some time for a well-priced, professional keyboard for my children, who play.  I was super excited to find this Yamaha keyboard for an awesome price PLUS free shipping.  It sounds amazing and has all kinds of bells and whistles and doodads.One word of advice, KNOW IN ADVANCE that this does NOT come with a power adapter, you will have to purchase that separately.  Unfortunately, I did not know that, and Christmas morning was sad when my kids weren't able to play it immediately.
