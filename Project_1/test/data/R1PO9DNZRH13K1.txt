I just ordered alot of items from Amazon recently, so all my reviews will start the same, just with different sellers of course:Amazon & WholeSaleAV gets 5 stars for extremely fast regular/standard shipping!! Was supposed to come June 30 - July 3; I ordered this on the June 24th, it arrived June 26th!!Now on to the product...These speakers are good for the small size. I have these connected a Onkyo SR606 and I constantly worry about disturbing my neighbors. I even have the front speakers set too high up and the sound is still good.
