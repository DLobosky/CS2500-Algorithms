As far as practicality goes, this mouse covers the important bases.  It's comfortable, sensitive, and has enough buttons to allow the important functions without being confusing.  When I bought the MX 510 mouse I didn't really expect it to last long.  Says something for Logitech I suppose.  I never used the top 3 buttons much, they are pretty easy to press accidentally while scrolling.  The thumb buttons however, are almost perfectly placed.Logitech has probably updated their software since I last used it, but while I had the MX 510 I often used plug and play only with no real problems.  I recommend this mouse for someone looking for a good mouse without breaking the bank.
