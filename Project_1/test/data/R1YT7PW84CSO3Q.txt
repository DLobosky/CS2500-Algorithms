I LOVE this book!  It is full of fresh, unique projects that I can't wait to get started on.  The photos are beautiful and inspiring and the directions are clear and very detailed (unlike some sewing books).  There is a pocket with full-sized patterns in the back of the book which is very useful.  I buy a lot of sewing books and this is the best one I've seen in a long while.  Beautiful!
