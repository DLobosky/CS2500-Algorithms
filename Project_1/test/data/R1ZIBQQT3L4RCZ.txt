He is really an outstanding communicator and clearly a very proficient instructor. If you have been exposed to this type of thing before, the pacing is just right; minimal explanation with maximum demonstration. It is "chaptered" well too, so if any section goes by too quickly you can always skip back and replay it again.The material is very well organized too, beginning with an explanation of the structure of the shoulder and then quickly moving into a variety of techniques. It is a great overview with enough depth that you can practice what you have learned with a partner afterward. Contents include raising shoulder locks, pulling shoulder locks, "chicken wing" locks and variations thereof, bent arm shoulder locks, and "figure-four" locks.These applications can be used offensively or defensively in a variety of situations in the ring and/or on the street. Previously covered principles, footwork, and blocks from earlier DVDs are once again incorporated in this one so there is a single thread from volume to volume with a logical build of the materials. These techniques are common to most fighting styles and will benefit nearly anyone from traditional practitioners to modern mixed martial artists.Burrese moves well, explains clearly, demonstrates effectively, and ensures that viewers truly understand the materials. While no DVD can be a substitute for hands-on instruction, this one is so good that it's the next best thing to being there, solid, practical instruction that can be invaluable for practitioners of most any martial style. Very well done!Lawrence Kane Author of Martial Arts Instruction and Surviving Armed Assaults; co-author of The Way of Kata and The Way to Black Belt
