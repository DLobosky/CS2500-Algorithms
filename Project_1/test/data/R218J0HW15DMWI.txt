I had some friends who raised them when I was a kid and a professor who had one when I was in seminary. I remembered them as being impressing, friendly and faithful. Just to be sure, though, I bought this book to learn a little bit more. I'm glad I did.The book does a fair job of covering the basics that any dog owner would need to know and does them from the point of view of having a dog that may well be the second largest member of the family. It is common sense to know that a Great Dane can steal food off your counter top a lot more effectively than a Chihuahua but there are other factors that are not so obvious. The book also does a reasonable job of going through the early training process and getting the dog house broken. This turned out to be of less use to us because the dog we obtained was already an adult and had been trained. Still, it might come in handy in the future.For me, information about the breed was of the most use. This included discussion of temperament, differing varieties and such. After reading it, I felt able to make an informed decision about getting the dog. Clyde is now a loved member of the family and the cat is still hacked off.
