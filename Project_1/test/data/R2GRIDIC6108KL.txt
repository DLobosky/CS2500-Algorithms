The bouts in the main card are all outstanding. It starts with a grappling bonanza between Grove and Cote, a fight that has an unbelievable finish to boot. Stevenson and Pellegrino show us how much talent is present in the lightweight division, and we get to witness an evenly-matched fight where the contenders demonstrate how well-rounded their game is. If you can believe it, things get even better, with two extremely dangerous guys going head to head. Huerta is a powerful and well-rounded fighter that has been making a lot of noise in the UFC. Crane is one of the best Ju-Jitsu fighters in the world. I can only describe the confrontation as: What a fight!!Then the more "famous" figures come in, with St. Pierre staging his comeback against the dominant Koscheck, who recently gave Sanchez his first loss. This is a fight full of surprises, with a nice variety of techniques and some very entertaining grappling and brawling. Finally, we get to the main event of the evening, with forty-three-year-old Couture trying to defend his title against the up and coming Gonzaga. The intensity of this fight is unbelievable, you cannot miss it!Even though the main card fights are good enough to place this event among the best, most of the under card bouts are up to par. The only exception is Guida vs. Aurelio, which has the problem of it being a one-sided match-up. Those that like bloody fights will get two of them in this set; they almost look like a scene in a horror movie. In one of these, things go even further and the winner chokes out the loser, after the tap out, putting him to sleep. The reason: insults during the weigh-in. The attitude of the winner was wrong, but it is still useful to show that sometimes you have to be careful about how you treat others. I highly recommend this event; it will go down as one of the best in the history of the UFC.
