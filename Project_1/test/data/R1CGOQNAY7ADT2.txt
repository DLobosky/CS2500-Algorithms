Based on price and reviews, I bought these earbuds along with a pair of V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black (same price). In a direct comparison, I prefer the Sennheisers because they sound just a little crisper. They fit my ears right out of the package, frequency response is good and the bass is great, plus they seriously block outside noises (which could be a good or bad thing, what with a wife and child in the house). I would expect to pay more for earbuds of this quality; consider me very satisfied with my purchase. One gripe: The cord is designed to go behind your head, so the cord for the right bud is longer than the left. I don't like that there's more weight pulling on the left bud, and I prefer to wear the cord to the front. For that reason, I don't find them ideal for wearing while I'm active.
