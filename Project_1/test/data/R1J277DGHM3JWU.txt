There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is a comparison of the BD vs 2007 DVD version.  I own the 4:3 aspect ratio DVD release, and have seen the 2007 release on DVD too.  The BD version is by far, the best version released even if the aspect ratio is not 4:3.  The audio and video is the clearest ever.  Since Kubrick's movies are highly visual experiences, the better the video and audio, the better the movie is too.  The clarity of BD immerses you in the experience, as if you too were there.  Kubrick's legendary attention to detail is even more appreciated in high resolution, as the grandeur of the Hotel, the exquisite details including the actor's faces and responses, jump out even more than the theatrical release.  There are no audio option settings on the disk but it plays like stereo only, not surround or 5.1.  In the extras in the disk, mention is made of 'restoration', but I don't recall if it referred to the 2007 release, or to the BD release.
