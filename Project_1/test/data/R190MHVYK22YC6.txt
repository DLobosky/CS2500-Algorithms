My infant was suffering with allergies that caused furious eye rubbing constantly when in the room and could not sleep. The problem caused eczema break out as well on the face. I could not figure out what it was, dust mites, dust particles or what. I laundered the bedding several times in a week, switched her sleeping bed and bedding to different ones several times to no avail. The only time she would rub her eyes less and get some sleep was when she slept on my chest. Needless to say i was out of my wits trying to figure out what the problem was and exhausted. The only thing i could do was cry and actually pray.Then Jesus answered my prayer. Instead of trying to figure out the exact problem, just apply a comprehensive solution. Looking on the internet to see what solutions there were for allergy sufferers, it looked upwards over a thousand dollars in getting different gadgets to purify dwelling, such as air purifier, state of the art vacuum cleaner, dehumidifier, etc.I looked at the state of the art vacuum cleaner (Miele or something like that) that would cost at least $500. I did not think we could afford that, especially if i had to add other gadgets besides. Then came the idea that steam kills just about anything. In my search however, the SteamVac came up. It was not a steam cleaner, and did not even heat the water that it used. However, i thought that if it did not kill things at least it would leak up most of whatever small agents causing allergies.So when the unit arrived, it took me 3-4 hours to wash the room carpet and dry it completely. Using 1:3 vinegar water solution. Very slow process but worth every inch. I could tell the difference walking on it. The carpet was new, but obviously something was on it. The water was not very dirty. Thereafter, laundered bedding once more. The eye rubbing reduced significantly, and in the next few days it was gone.So for 140 dollars, worth every penny.
