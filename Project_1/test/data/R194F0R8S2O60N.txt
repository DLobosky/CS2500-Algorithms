I purchased a new Western Digital 1.50 TB Caviar Green SATA Intellipower 64 MB Cache WD15EARS hard drive from Amazon on 11/20/2010. The drive is good to go out of the box. It is quiet, runs cool to the touch, and it is fast. I also purchased a Thermaltake BlacX eSATA USB Docking Station and I use the eSATA connection on my ASUS N61JV-X2 notebook PC which I purchased from Amazon as well running Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. In my configuration, I decided to encrypt the Western Digital Caviar Green hard drive using Microsoft BitLocker using a very strong password that changes every 30 days.I use this new hard drive to store HDTV TV shows that I recorded live from Microsoft Windows Media Center and my AverMedia AverTV Hybrid Volar MAX USB TV Tuner stick. I also store my Apple iTunes library and my 1,050 CD collection using Apple Lossless encoding. Lastly, I keep a copy of my most critical data and software applications repository on the drive as well.There have been no problems whatsoever with the hard drive or the hard drive docking station through USB 2.0 or eSATA connection. The Western Digital Caviar Green SATA hard drive and Thermaltake BlacX eSATA USB Docking Station are excellent choices that provide for an unlimited amount of storage capacity at a low cost. I intend on purchasing more of the same hard drives in the near future as my storage needs continue to grow.
