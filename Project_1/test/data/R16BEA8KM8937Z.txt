Before buying, shop around for a good deal!Anyway, as a first time Mom, I had no idea what I was doing when it came to pumping and this pump is really easy to use.  It only has one dial, so no need to fiddle with dials while pumping.  All I do is turn it on and place the cups on my breasts and hold them there until I am done.  The pump automatically switches from letdown mode to regular mode after 2 minutes.  And, if you want you can press a button to switch the modes sooner than that.  I do that sometimes, especially when I single pump.  But when double pumping, it is hard for me to hang on to the collection bottles while playing with buttons and dials.  I can get a good amount of milk in a short amount of time.  Doctor Brown's bottles fit right on, so I don't have to transfer the milk from one bottle to the other and lose all the stuff that gets stuck to the bottle when it is refrigerated.  The motor is a bit loud - I find it distracting when I try to visualize my baby to get let down.  But I have never had a problem letting down and the amount of milk I can collect has been increasing steadily with practice.The first time I used the pump I only got 2-3 oz, but now I get a lot more than that - probably an average of 7 or 8 oz at a time unless it's early morning.  Then I get about 9 or 10 oz in about 8 minutes.You can buy Evenflo brand  breastmilk collection bottles - 4 for $4.99 - instead of the pricey Medela breastmilk storage kit to use as extra collection bottles.Medela customer service is great too - When the Advanced was first manufactured there was a problem with the faceplate coming loose.  This knocked the yellow plug out which caused me to lose suction while pumping.  I called Medela and they overnighted me a new faceplate at no charge.  One thing to note:  I am finding that I want a manual pump as well because a manual pump is more convenient for travel and at home use.  Sometimes, when I'm out without the baby I need to pump and it is just too inconvenient to plug in all the hoses of this pump and use the battery pack.  A manual pump is easier.  The one that comes with the pump is exhausting to use (it's a bicycle horn style pump) so I just ordered a Medela Harmony as well.  I plan to leave this pump at work so I don't have to drag it back and forth.  It is heavy!  I'll just bring the bottles and pump horns back and forth which should be a lot easier.
