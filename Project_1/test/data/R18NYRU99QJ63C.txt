I gave the first book in the series an artificially high 5 stars, and I deducted between 1/2 and 1 whole star from this one due to it's relentless repetition, lack of detail, lack of examples (except the contrived cautionary tales, etc.) and general "rah-rah" tone that continues from the first book.  This is not a valueless book.  It is tiring though, if you already have a basic understanding of investing, the common mathematics used, the time lines involved, and a basic understanding of risk assessment.  When I say "basic", I mean "you get the general idea".  This is a book I could've skipped, though I don't feel dumber for having read it.  It reinforces the "quadrant", outlines that educated guesses are usually lots better than plain-vanilla-guesses, preaches temperance and realistic progression, and most of all, stresses real education and study of the topics at hand.  Investments, finance, accounting, business structures, management, taxation ... whatever you want to start with or specialize in ... are touted as the real material to learn.  Kiyosaki gives you a good shove in the right direction.  You must apply what he says, and not forget there's no free ride.  It's easy to focus on the goal of being rich, and not really follow through with what Kiyosaki recommends about paying dues through education and experience.  Read or don't read this book.  Either way, you have lots of other books to read on the "academic" subjects the author recommends.  Without the repetition, this would be a pretty good book ...DISCLAIMER:  You should know I research and read reviews and excerpts before deciding to invest my time and/or money in a book or product.  Your reviews are helpful to me, and I hope mine are helpful to you too.  That said, after having read your opinions, I find I am consistently satisfied with my purchases, and thus most of my reviews are positive.If I fail to recommend a product/book, and/or fail to explain why I like or dislike it, I have not done you any service.  I will try to cite evidence, facts/contradictions or at least make a case for personal objections or preferences in my reviews.  I appreciate you other reviewers who do the same.  Cheers!
