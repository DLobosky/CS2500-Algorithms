I remember seeing the trailer for this film a while back and thinking, man they finally are making fun of that guy. Made by the people who brought you such classics as "Airplane and The Naked Gun" comes this wonderful work of art, any thing that makes fun of Moore is worth buying. I don't look at this film as a left or right wing production I look at it like a cool play on the Christmas Carol thing, and of course as a great film making fun of Michael. Conservative and liberals alike can laugh at this movie especially since the cast and crew is made up of a mix of both. Our journey starts off with a group of terrorists that are having trouble accomplishing their mission and goals in life, what is a terrorist to do? So they decide that they need the help of Hollywood to get their message across, they need a great director. Enter one Michael Malone [Farley] who is trying to be taken seriously as a filmmaker so he decides to make a feature film, not a documentary. It seems the timing can not be better for the two to come together and make what he thinks is going to be the greatest movie ever made, so the terrorists hire him. So while employed by this group three ghosts come to visit him and try to put him on the straight and narrow. Of course this movie would not be funny if they convince him right off the bat so he argues with them the entire time, comedic genius follows. They are all off as the terrorist are planning to blow up a building full of people and it is up to our unlikely hero to stop them, will he change in time to save them all and stop the terrorists, or will he fail?This movie is very funny regardless of your political ideas; I could care less about democrats/republicans and what they think about movies that make fun of either one of them. I have seen movies that go at both and all I have to say is funny is funny, nuff said. Writer/Director David Zucker and co writers Myrna Sokoloff and Lewis Friedman have written a funny little piece making fun of politics, it is that classic slap stick style that made Zucker's earlier classics so good. Zucker is in full form and this is a step up from some of his stuff before this, even though none of that was horrible. Still the greatest thing about this movie is Kevin Farley's performance, he does a magnificent job in this film. I wish he would be getting a lot more roles because he is just as good as his brother Chris, I still remember that MTV movie "2GETHER" now that was a funny parody film. Any way Kevin does an excellent job as Michael Malone in this and is in all his comedic splendor as he steals the show. Kelsey Grammer as General Patton is just as good and is hilarious in the role as he and Kevin play well off of each other, same can be said for Dennis Hopper as the judge, in fact his part is hilarious due to the Romero like zombie scene. Chriss Anglin plays JFK brilliantly in this movie who is Malone's hero until they meet that is, Jon Voight as George Washington and James Woods are both great in this. Leslie Nielsen is his usual goofy yet funny self in this and love him or hate him Bill O'Reilly is hilarious in this movie. Robert Davi, Serdar Kalsin, and Geoffrey Arend are all great as the terrorists and the lady that played Rosie nearly steals the show. A country singer named Trace Atkins plays the Angel of Death very well and I was glad to see Kevin Sorbo make a guest appearance. It is hard to review a parody film especially one that is a parody of actual people, but I have to say that while this is no were near the best movie ever it is a very enjoyable film. The entire cast and crew of this movie did outstanding jobs and I recommend this movie to all people who do not take themselves seriously all the time. This is not just a movie for republicans/conservatives like it has been said, it is for any one who enjoys comedies.
