I love my Breadman Ultimate! I got mine about three months ago, and have made at least two loaves a week since. The instructions are easy to follow, the resulting loaves of bread are beautiful and delicious, and clean-up is a real snap. Although the manual and other sources have mentioned that the paddle can get stuck in the loaf, that has happened only once to me, and that was one of the three times that I set up the machine to delay bake overnight. (My mother's older Breadman, on the other hand, always bakes the paddle into the bread--I took a look at hers, and they've changed the shape &amp; the fit of the paddle somewhat since.) I've made tasty white, whole wheat, yoghurt, oatmeal, flaxseed, multigrain, cinnamon-raisin, and soy milk breads. I haven't tried doing coffee cake or quick breads in it, yet, nor have I tried making jam in it. I was sceptical of the &quot;French bread&quot; setting, but aside from the shape, the machine produced a tasty, crusty and quite adequate French bread (I used the Breadman French bread recipe that does not call for oil). In addition to the delay timer, I have tried out the programmable settings, and while they are easy to use, the preprogrammed cycles are perfectly sufficient for just about everything I'd do with the machine. One of the other reviewers stated that his breadpan &amp; its replacements leak after just months of use, and I wonder if that is because he soaks it (a no-no) or puts it in the dishwasher (another no-no), since I haven't experienced that problem. My mother's machine, the predecessor of the Ultimate, hasn't had a leak in 4 yrs of 2 or 3x weekly use, and mine hasn't a sign of a leak, either. I haven't bought a loaf of bread since getting the Ultimate, and in addition to the freshness, taste, and nutrition of homemade bread (and knowing the ingredients!), I'm sure it's saving me money. I used to make bread by hand several years ago--for about 3 or 4 years--but I've become too busy to do it on a regular basis any more; I love my Breadman Ultimate! (The &quot;silver&quot; stainless steel looks good on my counter, too, and I prefer the look-and-feel of the metal to the plastic.) I'd definitely recommend the Breadman Ultimate--in silver or not--to anyone looking for a good, reliable bread machine.
