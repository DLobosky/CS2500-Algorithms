The Platinum Edition of The Fellowship of the Ring is absolutely outstanding and definitely worth the money. Here's why:1) The extra 25+ minutes of movie footage adds depth and texture to the story as a whole without making it FEEL longer. The added scenes and segments are seamlessly interwoven with the movie as a whole and are largely comprised of small segments that augment a scene or chapter of the overall story. There is more detail about the hobbits' lives in the Shire, a large section added to the Lorien chapter, and more development of the Fellowship's characters before their journey. Indeed, Jackson and Ian McKellen continue to demonstrate with their work that they were completely robbed at Oscar time.The full run time is more than 3 hours, 20 minutes but the movie is logically split between the first 2 DVDs of the 4-DVD set so that it is easy to view in two sittings (although that is blasphemous in some quarters). Overall, the added scenes make a very good movie MUCH better and further display the excellent direction, cinematography and attention to detail that made the theatrical movie release so good. 2) The DVD extras are very good. The A&E-Biography style Tolkien piece is interesting and pays suitable homage to the author. There are also heretofore unseen interviews with the actors and crew including descriptions of how Peter Jackson put together the movie, how the cast worked together, how the cast members essentially related to each other outside of work as they would while in character (like Liv Tyler being a real princess by making Orlando Bloom drive her in New Zealand because she couldn't stand driving on the left side of the road), etc.3) The insight into the film process -- there is a fine piece on how the director started the film project from concept to the go-ahead from New Line to do three films at once (with credit to Miramax for sheparding the project along for a bit); there is also an outstanding piece on the hobbit doubles -- four small-statured people who dressed as each of the hobbit characters and doubled for them (this was especially useful for eye-level acting so the regular sized characters could affect a natural eye-level for the hobbit actors who were shrunken through editting and camera tricks) and the interesting relationships of the doubles to their primaries.Highly recommended, and unquestionably worth the extra money.
