In other words, it exceeds in its objective which is to give the absolute beginner the very basic grammar, vocabulary and phrases they need to develop confidence and competence in probable real-life situations.  In short, it will not overwhelm even the most timid and is an excellent launch pad to further study.  Is it comprehensive.... absolutely not.... but it delivers on a very good introduction to basic french.Along with this book, I would also consider buying Easy French Step-by-Step.  This is a book for the more serious student and includes vocabulary introduced by order of frequency used, grammar, graded reading material, etc.  If I was only going to buy ONE book... this would be the one and it will last most people a long time.  I also recommend.... Easy French Reader.  This is a popular, inexpensive, entertaining and useful reader to help integrate knowledge.A difficulty for many people with french is pronunciation.  I have found Pronounce It Perfectly in French with Audio CDs (Pronounce It Perfectly CD Packages) to be very helpful in this area.  Another good audio program for pronunciation is SmartFrench Audio CDs  Beginner Level.  There are several levels of these and they are all very good.  The more advanced you get the more you will appreciate the organization of the information.Last, but certainly not least.... I HIGHLY recommend French I, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation).  There are many variations of this that contain more material, but this is the least expensive.  Pimsleur was brilliant and if you really want to load things into long-term memory... dollar-for-dollar this will get the job done and improve your pronunciation and listening at conversational speeds.Lastly, although it is QUITE expensive [[ASIN:B001AFD20E Rosetta Stone Version 3: French Level 1, 2 & 3 Set with Audio Companion] is a very fine resource.  In my opinion, it's worth the expensive because it works... it works quickly and it is one of the most painless ways to get a new language under your belt.  They also sell Level 1 and 2 separately and as a set, but I don't feel these are as good a value as the set.  Also... I would try Pimsleur and seeing if you stick with it before you make this kind of investment.
