Aside from a bit of wandering at about 30 minutes in, the film really moves along at a good pace and, in the end, doesn't seem almost 3 hours long. It's a very enjoyable movie.The bad about this film, the DVD transfer. This is one of the poorest DVD transfers I've seen in a very long time. In fact I'd almost forgotten what compression artifacts looked like. Oh my, they are present in this film. There's about 5 scenes, moderately dark scenes where pixellation is so obvious, it's hard not to be distracted by them. They are at very strange places, not the common problem places (midnight skies full of stars, sunsets or sunrises, inky dark black scenes); no they are at these moderate light level areas. Somebody was just asleep at the wheel during the conversion process. The other bad - this single disc edition. Darn it, there's just the movie, nothing else. So they've used the full almost 9Gb of resolution for the film (no director commentary, very few previews, and only spanish and french alternate soundtracks), and they've managed to muck up the transfer - shame on the dvd manufacturer.The great - this movie. Oh yes I enjoyed it. Brad Pitt is wonderful. He actually manages a credible New Orleans accent that he keeps consistent through the film. Kate Blanchett, oh what an incredibly gorgeous actress. Those blue piercing eyes. Probably the role of a lifetime for her. Queen, oh she had some of the best lines in the film. I loved her so much. And the man that is struck by lightning 7 times - yes he finally does tell the 7th time - the clips are actually very funny.  The mediocre - this is a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Several years ago Salon dot com offered this and many other Fitzgerald short stories as a download. Bill Irwin, a wonderful voice talent reads this story on that edition. It seems that the script writers took some liberties with the story and tried to modernize it a bit. This is actually where I think the film falls apart a bit. The Katrina backdrop was a bit needless. The floating back and forth between Caroline, Daisy's daughter, reading the story and Benjamin, Brad Pitt, telling the story in his own words was a bit hokey. Blending the two voices together was not very good. Caroline, played by Julia Ormond, does not have a very good reading voice. Brad Pitt is infinitely better. The other bits I didn't care for as much were the blending in of the Great Gatsby here and there, that sense of there's the haves and the have nots. The have nots will always look up to the haves. And poor Benjamin is an orphan, so he must be envious of the haves. Overall this is a very touching love story between Benjamin and Daisy. I'm certain you've read or heard all about this film. It's all true and all wrong. It's a long movie that is a pleasure to watch. There are some good funny moments, and you'll be touched by the film. Technically, the sound is outstanding. So many moments where the room felt like those things were really happening. The cinematography is very good. Kate Blanchett is in gorgeous light all the time, and her eyes stand out more than I've ever seen in an actress (short of Venessa Redgrave in Blow Up; or Jacquline Bisset in Day for Night). The pacing is generally good. It might have been better to edit down the first half hour or hour - tighten things up about 15 minutes. Rated PG-13. There's one f-bomb for those counting. There's a few scenes with prostitutes (no nudity), and several references to going to brothels. There's a bit of violence on the tugboat where several men are killed. Overall, if this had been a foreign film with subtitles, the MPAA would have rated it R, hands down. But since it's Brad Pitt and an American production, it got a PG-13, just barely. It's The Great Gatsby meets Forrest Gump without the speech problem; overlayed with a beautiful love story. This is a movie well worth watching and committing the time to watch.
