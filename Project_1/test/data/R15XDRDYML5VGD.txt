"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Blamed for the terrorist bombing of the Kremlin, IMF operative Ethan Hunt is disavowed along with the rest of the agency when the President initiates "Ghost Protocol". Left without any resources or backup, Ethan must find a way to clear his agency's name and prevent another attack. To complicate matters further, Ethan is forced to embark on this mission with a team of fellow IMF fugitives whose personal motives he does not fully know.The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Ethan Hunt, who also produced) is excellent. The directing by Brad Bird is excellent. The story & screenplay by Josh Appelbaum & Andre Nemec is excellent.The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is excellent. The film editing by Paul Hirsch is excellent. The casting by April Webster & Alyssa Weisberg is excellent. The production design by James Bissell is excellent. The art direction by Michael Diner, Helen Jarvis, Christa Munro, Michael Turner, Martin Vackar & Grant Van Der Slagt is excellent. The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg, Andronico Del Rosario & Elizabeth Wilcox is excellent. The costume design by Michael Kaplan is excellent. The visual effects & animation by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) is excellent. The make-up effects creation by David LeRoy Anderson is excellent.This is an excellent action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. This is the best movie in the "Mission: Impossible" franchise, thus far. This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies in years. This is also one of the best action films, if not, the best action film of last year.
