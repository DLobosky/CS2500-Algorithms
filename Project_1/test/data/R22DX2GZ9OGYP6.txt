They also seem to come off (at least soon after applied) without leaving "goo" on your screen. What I'm less crazy about is the surface of the protector is not as "smooth" as many. So with a touch screen phone, your finger sort of "sticks" a bit more rather the gliding easily. It's like squeaky clean glass versus glass with a slight oily film. It takes some getting used to and I'm not sure I like it.The bad news with any of these is even one tiny piece of dust, lint, etc. will create an obvious air bubble that you can't get rid of. So not only do you need to get the screen perfectly clean, but you need to keep anything from sticking to the underside of the protector as the backing is peeled off when you apply it. This is easier said than done if the air is dry as, being plastic, the protector builds up a static charge and attracts dust. So you might want to apply it on a damp day and don't stir up any dust in the area when you do it. Make sure the protective plastic on the protector is also clean so dust so it doesn't end up on the screen when you apply it. The dust issue is true of all of the peel and stick protectors. So I can't really fault Empire for that. Most LG Optimus protectors have a notch to the left of the speaker at the top and this one does too. Others have said this is necessary for a sensor that's under that area but I suspect there's a similar phone with a front facing camera there and the notch lets them use the same protector on more phones? But needed, or not, it's not that noticeable.
