However, Nora Titone's My Thoughts Be Bloody:  The Bitter Rivalry Between Edwin and John Wilkes Booth That Led to an American Tragedy is the most well written and comprehensive book yet to be written about the actor-brothers.Any book about Edwin and John Wilkes Booth must begin with their father.  Junius Brutus Booth was one of the best Shakespearian actors in Britain, and his life had more high-drama than any play in which he starred.  In 1821, he left behind a wife and young son to travel to America with his pregnant mistress.  He settled down on a farm in Maryland, where he and mistress, Mary Ann Holmes, produced ten children.  Junius took to drink, which made him erratic and undependable when touring.  With so many children to care for, Mary Ann sent 12-year-old Edwin to serve as caretaker for his father.  At the same time, Edwin learned his father's craft from the master.  By the time Edwin was 17, he replaced his father playing Richard III and the torch was passed.  Meanwhile, while Edwin was on the road, John Wilkes remained at home where he was pampered and spoiled by his mother.  As a teenager, John Wilkes made the decision to become an actor.  Although he had no formal training, he had rugged good looks.  Edwin was well established as an actor by this time, so he set the ground rules for his younger brother.  "Edwin split the map of the United States in two, practically along the Mason-Dixon Line as it turned out, though his intentions had everything to do with business and not politics.  Each brother, Edwin said, would claim one region in which to practice his profession, with the understanding that neither would cross into the other's territory.  This plan, which would shape the course of John Wilkes's future and sow lasting seeds of conflict in the Booth family, had worked before."  Contrary to popular belief, John Wilkes was not a talented actor and many of his reviews are scathing.  "Aside from good looks and an athletic ability, he had little to recommend him to audiences.  It was evident this Booth had never been trained to breathe, to project his voice, or to speak in a way that conveyed emotion.  Shakespeare was a foreign language to him."Titone takes us through the planning of Lincoln's assassination, and how this act affected both brothers.  I do wish that Titone had included John Wilkes' diary entries from his time on the run, as they reflect his sense of outrage that his efforts were not praised by Southerners.  The writings also show what an egomaniac he was (perhaps thanks to his doting mother).  Lincoln's assassination devastated the Union-loyal Edwin and for a spell, he gave up acting.  But he couldn't stay away for too long, and eventually, returned to the stage.  Edwin Booth has been called the best Shakespearian actor from the second half of the 19th Century.  In addition to his acting, he also managed several theatres and founded the famous Players Club, which is still in operation at Grammercy Park in NYC.  "In generations of mythmaking about Lincoln's killer, Edwin's own name and story were lost, leaving John Wilkes to stand alone on the stage of national memory, as he no doubt would have wished."  Hopefully, Titone's wonderful book will help correct this.
