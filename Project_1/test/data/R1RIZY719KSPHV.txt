One-Hundred percent intuitive! Not just a mouse, it is a track pad, jester sensor and allows one to right click! This mouse may seem pricy but I honestly feel it is worth the price, with its elegant design tt feels so natural in your hand (I do have smaller hands) and of course it is so intuitive to use. I purchased this with the Apple Magic Trackpad and Apple Wireless Keyboard. The mouse allows for precise drawing and easier right clicking when needed. Yes I know these are pricy toys, but for a must have die hard MAC fan you will love them! Very easy to sync and great battery life too. Please make sure to keep the boxes they come in for storage and travel!
