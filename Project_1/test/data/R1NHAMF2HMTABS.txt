The neckstrap is so bulky it makes it hard to tuck the camera in your purse or pocket. I recommend buying an inexpensive wrist strap for it, like the Nikon AN-CP19 Replacement Strap.    Also, the GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector for Leica D-lux 4 and Panasonic Lx-3 Digital Cameras shows up as "frequently bought together" with the LX-5, but it doesn't quite fit.  It's not quite wide enough, and a little too high. You can put it on if you remove the hot shoe cover (then put the hot shoe cover back on over it), but it blocks that little connection socket on the back of the camera, below the hot shoe. I believe it's used to plug in the optional external viewfinder.I am not planning to use an external viewfinder, or the hotshoe, for that matter, so I can live with it.  But I wish I'd bought the GGS Optical Glass DSLR LCD Screen Protector for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX5 / LX3 and Leica D-LUX4 instead.  I have a feeling it might fit better.  (Haven't actually tried it, but since it's actually made for the LX-5, seems like a better bet.)Some people find the lens cap annoying. If you turn on the camera without taking off the lens cap, you get a screen telling you to take off the lens cap, then press any button. If you want a faster start, there's an "exploding petal" lens cap from a third party vendor.  It opens automatically when the lens extends. The drawback is this type of lens cap offers less protection than the usual type against dust, etc.  But if you're buying this as an "always with me" camera, and often pull it out to take photos on the fly, the petal lens cap is worth a look.
