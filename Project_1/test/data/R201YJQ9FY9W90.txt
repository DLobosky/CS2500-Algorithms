This PDA has served me well for many months.  Several years ago the medical schedule that was prescribed for me became very difficult for me to manage. Frequently I would forget a dose of medicine or overlook a required activity. After numerous missed doses, my doctors asked me to get a PDA. My occupational therapist recommended this HP PDA to help me manage my medicine and regimen.While working with the HP iPAQ 211, I found that most operations are easy.  After a short time I entered the times and doses for each of my medicines.  This PDA allows a person to set an alarm that is tough to ignore (my wife can hear it two rooms away).  If I ignore the alarm this machine will remember and remind me occasionally until I mark that the required event has occurred.   In addition to helping manage my schedule, the HP PDA has several other features: A calendar, a notepad to keep track of tasks that need to be preformed, a calculator, and games.  There are probably more features that I have not noticed as I use the PDA only  to manage my appointments, my schedule, and my tasks.      The operation of this PDA is smooth and easy, once a person learns about it.  A very nice CD, that functions on your computer, accompanies the PDA.  The CD not only teaches PDA operation, but also sets up a connection with your PC to allow even easier management of your activities.    I highly recommend the HP iPAQ 211 Enterprise for anyone interested in a simple instrument to help manage their activities.
