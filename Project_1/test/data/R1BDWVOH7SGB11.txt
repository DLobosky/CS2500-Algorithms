But, on the other hand, it's better than some other anime schlock I've seen recently. Somehow, the end seemed anti-climactic and a bit 'odd' (aside from the nudity that didn't really appear to serve any purpose, which was also odd fan-service in my opinion). The story itself was interesting enough, and the animation was alright. It was an overly-action oriented story (there was a little, but it was peripheral to the story). I guess it's one of those "classic" bits that's hard to categorize. I'd say it's worth getting and watching. Maybe a rental unless you find yourself really "into to." Of course, for the price (~$10), you might as well buy it (only a few bucks more than renting, and you can re-sell it if you want to).So, kind of a mixed bag. I gave it 4 stars because it was interesting and 'above average' with decent animation. Can't give it 5 stars, however, on account of it was a bit odd and the ending didn't quite seem 'complete'. To each their own.
