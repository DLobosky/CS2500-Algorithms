

The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative. Better constructed stories on similar dystopic  themes are  The Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks), Between Planets, Citizen of the Galaxy.
