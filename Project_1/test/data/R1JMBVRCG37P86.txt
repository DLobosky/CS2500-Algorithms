I don't think that the characters were as well rounded as I normally like, but then again it may be that this isn't the first of the series and they assume that you read The Fisher Boy.However, I really liked the way that the mystery and drama unfurled throughout the book. So much that I actually read this book in one sitting.I think I will go back and read the first book. Just to see if I get a better perspective on the characters.In conjunction with the Wakela's World Disclosure Statement, I received a product in order to enable my review.
