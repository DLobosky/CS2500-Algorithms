Spraying dicamba anywhere around shallow rooted trees/shrubs WILL kill them! Beware of wind drift too!- This is POWERFUL stuff!Weed spray"s" without dicamba, just didn't work for me!? SpeedZone rep recommended 1.8oz per gallon (NO MORE!).Spectracide Weed Stop also has dicamba, but you'd have to use it 4x... to get the same stregnth PBI recommended? (SpeedZone is way too expensive, if you can find it!) ~~~~~~~~~~My TIPS for killing weeds with a hand sprayer (all brands, Roundup too...! User beware!)!-1. Use a COMMERCIAL non-foaming "Surfactant" at the recommended 1/8 cup (1oz/ 2tbsp) per gallon (most farm supply stores... have it!)!  NOT dish soap (read the edu... test reports!)! a. Summer weeds... have a Thick protective wax on the leaves, and you can see the surfactant cutting the wax (letting the spray soak in (translucent!))!  It also helps the spray to stick...!2. I flattened a stainless army fork, and sharpened the ends with a grinder/file...I then duck taped it to the end of my spray wand, with the tines 1/4" past the nozzle end.Give a 1sec spray at base first! I then use this to agitate/scrub the leaves  (both sides!), while barely spraying. 3. NO mowing 5-7days before spraying (Partial growth= Partial kill!), and 3days+ after (watch for weed TopKill...?)!4. Water lawn HEAVILY the day before Spraying, and NOT again for "48hrs+"!!!All that sales hype about waterproof in X... hrs, is NONSENSE (all brands!)!a. We all know if you want it to rain, just wash your car!- Well this goes Double for me with weed spraying [...]!    :o(5. No spraying when less than 60f, or over  80f (burns lawn!)!  Never late in the afternoon (weeds dormant)!6. If I have a stubborn weed with a tap root (careful around shrubs...!)!- I stick an 8"  #2 Phillips screwdriver into the ground right next to it. I then give  a "1sec!" spray down the hole (no more, or you WILL have a HUGE brown spot...!).BTW!- You might want to try my tips first on an obscure part of your lawn, as brown spots are "slow" to fill back in (I'm going to re-seed spots next Spring!)!BTW2- Seems to kill MUCH better in the Spring!? Takes several re-applications in the summer!Any tips would be appreciated!?
