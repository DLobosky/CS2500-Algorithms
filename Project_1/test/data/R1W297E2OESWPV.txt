I picked this cd up not really know what it was, but thinking it looked really interesting.  The vocals are great as is the feel of the album.  Its very mellow without being boring.  I don't really have much patience for slow tracks but this album was really interesting and different.  A few of the songs are just amazing.  I'd highly recomend it to anyone looking for something a little different, but still comfortable.
