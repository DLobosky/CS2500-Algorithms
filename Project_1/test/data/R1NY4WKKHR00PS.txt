Showed them that any time is the right time to talk to Jesus ...whether they want to thank him or ask for forgiveness. The illustrations are very nice, and the kids enjoyed looking at it. Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free through The B & B Media Group, Inc. book review bloggers program.
