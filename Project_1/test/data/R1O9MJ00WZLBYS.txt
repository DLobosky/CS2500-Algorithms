Wisconsin, thanks to efforts made by faculty and students in the last few years, gains were made in restoring some degree of free speech and other Bill-of-Rights protections to faculty and students.  In the other two, Columbia and Berkeley, no such efforts have been made and the status quo continues.  The author states that most or all other campuses resemble the latter two.  Also, in introductory chapters, the author gives a precis of what has happened to colleges and universities since 1987: (1) the redefinition of the mission of the university from the search for truth and knowledge to the transforming of individuals into sensitive members of the community from whom all racism, sexism and homophobia has been washed away.  (2) the redefinition of speech as action.  One doesn't state an opinion, one offends another person or harasses another person.  So, codes against harassment and creating a hostile environment include saying anything of which the censors disapprove.  (3) "critical race theory", the view that racism is endemic to liberal society and that such notions as individual, reason, merit, etc. are racist notions and should be suppressed.The author, like many others, states that the motive for the de facto repeal of the Bill of Rights at universities was that the welfare of some groups was more important.  He goes on to point out that the consequences have been anything but beneficial, even to those groups.  Feelings of antagonism have increased.  An increasing infantilization or dependency of the favored groups has occurred.  etc.  The author cites a number of other interesting recent books, including McWhorter, Losing the Race; Wood, Diversity; Kuran, Private Truths, Public Lies; Farber and Sherry, Beyond All Reason; and Kors and Silvergate, The Shadow University.  Kors and Silvergate have continued to be active in the area and have established an organization called Foundation for Individual Freedom in Education (FIRE) with a website, www.thefire.org, where complaints can be registered.  The site makes interesting if harrowing reading.  There is also a database in which you can look up any college and get FIRE's rating of the degree of freedom on that campus.  One strength of the book is its narrow focus.  That means, however, that other books need also to be consulted.  The book is especially weak on the causes or development of the present situtation.  The author states that he became a faculty member in the mid-1980s as a result of having written an anti-Nazi book (PhDs looking for faculty positions, take note!).  By that time, the situation had already developed.  For an eyewitness account in narrative form of the groups and motives that led to the present situation, see The Rape of Alma Mater.  For a detailed study of the situation at the present time, one which includes other parts of society that are affected by what is happening in academia, read While America Sleeps: How ... and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within -- While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within.The present book is unique in sounding a hopeful note and in providing others with the two cases of (limited) success.  It is to be hoped that other academics and students will read this book and learn how to take back their own universities.
