Sadler is able to capture the character of Casca very well in this one and developes other character or character types that will appear in later novels.  The story is fast moving, yet detailed.  The nice thing about the Casca books, is that after the first one is read, you really do not have to read them in order, each book is a good story within itself.  Again, as with most of his novels, Sadler has done a wonderful bit of reasearch.  This is certainly true of this one.  The few errors he did make were of little moment.  Very much recommend this one.
