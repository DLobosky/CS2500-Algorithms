I recently had a bad experience with this range extender: Diamond Multimedia 300Mbps 802.11n Wireless Range Extender (WR300N), so I returned it and ordered this Netgear unit instead.I just installed it and, wow, what a different experience! Extremely simple and quick installation, at least if your router has WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup). No CD or access to a webpage needed. It was as simple as pushing the WPS button on the router, pushing the WPS button on the range extender, and bingo, it's up and running. The new network has the same name as the original one, with "_EXT" at the end. I'm now getting excellent signal strength in the room where it was marginal before. Seems like the small adjustable antennas are a good idea, and the white color blends in well with our decor. Couldn't be more pleased with this product - nice job, Netgear!
