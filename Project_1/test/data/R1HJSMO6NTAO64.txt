This is more of a recap of the previous videos but will also stand alone and be just as worthwhile as a teaching tool. You will get a lot of excellent information and be skiing better after just one viewing. The approach to skiing is very mellow, the scenery and music in the video are very beautiful and quite relaxing. The skills and techniques are amazingly simple to master and your skiing should improve considerably. When you hit the mountains you will incorporate the techniques from the video and be sking better from the get-go. It's an awesome feeling to gently glide down even the more difficult slopes.
