No it's not as good as the movies & it's not as intense as the Samurai Jack-esk `Clone Wars' shorts from 2003 but then again it's NOT supposed to be like ANY of those. It's like comparing apples to oranges. ALSO keep in mind that Lucas is trying to broaden his appeal to kids with this movie's style & story telling as well as with the series on CTN so it's going to be, over all, a bit more simple in its execution but no less entertaining. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar performance. It is a CGI CARTOON! how frick'n serious/ critical are you supposed to take it? The action has more of an Episode 2 feel to it, for me at least, but the action sequences are just as long, fun & still `edgy' for a kid's CGI cartoon. They flowed well & were non-stop action. Clone troopers got it pretty bad in this movie and the lightsaber fights left me wanting more. They were pretty good for CGI though. It held my interest. The dialogue could have used a little help but what star wars movie couldn't? I wouldn't recommend buying this movie until you see it first but if you keep in mind the target audience is more kid than adult & remember what this movie is supposed to be/ do & you don't take it as seriously as some, then you should have fun & you'll be just fine.  Anakin's apprentice is there for the young girls as well as to be the little miss know it all pain in the butt for Anakin the way he was to Ben (it's called irony). She does shoot her mouth off a bit much so she may be a bit annoying for some out there (I didn't find her that annoying but she could use some work) but comparable to jar jar? Not even close.`TCW' story line isn't a major one in the Star Wars universe; it feels more like a made for TV movie, but it does initiate the TV series so there is a broader story to set up here as well. Simple, aims at a broader audience (hint.... kids) & still a fun watch, if only once, in my opinion.I say rent it first, watch it for what it is & go from there.
