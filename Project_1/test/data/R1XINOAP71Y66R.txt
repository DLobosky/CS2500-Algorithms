Both lasted less than 6 months (the paper carrier quit working on this one; the the thing that travels back and forth to print, broke on my other one.)Also, the ink tanks holds little ink.  You will go broke keeping this thing in ink.The WiFi also was poor at connecting to other computers.Since I owned two of these and neither lasted 6 months, this thing gets a 1 rating.  I would give it a zero, but that wasn't available.This is sad really, as the first Epson printer I ever bought lasted over 10 years.  That is why I bought the Epson brand again.  But, apparently, Epson now just makes junk.  I will never buy another Epson.
