I made a series of identical shots, on a tripod, in camera RAW on an A580, going back and forth between the two lenses with the camera on full manual.  I took the camera body back to my rented condo (in Destin FL), and compared on my computer, working strictly in RAW (avoiding any sharpening by the camera or by my software and avoiding jpeg artifacts).  I zoomed in to identical magnification at identical original focal lengths at identical f-numbers. I honestly didn't want it to be better than my beloved 16-105, just because I didn't want to spend the money, and I'd rather have the wider zoom range on hand when needed.  The bad news for me was that it out-performed the 16-105 in sharpness and in color.  The improvement wasn't stunning, but it was there when you looked for it.  Did I have to look hard to see it?  Actually, I did have to look very closely to see it, but it was always there.  Please understand that I know and understand what constitutes good optical performance.  I have the Zeiss 24-70, the G70-300, and the 50 F4, as well as the legendary Minolta 17-35.  (In my film days I shot Hassleblad and Nikon as well as testing Leica-M.)One reviewer said the vignetting was a problem.  I can see slight darkening in the corners on my A580, but I wouldn't notice if I weren't looking for it.  The same reviewer said he could see a slim B+W 62mm filter.  I have a slim B+W XS-PRO nano 62mm, and I see no evidence of the filter if I screw the filter in all the way without tightening.  One reviewer on Amazon said the build quality was poor, and I've read that complaint from others on the web.  I'd rate the build quality as no better than the 16-105, but not nearly as good as the 24-70, which is in a class by itself anyway.  This lens is far, far, far better than the A580 kit lens in build quality, which is the worst I've ever encountered, although the kit lens optics are quite respectable.  Zeiss put the money in the optics on this lens.  Did Zeiss actually manufacture the lens, or did Sony (or some third party) build it to Zeiss specs?  I have no idea.  You can bet Zeiss wouldn't let it go out with their logo if it weren't to their specs.I bought the lens after doing the test, and I'll tell you why.  I was thinking that I'd get an A77 when they came out.  The A77's high-pixel-density sensor makes demands on optics.  I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to be better prepared for the A77 while I could get the lens at a bargain price.  Is it worth the money that you'd have to pay?  Compared to the 16-105, I'd have to say it's a wash.  You give up some zoom range, and in return you get a bit better optical performance and a bit more aperture at 80mm.  Some have said, "What is Zeiss coming to?"  I say that Zeiss is giving you exactly what you pay for.  This is a very low price for a Zeiss lens.Is this the right lens for you?  Should you opt for the 16-105 or maybe the Sony 18-250?  The prices are all about the same.  I have all three lenses.  They have similar vignetting characteristics.  The 18-250 has more barrel distortion owing to its extreme zoom range, but that's correctable with software.  The Sony 18-250, while not having the sharpness or chromatic excellence of this lens, sets a new standard super-zoom optical quality.  If I were only going to have one lens for anything other than the A77 or A67, I'd probably want the 16-105 as a good compromise between optical quality and versatility.  If I were going for the A66/77, I'd get the Zeiss, both for the sharpness and for the slightly wider aperture.  (The A66/77 translucent mirror costs about a half-stop worth of light, but DxO says the sensor surprisingly seems to lose nothing significant in low-light performance.)I don't think you'll go wrong with this lens or one of the Sony alternatives.  I didn't give five stars, because of the build quality, but the build quality is more than good enough.  Good luck with your decision!Tim Naff
