I won't go over the details of each workout since Nancy has done such a great job with that, but here are my thoughts on the DVD.  Upper Body Weights:I really enjoyed this segment. If you have the Body Sculpt DVD and use the upper body weight segment from it, this would be a good option to add some variety.  I love the 10 minute sessions as I tend to neglect my upper body in my workouts, but it is easy to squeeze this in.  If you are looking to make it more difficult, simply add more weight.  Easier? Simply use lighter weights.  You can also do the second segment.  I will also add - I'm in physical therapy currently for my knee so avoid doing standing weights.  I was able to complete the majority of the workout while sitting on the edge of a chair. UPDATE: Since there have been some comments about the upper body segments being too easy, I thought it would be helpful to include the amount of weight I am using.  I had been lax on my upper body workouts lately so I did this the first two times with 3 lb weights, but now am using 5 lb weights. In the past when I did upper body weights all the time (but not using their DVD), I usually used 10 or 11 lb weights. So, if 5 lbs becomes easy, I will increase the weight to 7 or 8 lbs, etc. The exercises in this routine are traditional exercises just nicely combined into a 10 minute segment. Upper Body with Resistance Band:This is the only segment I have not tried as I was afraid it might bother my knee. Abdominals with Resistance Band:Abdominal Curl with Leg Variations:I really enjoyed these and did both of them together.  Although there is a simiilarity between their ab routines, I think these are different enough to make this DVD worth purchasing even if you have the other ones.  I really like the Core Fusion ab routines, and since I also have Pilates Plus and Body Sculpt I like that this will give me additional variety.  I try to use one of their ab routines three times a week. I think if you do the same routine all the time, your body gets used to it. This shakes things up just enough. UPDATE:  The last time I did these two, I did them together again, but I dropped the resistance band for the leg variations segment.  It worked just fine without it.  Upper Body, Back & Hip Stretches:Wow - I really liked this stretch routine as I do all of their stretch routines.  I also have hip dysplasia and as a result it can be painful at times.  I really try to work on flexibility for my lower back and hips, and their routines are perfect.  I've used this routine a couple times when my hip was a little sore and it felt much better after. BONUS segments:- flat back/rounded back from the Pilates Plus DVD- 8 minute routine from Shiva Rea's Creative Core DVD (I had fun doing this one after the first Core Fusion ab routine.)- NEW 5 minute back routine.  This works on both stretches and strength.  It is short, but effective. I also give this routine a top rating.If you have Pilates Plus and Body Sculpt and enjoy those, I think this would a good addition and provide some additional variety.  If you are new to Core Fusion, the ab routines are quite different than traditional ones with lots of crunch reps. Core Fusion has very long holds, but is very effective.
