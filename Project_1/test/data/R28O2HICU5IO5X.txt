The book is worth buying for this alone. Much of the book is devoted to historical analysis of events over the last few decades in Chile, Argentina, Russia, and the like. I don't have enough background in the recent history of these countries to be certain how much of what Klein describes is accurate.  Her analysis strikes me as plausible enough, though, to be worth serious consideration at the very least.  I have a long-standing interest in economics, so that I feel qualified to comment on Klein's approach.  Klein is quite correct that modern mainstream economics has lost its way.  Mainstream economics worships the global free market, in the face of a remarkable lack of evidence that worldwide free markets make ordinary citizens happier or more prosperous.  For more on this, I would suggest Robert Lane's book The Loss of Happiness in Market Democracies.  Most economic development schemes today assume that the best way to develop an economy is through increasing long-distance export and import.  Unfortunately, basing a local economy on long-distance shipment of goods leaves a country's prosperity completely vulnerable to events occurring thousands of miles away. It also undermines local social cohesion, which is based in large part on local economic interdependence. The doctrine of comparative advantage, which is drummed into every first-year economics student today, takes none of this into account.  I have no quarrel with the idea that some government regulations are stupid and destructive.  Some are.  Unfortunately, many of today's politicians and economists are too lazy to do the necessary work to sort out which regulations are good and which bad.  Therefore they want to toss out all government regulation and privatize as many government functions as possible. This idea is more dangerous than many people realize.  Taken to an extreme, it is essentially feudalism. One of Klein's main points is that for any country's economy, rapid change is usually extremely destructive.  This is true even if the changes are valuable and necessary in themselves.  I think Klein is convincing here.  Klein does miss some things.  She puts too much emphasis on GDP as a measure of economic prosperity.  The problem with GDP is that it is calculated essentially by counting up what people spend.  GDP ignores population increases, the drawdown of natural resources, and declining quality of life.  GDP is essentially the corporate view of what an economy should be like. Ordinary people should feel free to ignore GDP statistics.  Klein is correct that often the people do know better than corporations what they need. Unfortunately, in some cases the people have had the wool pulled over their eyes by corporations for so long that corporate-friendly policies are more popular than they should be. While Klein does not mention this, an example is the long-standing love affair of the American people with the automobile.  Automobiles are great for corporations.  Corporations build cars, parking lots, and highways.  Unfortunately, a transportation system based largely on cars is extremely destructive to American cities, to social and family life, and even to government, which subsidizes cars to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars every year.  Worse, this corporate-friendly transportation system has resulted in making the country utterly dependent on ever-shrinking oil reserves.  For more on this, see James Kunstler's books The Geography of Nowhere: The Rise and Decline of America's Man-Made Landscape and The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century, and Donald Shoup's book The High Cost of Free Parking.  Overall, though, Klein's book should not be missed. Read it even if you don't agree.
