I will say Thank You for all those people who left comments on my review of the documentary called: The Atheism Tapes which was Wrongfully Deleted. I Will NOT be posting anymore Reviews on Amazon.com! I WILL Only be responding to comments and that is all I will be doing here on Amazon.com! Thanks again.)I bought the 3-Disc Edition of Superman Returns from Circuit City. I have to say that Superman Returns is gorgeous visually. My favorite scenes are (1)the saving of the plane/jet, (2)the automatic gun bouncing bullets, (3)Metropolis mayhem and (4)falling hero. Superman Returns is like Superman: The Movie and Superman III of course without any super villain(s) like you see in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Superman Returns is a buy or at least a rent.
