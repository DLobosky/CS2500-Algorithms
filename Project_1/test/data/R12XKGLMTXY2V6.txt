This movie had a great premise, and the story itself was unique and interesting. With the right screenplay, the story would have really shone. However, some parts of the story were rather flimsy, and the ending... meh. If the story was significantly adjusted in some parts, then the movie would have stood a serious chance. As it is now... no. Definitely rent this movie, for me it was hard enough watching just once.I would however recommend that you watch the alternate ending. I actually liked it better than the 'real' ending.
