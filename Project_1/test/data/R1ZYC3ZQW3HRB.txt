The discs in this set will not play right on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. The sound cuts out constantly and you have to keep hitting pause then play to hear a few more seconds of audio before it happens again. I sent back the set and got a replacement, but the new ones did the same thing. I took my Blu Ray player back and got a different model, but the problem was even worse! I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of Season 5 instead.
