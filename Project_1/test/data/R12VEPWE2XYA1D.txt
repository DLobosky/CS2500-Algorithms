This work by Andrew Gih (Ji) can now be viewed as little more than a curio. Gih was one of the leading indigenous pastors to emerge from Republican China and as part of the Bethel Evangelistic Band had some of the more storied histories of any Christian leader in China. This book in particular is a collection of his thoughts on the state of the world during the early years of the Cold War and how Christians should be preparing for the possible outcomes of global tensions. While the content of the book has little contemporary relevance, it does provide an intriguing look into both the life and thought of a fascinating individual who was so central to the emergence of a truly indigenous Chinese church during the first half of the twentieth century.
