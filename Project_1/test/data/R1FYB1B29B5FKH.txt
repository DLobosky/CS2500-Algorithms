I have had this book for sometime just sitting on my bookshelf. I picked it up this week looking for something different and light to read.  I was pleasantly surprised by this writer who is new to me.  There is humor and a mystery of course and dogs galore!  There is some romance and I liked the idea of the series starting out with Jack already being involved with Jamie instead of having to go through the beginning of the relationship and building on that as books where  the romance is more the main theme.  (I was looking for something different and this was definitely it).  I am a dog lover (have a Chocolate Lab and a Bichon/Poodle mix)so enjoyed the dog training hints (though at times couldn't follow the concept).  I liked all the characters which is rare for me especially since there were several in this book and at times got them confused.  I just don't have anything negative to say about the book.  I just really enjoyed it. I ordered the rest of the books in the series from Amazon and anxiously awaiting them to arrive.  I hope Mr Kelley continues to write books like this.  I don't know how long he can keep the Jack Field Series going but something similar would be great.
