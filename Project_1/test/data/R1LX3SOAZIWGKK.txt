The Syndicate, was a modern version rock band that had closer ties to The Doors of 1967, than Duran Duran of 1984. But, as many popular bands of the eighties were all smoke and mirrors and had little substance, The Dream Syndicate was all but ignored by most. It is a case of the right band at exactly the wrong time.And how did a furry beast like myself, travel down the same path as these majestic misfits? Well, I bumped into this group in an old fashioned manner. As I was struck in the gut by their live show as openers for R.E.M. at the notorious, (and well-documented) gig in Virginia Beach, Va on a hot summer's night in 1984.For me, it felt like these guys were bringing the 1960's (in sound & spirit) right at us in the middle of thoe horrible days of Reaganomics. I had discovered new music that kicked A$$! Led by Steve Wynn on guitars and vocals, Karl Precoda on wild outta control lead guitars, Dennis Duck & Dave Provost holding down the bottom on drums and bass guitar duties. As an added bonus, Tom Zwoncheck plays some amazing keyboards on this album."Still Holding On To You" "Daddy's Girl" "Bullet With My Name On It" "John Coltrane Stereo Blues" and the title track: "Medicine Show" are great stompin' rock songs, that don't let up.This is hard-driving music that is best played loud to drown out the neighbor's dog. This music didn't receieve the huge audience that it deserved, I don't think "Medicine Show" got anywhere near the top-200 album listings. Everybody else wanted: "Thriller."But wait eager shoppers, there's more!Some smart person has added almost all of the follow-up live recording from one of Dream Syndicate's summer 1984 shows as support to R.E.M.That jewell entitled: "This Is Not The New Dream Synicate Album...LIVE!" is here (with the exception of: "John Coltrane Stereo Blues" that wouldn't fit here due to the time constraints of this CD.) But, three tracks from: "Medicine Show" and the fantastic set opener" "Tell Me When It's Over" are now included after the end of the studio renditions. And these live versions are here for good reason, as they show just what the band does to them on stage. The live tunes are larger than their studio relatives, and with the sonic-assault of this music blasting outta your speakers, you may forget to clean those dirty dishes still in the sink from last Tuesday!This great recording should be heard by anyone who enjoys great rock music. It's one of the great albums of the 1980's. And it's back in print, and available once again so you don't have to shell out over $100.00 to hear this music from the vendors that tagged it an "collector's item" and want to drain your bank account.Get it while it remains in print, (that might be a very short time!)Four & 1/2 Stars!!!
