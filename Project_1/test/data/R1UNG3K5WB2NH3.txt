THIS ONE WAS RECORDED BACK IN THE EARLY 90'S WHEN YOU HAD THE TRANSITIONAL LINE-UP WHICH INCLUDED CUSTER ON DRUMS, ED KING ON GUITAR, AND RANDALL HALL ON GUITAR. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE MEMEBERS WHO ARE STILL IN THE LINE-UP - JOHNNY VAN ZANT, GARY ROSSINGTON, THE LATE LEON WILKESON, AND BILLY POWELL.IT CONSISTS OF 10 GREAT SONGS, SOME HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE: "GOOD LOVIN'S HARE TO FIND", "ONE THING", "CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY", "THE LAST REBEL" (THIS ONE IS ABOUT - A CONFERATE SOLDER, AND GARY ROSSINGTON), "OUTTA HELL IN MY DODGE", "KISS YOUR FREEDOM GOODBYE", "SOUTH OF HEAVEN", "LOVE DON'T ALWAYS COME EASY", AND "BORN TO RUN" (THIS IS NOT THE BRUCE SPRINGSTEN SONG - THIS ONE IS MUCH BETTER AND IS VERY UPBEAT - JOHNNY DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB ON LEAD VOCALS ON THIS ONE ("BORN TO RUN, CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THE GOOD LORD HAS DONE FOR ME...").WELL AS I DESCRIBED ABOVE, EVERY SONG IS A HIGHLIGHT, THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS ONE GREAT ALBUM CD.THIS IS A GREAT ONE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!
