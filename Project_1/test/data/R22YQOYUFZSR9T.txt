This is one of my favorite horror sequels of all time and to me is the best in the Halloween series. The origional was good, but this one... WOW! There's just not enough good things I can say about this movie. The acting was great, it had a lot more blood than the origional, and it was really suspenseful. If you haven't seen it than take my advice and BUY THIS MOVIE!
