Well, my Sonys are history. I never realized how smeary they were--no detail. These PX100s have good detail. But they also have a very strong overemphasis in the midrange that I do not like. Some folks may not be bothered by it; it will tend to emphasize vocals and guitars, albeit somewhat unnaturally. It also brings out background noise in the older recordings I like to listen to. I also think these phones have too much bass, but I expect that will be less of an issue for most people.So overall, I would say the PX100s have a very pop-oriented sound: surprising bass, strong vocals, good detail. My personal recommendation would be to get the Koss PortaPro headphones for a more natural, balanced sound and save a few bucks at the same time. (And if the price doesn't put you off, get the Sennheiser HD595 phones for sound that is so stunningly beautiful you won't ever want to stop listening with them.)
