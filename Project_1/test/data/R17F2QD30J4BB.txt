I know these are wireless and can be attached to your clothing and walk around, but I way too often find myself in the bedroom with the phone in the living room or vice versa. I knew the drill, as I already had a handset, however, this I had to pair myself. The instructions were a little bit confusing, but probably because I expected beeps I didn't get. I pressed the pairing button for 5 seconds, and then put the handset in the charger, and hoped that was it. I didn't see the messages I expected, but it may have been me waiting for beeps and not paying attention.Today I confirmed that they were paired, by sending my phone list from the phone to the handset. Let me review this handset with pros and cons:Pros====* Handset is light. It is a small handset, it doesn't weigh much. It feels a little bit plasticy, but I like the way it sits in my hand.* When you let a call go to the answering machine, you can hear the message on the phone. I like to screen calls from numbers I don't know, and this feature is nice when the CID isn't working (if for example the sender has a secret number). I can listen to the message, and if it someone I want to speak with, I can pick it up without having to go to the phone.* Listening to messages on answering machine is easy. The menus are easy enough to find your way around so you can tap into the answering machine on the phone and listen to messages.Cons====* Menus are a little bit confusing. While I can generally find all I need, it takes a little while before I find it. I sometimes quit by pressing the "Off" button and start again. I think they could have been done a bit more intuitively, but I have yet to not find what I am looking for.I haven't used this handset enough to establish how good the sound quality is, but I will get back with more info as soon as I have some.
