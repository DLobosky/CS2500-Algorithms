This 3 DVD set looks and sounds great. Season three is just excellent. While I love seasons one and two; season three is probably the pinnacle year for MASH. There are so many great episodes; practicably everyone of them are classics; No I take that back, every episode is a classic. It's wonderful to see these episodes the way they were meant to be seen, and not all cut up, like hey are on fx.I am in M.A.S.H Heaven.
