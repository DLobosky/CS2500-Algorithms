A new PS3 slim was our family Xmas gift and we purchased a number of new Blu-Ray movies to go with it. This was one of those movies and compared to the theatre experience this BD is outstanding! All of the visuals and actually better sound than the first time in the theatre. Great Picture + Outstanding Sound - Annoying Cell Phones and Chatting People = Great Entertainment !!!
