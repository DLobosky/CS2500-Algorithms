This is fast becoming my favorite all time yoga DVD because I got results from the very first session and feel fabulous every time I do it! I love Kundalini Yoga because it is more active than other styles I have tried and if I do nothing else in the day, I still feel I received, in addition to yoga benefits, some cardio ones. This DVD has 4 short (16-22 minute sets) which can be done all at once, or you can just do one. If I do another workout ,I will add at least the metabolism boosting set. What is fabulous about this workout is that I feel like I worked out hard, accomplished a lot, but am super energized, happy and feeling exceptionally clean and healthy when I am done!
