In his second collection of poetry, Short Sleeves: A Book for Friends 2007, many of Hal's poems in this volume vibrate with the possibility that radiates from change. Themes of forgiveness, unity, love and the cycles of life underscore the pervading theme that all is one, now is eternity, and we are co-creators with the Divine. Whether paying homage to penguins in the poem Flightless ("Dressed in suits of black and white, a touch of orange to show your class"), or swimming in an ocean in self love where "Now I am an island surrounded by myself", Hal reminds us of the grandeur of the Ground of Being from which all things arise.Sometimes playful but always wise, Hal's poems gives us kaleidoscope glasses allowing new perspectives and fresh ways of being in the world. His poem, I Am, reminds me a bit of Shel Silverstein:"I am brown I am greenI am tall I am a wallI am bark I am an arkI am roots I am leavesI am a fort I am a floorI am the opening for a doorI am you I am meConnected branches Of A Tree"Reminiscent of Rumi, Hal shows that he is in love with God and in love with reality. He writes in I Dance Everyday:"I dance everydayWith spiritSolo we waltzTo the music of loveAnd then we twistWith GodOn the dance floorOf Eternity."Filled with over 100 poems, Short Sleeves: A Book for Friends 2007 is a delightful romp with Spirit, reminding us not to take ourselves, or life, so seriously. Yet, Hal's poems also acknowledges difficult circumstances like war--a mirror reflecting our projected aggression, judgmentalism, and conformity. One of my favorite poems in this book is Shopping:"Shopping thru the store of lifeI found youMy gift to myselfThe ultimate present wrappedIn the warmth of the sunLit by the glow of the starsA gold ribbonTwirled around the moonOf my thoughtsWaiting patiently to be openedResting quietly on the shelfOf my mortalityMy mind peeks I feel your glanceAs the veil of forgetfulness dropsI jump into your joyKissing my giftOf remembering"Some other delightful poems in Short Sleeves: A Book for Friends 2007 include:*	A Brighter Version*	By the Pound*	God's My Name*	I Missed School One Day *	Mention Thinking*	Petal Power*	Seeds from the Sun*	Tennessee Ridge*	The Rock with Ears*	Water Me*	With the Snap of FingersI Missed School One Day is an especially poignant poem as Hal describes the soul of one of the Amish children that was gunned down in a schoolhouse. Dedicated to those precious Amish children, Hal writes:"I missed school one dayThat dayI taught the world to prayAbout forgivenessThe Jesus wayCleansing veins in hateful heartsDraining anger arteriesThat keep the world on a killing courseThat drives us from our loving SourceI had to die to show that IWill come againAgain and againTo show that love has no deathWhen we rememberThe forgiveness tool that which rulesThe school bells chime to love mankindIn all names we are the sameNot children who just blameAnd lay in the forgetfulState of judgmental minds"If you enjoy inspirational and metaphysical poetry, Short Sleeves: A Book for Friends 2007 is a heartfelt offering of witty observations, hard-won wisdom and poetic gymnastics. Hal coaxes us to view our world, each other, and ourselves with joy, exuberance and gratitude--remembering Who We Are through contrast and experience.
