A lot of people in the early '80s were selling the idea that the revolution of the sixties was over, was lost, and that all the sixties "radicals" had put on coats and ties and gone into white collar jobs.  This movie dramatized that idea, and the public ate it up.  In fact, the revolution, after some uncertainty in the '70s, had successfully established itself in certain departments of colleges and universities and was just beginning to roll, and strenuous efforts were being made to cover up this fact.  The present movie fit into that campaign (though whether Kasdan knew it or not we may never know.)  The revolution has since spilled out of the universities into broadcasting, publishing and film.  (If you want the full story, read The Rape of Alma Mater.)  There were certainly individuals, much publicized, who fit the "big chill" image, but they were a minority.  As to the movie, it really is boring and self-indulgent.  Buy it at your own risk.  I give it three stars because of the quality and performances of the cast.
