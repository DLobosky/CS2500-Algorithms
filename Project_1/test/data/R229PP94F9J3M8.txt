I ordered this mister for me and the white Prepara mister for my mom the same day.  This one is okay, but after using hers a few times, I have to say the Prepara is better.  This one gave a nice, fine spray similar to aerosol cans for the first couple uses, but the spray seemed to get less consistent with each use.  Eight or nine pumps usually gives a decent spray, enough to thoroughly coat all except my largest skillet.  Ten pumps builds a lot of pressure and sometimes produces a mist so fine that it wafts up or disperses out into the air instead of coating the pan.  There are always some larger droplets or "streaming" toward the end of the spray, but that will happen with all misters as the air pressure runs out--simple physics: less pressure, less force, less velocity, etc.  It's a small concern compared to the long-term health and environmental risks of thousands of aerosol spray cans. If a little oil drips down the side at the very end, a paper towel is an easy fix. This mister holds a fairly small amount of oil, but from what I've seen about the same as other misters, and it goes a long way because you use so much less oil.  The clear acrylic is nice so you don't overfill or run out. You also get to choose your own oil, and you can get a couple misters if you use different oils on a regular basis.  I think air misters work just fine for coating pans, spraying pasta and salads, and coating meats.  After using this one and the Prepara I bought for my mom, I will buy the Prepara next time because so far I've found it to give more even, consistent spray with little to no excess running down the side, and I like that it is clear glass instead of acrylic.  With all the misters, they'll work better and more consistently if you partially unscrew the top after each use to release any leftover air pressure.  You also have to use caution and not over-pump so you don't forcibly blow the top off the unit.  For both the models mentioned here, 6-7 even, uniform pumps is just right.
