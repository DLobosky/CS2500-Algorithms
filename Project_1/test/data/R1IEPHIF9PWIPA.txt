He's also an accomplished writer in other fields: his memoir of his own service in WW2, "Quartered Safe Out Here" is one of the best personal accounts to come out of that war, and he wrote the screenplay for "The Three Musketeers." In short, he's an accomplished guy.Flashman and the Tiger is only the second time, by my count, that the author has written something much out of order (the other time being Flashman and the Redskins, which contains a section from 1876). In this volume, Flashman recounts three adventures from his later life, one involving an attempt to assasinate the Emporer of Austria-Hungary, a second involving Flashy in a card-cheating scandal with the Prince of Wales entangled in it, and the third, the title piece, involving our hero deciding to kill a mortal enemy, and running into Sherlock Holmes in the process.The first of the stories is by far the longest, longer than 200 pages, and really almost a novel itself. It's a good story, even if it is a bit reminiscent of an earlier novel he wrote, and the characters are fun. The second story is a bit more mundane, though I'll confess the ending had me laughing for several minutes. The thirds story, which takes place partly in Africa during the Zulu War, is amusing, though I agree that this does somewhat preclude a full Zulu War novel. The Sherlock part is hilarious, and quite the best part of the book, to be honest. I'm a Sherlock buff of a kind (read all of the stories when I was in high school, twice) and I enjoyed it immensely.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this as an introductory book for the series, though you could have someone read one of the shorter stories and see if that's the sort of thing that interests them. I do know that some Americans find it hard to read a book written in the vernacular like this, and a short story would be a good way to figure things out. The first story's too long for this, but one of the other two might do.Given that, it's a worthwhile addition to the series, and fun.
