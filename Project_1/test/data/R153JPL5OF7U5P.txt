When I saw the price of these Westinghouse yard lights I went right past them. Too expensive I thought. After visiting my local home improvement stores and not finding any suitable yard lights I came back to the Amazon page with Westinghouse. Today I note this package is not available from Amazon. Hope they correct this as these are the best yard lights I have ever owned.As stated in the ad, the Westinghouse Kingsbridge II Hi-Intensity LED landscape lighting can add the perfect amount of light to any setting. It will beautifully accent any prized garden, or impeccably manicured landscape. These are LED lights which should last for years while at the same time using much less electricity.  The lights are bright and according to the packaging materials I should get a savings of over 44 Dollars per year on electricity plus the LED lights  can last for up to 10 years. These lights are made out of quality stainless steel construction with a stainless steel finish.  They are housed behind a glass lens in the path lights and a plastic lens in the spotlights. Comes with everything you need to get started, no tools are required, and it's easy to install with thier Plug N' Light system. Includes 6 Kingsbridge II landscape lights each with an 8-foot cord, 2 spotlights each with a 6-foot cord, and 10 watt transformer with a photo cell. OK the previous is what Westinghouse has to say. Now it's my turn. This was the easiest installation that I have ever made on a  set of lights. After installing the bulb, stick the light into the ground, take the 8 foot cords which has a very easy plug in at the end and plug it into your next light. And by the way, the 8 foot cord will be plenty long.Continue the process until you have all plugged in. Nothing could be easier.The standing lights are great as they give out a blue white light at night. Now for the spotlights. Wish they had left them out and given me two more standing lights. The amount of light the spotlights give out is not that great. I put both of mine on a corner next to a tall bush and shined them on that wall for background lighting. They worked OK but not outstanding. The standing lights are the best.I went back to the site to purchase as second set and found that they were not available on Amazon. Too bad!!!
