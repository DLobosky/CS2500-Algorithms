This is a belated review.  I actually bought this router 4.5 years ago. It was a Version 2.0. It was an awful first experience for a home wireless network.  Initial setup wasn't too difficult.  But, it would drop its wireless signal every few days and need to be completely reconfigured.  I spent numerous hours on the phone with Linksys Tech Support (India) over several weeks to get my network going again.  I finally gave up, but the return period had expired.After on-line research and word-of-mouth recommendations, I bought a Netgear WGR614.  It has just failed after 4.5 years and I have purchased the same Netgear model as a replacement.  It has never dropped its wireless signal.It is possible Linksys has improved this router over the years.  I know this is probably the most common router out there.  But, I would never consider one again.
