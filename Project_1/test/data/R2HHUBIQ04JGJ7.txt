Any New Orleans mansion worth its salt in water has to be haunted and Elancourt is haunted by the spirit of murdered ballerina, Neomi Laress.As a nice twist to the ever expanding paranormal and erotic genre, Neomi is the experienced one of the couple.  Conrad, as is established for vampires in Cole's series, literally mate with the one who is their Bride.  Given Conrad's background as a warrior, he is the virgin of the two and going mad from a life that is never ending.There are the usual quirks of Cole's Immortals series in this novel.  We meet up with previous characters like Mariketa and Bowe (of Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night (The Immortals After Dark, Book 3) as well as Conrad's brothers and wives.  There are scuffles between a few factions of the Lore which put the heroine in trouble.But really, the dynamic that holds this story together is what makes all good love stories work:  The chemistry of the hero and heroine which Neomi and Conrad have in spades.What I appreciated best about the story and probably what gives this book the edge over the other books in this series is that Conrad never truly loses all of his unhinged edge and at the same time, he never fully becomes an obnoxious alpha male either.  Conrad sits on a precarious ledge where he is good and bad and neither at the same time which makes him a truly intriguing hero.Neomi isn't quite as interesting to me but I think it is because Conrad was so interesting.  Yet, she has a unique vulnerability that no other Cole heroines have in that she starts out mortal.  How the issue of her mortality, her spirit form and how to resolve her mating with an immortal is resolved is one of the unique twists in the series.Again, I would not say that this is the best book of the lot as I firmly believe that A Hunger Like No Other (The Immortals After Dark Series, Book 1) occupies that spot and to be honest, I am really looking forward to Rydstrom's story in Kiss of a Demon King (The Immortals After Dark, Book 6) because Rydstrom has been one of my favorite side characters (in fact, I couldn't quite enjoy Cade's story in Dark Desires After Dusk (The Immortals After Dark, Book 5) because I was more interested in what was happening with Rydstrom than with Cade), but for now, Dark Needs at Night's Edge (The Immortals After Dark, Book 4) is my favorite, flaws and all.
