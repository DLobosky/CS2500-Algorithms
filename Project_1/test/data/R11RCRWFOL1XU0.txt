Suffice it to say that the heroine decides to pose as English nobility in order to secure guardianship of the child of a friend who's died, and to accomplish that, she gives her savings to a man she met first playing poker in a cheap tavern and later in the house of her wealthy employers being introduced as an English duke. There's a bit of a My Fair Lady flavor, though she's the one who instigates the transformation, and a nice twist that I initially suspected, then decided I was wrong.Entertaining, and different enough to make it worth the read.
