I'd give it 2 stars unless you have been following and enjoy the series.  This is primarily a people/politics book not a shoot em up.This fills in the gaps in the previous book.  Sets up for the next book, but unless you are a big fan of the series not necessary and not a good place to start the series as the background CD (with the earlier books) is missing.  It will be totally incomprehensible unless you go back to "Mission of Honor" and start there Still a good story for fans.
