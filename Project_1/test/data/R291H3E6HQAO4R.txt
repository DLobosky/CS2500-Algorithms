Since 1979, the fantastic party-band known as the B-52's has recorded and released 8 separate albums containing new material. To promote each new album, the band usually also recorded one or more music videos.  When the band released its 1998 album &quot;Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation&quot; (which was primarily a compilation of previous songs that included two new songs), the band simultaneously released a compilation of many of its videos entitled &quot;Time Capsule: Videos for a Future Generation&quot; on VHS.  The VHS contains twelve separate videos, of which five had not been previously released.  They include:1. &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; (5 stars).  A filming of one of the earliest live performances (March 3, 1979 in NYC) of one of the best known B-52's songs.  The song was part of the band's debut, self-titled 1979 album, &quot;The B-52's&quot;.2. &quot;Legal Tender&quot; (5 stars).  A music video of the first song from the 1983 album &quot;Whammy&quot;.3. &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot; (5 stars).  A music vides of one of the songs from the 1983 album &quot;Whammy&quot;.4. &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot; (5 stars).  The only music video filmed to promote the under appreciated 1986 album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, which was Ricky Wilson's last album with the band before his tragic loss.5. &quot;Channel Z&quot; (5+ stars). The first of five videos recorded from the B-52's most commercially successful 1989 album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.6. &quot;Love Shack&quot; (5+ stars).  The music video of the most well-known B-52's song that was also from the highly successful 1989 album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.  The actual &quot;Love Shack&quot; that was used in this video is in the possession of a diehard fan.7. &quot;Roam&quot; (5+ stars).  Probably the second most well-known B-52's song that was from their highly successful 1989 album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.8. &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot; (5+ stars).  Not as well known as the previous two songs, the previously unreleased music video for &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot; is the only B-52's music video that was filmed in black and white and features the band driving around in Athens, Georgia.  It's also from the 1989 album &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;.9. &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; (5 stars).  This only other live performance music video of the B-52's, which was also previously unreleased, was filmed during a live concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Shoreline, CA on August 17, 1990 during the &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; tour.10. &quot;Good Stuff&quot; (5+ stars).  This very fun and lively music video that was previously unreleased only has 3 B-52's members (Kate Pierson, Fred Schneider and Keith Strickland) because Cindy Wilson decided to take some time off from the band following the hectic &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; tour that lasted for two years.  The song is the title song from the 1992 album &quot;Good Stuff&quot;.11. &quot;Is That You Mo-Dean?&quot; (5 stars).  This very fun and cosmic video was also from the 1992 album &quot;Good Stuff&quot; and only features three B-52's members.  12. &quot;Debbie&quot; (5+ stars).  This wonderful video filmed in 1998 was filmed to promote the album &quot;Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation&quot; and is a tribute to the well known singer Debbie Harry, a.k.a. Blondie, who was an inspiration for the B-52's.  The video also features all four surviving members of the B-52's (Cindy Wilson returned to the band after her brief hiatus).Overall, my rating for the B-52's &quot;Time Capsule: Videos for a Future Generation 1979-1998&quot; VHS is a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  My only complaint about this collection is that doesn't include the video for &quot;Private Idaho&quot; (from the 1980 B-52's album &quot;Wild Planet&quot;) or the video for &quot;Revolution Earth&quot; (from the 1992 &quot;Good Stuff&quot; album).  I highly recommend this VHS to any B-52's fan and hope that the B-52's will one day release all of their videos on DVD.
