Tierney is quite the scholar. I have to say, however, that the reviewer who sees a few flaws in the book is correct, although I wouldnt say that the thesis is undermined.For those of us who are seeking to overcome the east-west division in Christianity (note that I did not say &quot;Church&quot;) and who find the role of the papacy as a crucial element to that union, I recommend: Brian Tierney's &quot;Origins of Papal Infallibility&quot; and &quot;Foundations of the Conciliar Theory&quot;; Heft's &quot;John xxii and Papal Teaching Authority&quot;; &quot;THeir Lord and OUrs&quot; ed by Santer; &quot;The Unity of the Churches of God&quot; ed by Sherwood; &quot;Byzantium and the Roman Primacy&quot; by Francis Dvornik; &quot;WHat Will Doctor Newman Do?&quot; by John Page; &quot;Towards Christian REunion&quot; by Bermejo; &quot;Ecumenism&quot; ed by Cunningham; &quot;Catholicity and the Church&quot; by John Meyendorff (everything he writes is insightful and scholarly); COngar's &quot;Diversity and Communion&quot; (read everything he writes!); &quot;Peter and Paul in teh CHurch of Rome&quot; by Farmer and Kereszty; and &quot;Rome and the Eastern Churches&quot; by that great scholar Aidan Nichols. There are, of course, so many others, so if you know of any that I need to read, email me via the &quot;about me&quot; page! Thanks!
