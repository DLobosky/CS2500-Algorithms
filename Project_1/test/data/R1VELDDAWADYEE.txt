Let me start by saying that I've been a 100% Apple person since back in the day when my first IIfx cost 12 Grand. I've used nothing but Macs every since.So it is difficult for me to criticize any Apple product but I have to warn potential purchasers of this ATV2 to be very careful.  You should read all the chat room comments and forums posted on various web sites such as MacObserver, Macrumors, Applesupport.com, etc, especially if you plan on using this unit to stream Netflix.  There are many frustrated people out there.I struggled with my unit for 3 months refusing to believe that there could actually be a lousy Apple product on the market.  BUT! I couldn't stream a movie without constant pausing, re-buffering, dropping audio, pixelation ... truly a study in frustration. I tried all the suggestions such as changing DNS settings, making sure my router was close to the atv, tried both wifi and hard wire connections, made sure I had at least 8 gigs of download speed ... all to no avail.I finally gave up and ordered a Roku XDS from Amazon. Worked perfectly right out of the box. Can't believe I wasted all that time fooling around with the ATV.  Maybe I just had a bad unit, but the Roku works so well I'm not going back.So buyer beware. If you do decide to go with the ATV2 and have streaming issues with Netflix, I suggest you box it up and send it back and go with the Roku.
