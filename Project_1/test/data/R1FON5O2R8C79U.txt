Anyone with issues digesting food, or plagued by gas, bloating, reflux, constipation, or diarrhea, should seriously consider buying this book.Most "issues" disappear within a day or two, and by day three, most feel "normal" again.It's a very healthy way to eat, stressing fresh, REAL foods, and as others have said, the recipes are pretty darn good too.  For those concerned with the "diet" aspect, should they need to gain weight instead of lose it, this book is still useful.  For one thing, you will be able to keep food down.  For another, you can always increase the fat content and still gain or maintain your weight.
