

I really enjoy Cajun music and have purchased the music of Buckwheat and Clifton Chenier.  This is the first purchase I have made of the recordings from Jimmy Newman and this CD is now part of my Cajun collection.I use most of my music on my MP3 player at the gym and this music keeps me going on the treadmill and Elliptical trainer.  Looking forward to buying more music from this artist.  I was very pleased with this CD and would recommend.
