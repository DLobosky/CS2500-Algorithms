I have just posted a review with the JBuds J3M with mic. They have a excellent customer service. They want to keep you happy and are very eagar to replace them ify you have problems. Have had nothing but problems with both products J3 and J3M. They are looking at a design change. Look great sound good fit good but not durbale. One of the ear phones stop working have had 3 J3M's and one J3. My son has a J3M also one of the ear phones stoped working 2 months ago. He said not very durable also. Please look a more in depth review on the J3M. Before you purchase.I have had nothing but problems with the JLab J3 earphones, I have had several replaced under warranty, they work fine for a few months and then one or the other earphons goes out. If you like dealing with warranty issues purchase a JLab J3 with mic, or one with out mic, I have both. The warranty is great but toooo much of a headache to deal with every several months. I WOULD NOT PURCHASE IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER!!
