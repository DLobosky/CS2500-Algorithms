The alliteration, the dance of the words is superb, yet the pictures are far from an afterthought.What we have is a group of ducklings, led by their fearless and protective mother, traveling across Boston. Trouble is, like children, they are tiny, and get intimidated by the bigness of Boston. The names of each duckling are alliterative and rhythmic. Reading this aloud will bring chuckles with the silly "Ouack and Lack and Kack..." all those "quack" rhymes.As a picture book with no social or political agenda, it is a delight to read aloud. Moms and Dads and big siblings will love going through the challenging duckling names quickly without getting tongue-tied.This treat for the eyes and ears, with beautifully drawn pictures and a carefully worded storyline, will bring your child into the Mallard family as they trek dangerously across town. A kind policeman helps them out, as do the people of the swan boat, easing the stress of the journey.Your library will have this book, but buy it. Get the hardcover. I still have the one my mom bought me in the late 60s or early 70s.Not only will the book be fun to read and reread, but it will teach a child language skills, particularly those relating to poetry. Even though it is not a poem, because it so well-written, it has those poetic qualities.When I visited Boston as an adult, I saw how familiar the town was only because I read "Make Way For Ducklings" as a child. The memories of this book are solid 30 years later, just as they will be for your son, daughter or younger relatives.I fully recommend "Make Way For Ducklings" by Robert McCloskeyAnthony Trendl http://anthonytrendl.com
