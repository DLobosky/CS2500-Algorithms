Mark Strauss' book gets the guernsey for readability and his sane approach to a topic that often unnecessarily gets people's dander up.It is worth reading Carson's &quot;The Inclusive Language Debate&quot; as well, but you will find his writing style less user-friendly. One highlight from Strauss' book is his discussion of the translation of ANTHROPOI and ADELPHOI. Earlier Bible translations almost always rendered these words as &quot;men&quot; and &quot;brothers.&quot; But it is sometimes obvious that the words are meant to include women as well. At other times it is not so easy to determine. For instance, were women allowed to participate in the selection in Acts 6:3? Did the Samaritan woman only tell all the men about Jesus, or did she speak to women too, in John 4:28?A newer, more up-to-date book, edited by Mark Strauss and others is now available. It addresses the TNIV translation and has helpful articles about the issue of whether a translation should be firstly trying to preserve the form of the original bible text or the meaning. It is called The Challenge of Bible Translation and has articles by Strauus, Carson, Silva and many other thinkers on this issue.
