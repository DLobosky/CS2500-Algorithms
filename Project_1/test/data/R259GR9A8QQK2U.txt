If you dread "Select All That Apply" questions, you need this book, because the NCLEX is filled with SATA. And I mean filled. (I just took it and passed.) Although it is painful to do so many SATA questions, the 206 questions in this book are great practice. When you take the NCLEX, you will be very glad you did them. I just put the CD in my drive and went through all the questions. There are also "hot spot", audio, etc. questions to practice. This book isn't the only book you should use to study, but it will definitely increase your comfort level when you take the NCLEX.
