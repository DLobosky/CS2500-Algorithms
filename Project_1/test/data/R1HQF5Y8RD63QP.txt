What's surprising is, despite this book having been released in 1993, there is only one review so far, mine being the second.  That does indeed say something, although I'm not sure what!What drew me to order and read this book intially is that the essays in the main are written by Jungian analysts of high repute.  I had read several previous books by Robert A. Johnson.  I liked them all very much.  And I, as a heterosexual woman who has never experienced physical desire for another woman, nor falling in love with someone of the same sex, wanted to have a deeper understanding of those who do encounter and experience these things.Most, not all, of the writers are themselves homosexual.  And I must say they are brutally honest with the revelations of their experiences.  They are to be highly commended for this.  And it speaks of their strong confidence that they are able to lay their personal lives out on the line with such honesty and dignity.Robert A. Johnson's essay, one of my favorites, is not about homosexuality per se.  It is about a way of male to male relating that is absent from the Western world which he discovered and experienced while residing in India.  There is a moving moment in which he described a day when he was riding his bicycle "when a young fellow came along paralleling me (him)...The young fellow remained parallel to me, so I moved over a little farther--but he was still there.  Presently he reached out, took my hand and we proceeded for a block, riding together hand in hand.  He turned off at the next street and I never saw him again.".Most of the lesbian writers seem to have become so after years of marriage and child rearing.  And surprisingly they frequently use the same expressions for the reasons for their choice:  return to the mother, the way it seems so natural, a feeling of having come home, not having to live up to a role expected by the patriarchy (being able to be relaxed and themselves) and having truly intimate relationships they did not find possible with men.A few of the gay writers express their concern and reasonings as to why gay men often do not treat each other well.  I do take, if not umbrage, at least an opposing view, to one writer who says that, in cases of the split anima (one split being an immature puella, the other a dominating mother figure who is not maternal), these projections can fall upon actresses who are masculine and un-maternal (he names Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich among these) and who are feminine and maternal (e.g., Marilyn Monroe).  Now these definitions are truly stereotypical.  Garland in her illness and fragility was anything but masculine, and her three children I am certain would not consider their mother to have been un-maternal.  I have read interviews with Liza Minnelli which describe her mother has having been "great fun."  Dietrich (herself bisexual) I had the privilege of meeting once.  I certainly did not feel that I was meeting anyone who resembled a man.  Her daughter has written a book about her relationship with Ms. Dietrich which I have not read.  So I don't know what her viewpoint is about this matter.  As for Marilyn Monroe, because she was kittenish and spoke with a little girl's voice (and I do not mean to disparage her; in fact, I admire her greatly in that she was able to accomplish so much of value while at the same time being psychologically overwhelmed with inner disturbances), and was too much of a lost child herself to ever be considered maternal, I particulary disagree with the writer's opinion.This book really opens up a floodgate of knowledge for all who have an interest.  I would like to think it has more readers than Amazon reviewers.  It certainly enlightened me and enlarged my scope of knowledge.  And yet I have a singular feeling that this is just the tip of the iceberg.
