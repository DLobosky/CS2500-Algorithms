She has a run in with one of the kids of the local mob; then gets embroiled with a pro bono hit that gets her further embroiled against the mob.  Nicely done plot and characters with a good motivation for the pro bono work.  Obviously Gin hasn't got the research and setup stage down pat and is too much a opportunist.  But the action is good and the characters are great.  There is some humor as well.Nicely done ; an excellent read
