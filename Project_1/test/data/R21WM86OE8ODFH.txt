Great series presented in orginal balck and white format. I did have the fist season from Disney movie club which was colorized and contained on five discs. So six discs in this set means extras that I'm enjoying. Found the first season to be as entertaining as I remembered as a boy 50 plus years ago. Masked heroes have always been a favorite and none better than Zorro.updated 5/10 I have finished watching the final episode of the second season. The story arcs are shorter, three or four episodes in the second season, but none the less entertaining. I must say have a sense of loss - trying to understand why there were only two seasons of this excellent show. I know there was some sort of squabble between Walt Disney and ABC as Walt was trying to move to NBC and color, but this was really an exceptional series and the viewer got the short end of it with the premature cancellation. A wit and a warmth to the characters, great production values, and all the swash and buckle that you could want with the sword fighting and daring do. Anyway, thanks to WD Treasury for bringing back some truly fun and exciting entertainment. I enjoyed it as a lad and just as much as a semi senior citizen. Highly recommended!!!
