Guns 'N' Roses burst onto the music scene like a hurricane with the release of Appetite For Destruction.  The band members were in constant turmoil with one another and it's this combustible atmosphere that help  create some of the most aggressive, angry, unapolegetic music ever made.   With it's driving guitar riff and pounding drums, &quot;Welcome To The  Jungle&quot; opens the album and sets the overall tone.   &quot;Nightrain&quot; &amp; &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; deal with the band's  alcohol and drug addictions.  &quot;Out Ta Get Me&quot; deals with their  paranoia and &quot;My Michelle&quot;, &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; &amp;  &quot;You're Crazy&quot; sum up their feelings toward women.  &quot;Sweet  Child O' Mine&quot; and &quot;Paradise City&quot; are my two favorites on  the album and they show glipses of the band's softer side.  The former is  suprisingly a beautiful ode to the love of a woman and the latter is a  about going to a utopian like community.  In the 13 years since it's debut,  there hasn't been an album released that has rocked harder than this one.
