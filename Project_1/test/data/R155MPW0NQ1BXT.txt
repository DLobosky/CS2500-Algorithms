I just like to support the industry and want to have a nice time at home too, sometimes even cheaper than alcohol or pubs ;-)MW3 is not the 1st one I own of the series. And after a few days of playing with it I must say is more of the same. Same guns, same concept, same experience, even same engine. I don't see major improvements in terms of the actual game or the overall gaming experience.If you are new to FPS or this game will be your welcome ticket to the Activision's franchise, you won't be disappointed. It's a great game. Lot of action, small maps, it will keep you entertained for a while. But seeing this in a more objective way or I should say, in a retrospective way, this game is more of the same successful recipe. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that, but why buy this one again if you have Black Ops or MW2 already? Unless budget is not an issue  buy it, otherwise my advice is skip this one or maybe wait a few months or a year, buy it used (that's something you gain when you're older, wait a year or so for a game is not a problem for us, hahahaha)In terms of the actual experience itself, the maps are small. Nice graphics and the scenarios are more vivid than in previous games of the same series. The online experience is basically the same, although I've experienced some network problems or server issues that makes me believe there are some glitches or too many active users. This is sporadic of course, but wanted to mention it anyway. The co-op and solo options are also nice and for the player who is more like "slow pace" gamer, like me, is a less frustrating experience; you play more that way, you die less frequently.If you're on the fence about getting this one, think about this: do you like small maps, fast pace gaming experience? Go for it, get MW3 today! Otherwise, I fully recommend you Battlefield 3. BF3 requires more skills, you play more and the maps are huge. The engine is a new one and you can be playing on any specific place in the map and the house or building just collapsed after a rocket's hit. That's how realistic that game is.
