I wanted to know when this was coming out seeing I missed it in theaters thought I'd pass along what info I found via blu ray's website and movieweb.Blu raySound and picture specsVideo will be presented in 2.35:1 1080p accompanied by a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Spanish soundtrackDvd Special featuresSpecial Features- When Laura Grew Up: Constucting The Orphanage featurette- Horror In The Unknown: Makeup Effects featurette- Tomas' Secret Room featurette- Still gallerypresented in Spanish with English subtitles (similar to how 'Pan's Labyrinth', a film directed by Del Toro, was released).One reviewer compared this to The Changeling which is one of the greatest ghost stories in my opinion as well.Guillermo Del Toro who produced this film mentions his top 5 ghost story films on ew's website and listed The Changeling, perhaps it did have an influence.
