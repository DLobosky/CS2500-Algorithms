The Epson C60 prints great. No matter what paper you use the quality is the same, excellent. It is very fast. And I also like the price....    Here's the problem...the Epson C60 is a real ink guzzler. The ink runs out way too fast. The printer has an ink monitor and when you put in a cartridge (black or color) the monitor says it's full. However, when you print a one page document, the monitors ink level is at 3/4 full, what's that?     I would have gave his printer 4 or 5 stars but the ink situation is bothering me. The printer is reasonably priced but with the amount of ink cartridges you will have to buy, the printer will end up causing you alot in the long run.
