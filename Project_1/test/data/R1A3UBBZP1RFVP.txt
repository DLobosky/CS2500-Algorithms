I already have the Lunch Box Diet and because I liked it so much I went ahead and bought the Lunch Box Diet Vegetarian, and once again I must say that this guide it's incredible, there are so many ideas for your lunch that you will never have the same lunch for a long time, all of the ideas are very easy to prepare and very healthy, and also a great way to keep your calories intake low and lose weight.
