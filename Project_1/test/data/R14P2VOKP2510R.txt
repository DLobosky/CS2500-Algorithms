The miniseries is the quality of a good movie and the episodes which follow are top notch. BG is a well-crafted, adult, serious Scifi series that eschews the hokey and the exotic for down-to-earth tales of human relationships in outer space. (Is that a mixed metaphor or what?)      The miniseries tells us of the attack by the man-made cylons on the 12 inhabited worlds of the universe, the utter defeat of man, and the flight of the last remaining 50,000 humans in a rag-tag fleet led by an ancient warship, the Battleship Galactica. Olmos is the captain of the BG; McDonnell is the insignificant politician who becomes the President -- thus the conflict between military and civilian becomes one of the continuing themes. In season one, the Battlestar Galactica searches for planet earth, the legendary thirteenth home of the human race while attempting to avoid the cylons. A premium in this series is placed on acting talent and interpersonal relationships. Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell are superb, seasoned actors and they carry off the lead roles perfectly. The younger actors are equally good; there's not a false note anywhere. "Number Six" (Tricia Helfer) adds a generous helping of sex appeal and glamour that is lacking in many Scifi movies. Every character is well-defined.  The sets are good; the action scenes are realistic; the tension is high; and the cliff-hanger endings are often spectacular.   Perhaps my enthusiasm is too much -- but BG is my all-time favorite Scifi series. It's a survival story I find credible, touching, and sad.You don't have to be a scifi or action flick fan to like BG -- although there's plenty of both. Now, it's on to see season two of the series. I can hardly wait. Smallchief
