Unfortunately it is straight down the dustpipe from there. I remember when I bought the original vinyl back in college.  After the first listen, I put the lp back in the sleeve and it's been gathering dust there ever since.  Virtually unlistenable when compared to any of the groups previous efforts.  Why 2 stars instead of one?  &quot;Ace Frehley lead guitar!&quot;.   The final nail in the coffin of the original KISS.
