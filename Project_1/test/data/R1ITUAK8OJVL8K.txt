But the book is Lincoln Barnett's The Universe and Dr. Einstein. The original review continues below:I've read just about every book on Einstein's theories meant for the  general reader (as well as not-so-general reader) and this is the clearest,  most concise, and best-written book ever done on the subject.I read this  book almost 30 years ago and it's good to see from the other reviews here  that people still know about this terrific book. It's a little masterpiece  of science reportage done during a time (1950) when there were very few  talented writers doing this sort of thing (unlike today), and in which  there wasn't much demand for science writing in general. Lincoln Barnett  was a gifted journalist and he produced a little classic in this book.
