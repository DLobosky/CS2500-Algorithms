Prince returns with a decent follow-up to 2004's Musicology, 3121.  On the new album, Prince harkens back to the 80's synthesized sound of pops, crackles and squawks.  This is best showcased on the song "Lolita" which employs a stripped down sound built around a heavy electronic sound.  "Black Sweat" has a start and stop rhythm with a crackling synthesizer.  The ballads are the weak part of the album with only the sultry "Satisfied" really hitting the mark.  The best two tracks on the album are "Fury" and the album closer "Get On The Boat".  The former is a blistering rocker that recalls his 80's glory days and the latter is a full-out funk jam that features the great Maceo Parker and burns the cd the down at the close.  3121 has its moments and it is a tight collection of only twelve tracks (mercifully he has seemed to stop over bloating his albums with filler) that helps cement Prince's comeback.
