If your family is about to be killed, then you call the cops even if it means that the press will find out about your past, ok?  And even if you "can't prove it" - duh!  I spent from page 50 onwards saying "b--- s---" over and over to myself in a sing-songy voice.  There aught to be a law against books like this.  But I can't call the cops...
