The brainchild of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, I Love Lucy revolutionized the television industry with its extensive use of a live audience and the employment of multiple camera angles. The result of true comic genius, the show's ability to entertain is just as relevant today as it was fifty years ago...
 
 Real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the prominent roles of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a married couple living in a New York apartment complex. Ricky is a Cuban-born band leader who wows night clubs with his act, while Lucy is a homemaker. Lucy and Ricky's best friends are landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz who often become intertwined in Lucy's get-rich-quick schemes, screwball ideas, and comic shenanigans. Former masters of the stage, the cast comes across as a likeable bunch, with Lucille Ball stealing the show with her goofy antics and brilliant facial contortions. If ever there were a television classic, then I Love Lucy is it...
 
 The I Love Lucy (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere "Lucy Cries Wolf" in which Lucy becomes uncertain of Ricky's dedication to her welfare and safety. Despite Ricky's assurances that he will rush home in the middle of his act if she were in danger, Lucy decides to put Ricky's promise to the test... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include "The Business Manager" in which Ricky hires a business manager to take control of the Ricardo household budget, and "Getting Ready" in which the Ricardo's and the Mertz's decide to drive to Hollywood in a 25-year-old used Cadillac purchased by Fred...
