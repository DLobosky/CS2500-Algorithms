Instead, it simply offers scenarios to give some variety in the where and when.  It suggests different locations where you can surprise your lover with a BJ.  Next time he wakes up with a woodie, give him the BJ he's dying for.  Or join him in the shower and give him one.  This is not technique, it is scenario.  You aren't really learning how to give unforgettable oral, although I suppose the argument could be made that any time a woman actually gives a guy a BJ in all of the 24/7 situations he would want them is pretty much a miracle that he won't forget any time soon.  And yes, ladies, guys want one 24/7.If that's all you're looking for, this book contains lots of alternative ways to enjoy offering him oral sex.  But you'll learn absolutely nothing new as far as technique goes.If you are truly looking for technique, [...] offers substantial new insight that can help in your oral sex techniques.  That book focuses on the use of your hands and tongue and discusses specific areas that benefit from stimulation, to allow you to give him oral sex that he'll truly never forget.  It details methods that most women do not intuitively know, including the actual techniques that turn guys on.I'm putting a similar review on the partner book for this (we got them both, together with "Red Hot Touch"), because the same criticisms apply.  Sorry Sonia, but both are books are certainly forgetful.
