There are two pages of practice for this; one is rewriting the sentence, and one is editing a paragraph that has no capital letters or periods, with two questions at the bottom of the page which kids can answer with their own written statements.  Both pages are about flying kites, and there is a color picture of a kite.While these exercises are fine and will give kids practice in punctuating statements, they are not interesting at all.  In the past, Spectrum workbooks have had witty puns or silly poems or adventure stories that kids could punctuate or find nouns or whatever the assignment might be.  What happened to the clever writer that used to make these workbooks?  Learning language should not just be about mechanics, but also about appreciating the various uses of language: puns, poetry, narrative...  These new workbooks communicate to kids that language is pretty much just boring preparation for standardized tests.
