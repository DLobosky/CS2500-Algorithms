Let's begin...Match #1 Eddie Guererro & Rey Mysterio vs. The Bashams for the WWE Tag Team Championships: CRAP! Eddie and rey were suppose to lose resulting in a heel turn for Eddie, leading to him and Rey at WM21. It's 20 days until WM21 and I don't know how they plan on building this match up at all. Anyways Eddie and Rey beat the horrible Bashams and win the tag titles. Decent opener. 7/10I'm not gonna get into the Diva segments at all because they were a waste of time. They could have gotten rid of these and atleast had one more match in there, like Cena working two matches and the other involving the US title.Match #2 Booker T vs. Heidenreich: UGGH, poor Booker T...one of my favorite wrestlers ever, and he is getting such a raw deal here, it's disgusting. Book wons by DQ after a chairshot to the throat. I'm so glad Book got his revenge twice on Smackdown! and maybe they'll give him a good feud now, because even Book couldn't make Heidenreich look good...5/10Match #3 6 Man Guantlet for the Cruiserweight Title: A majority of the fans suck because they never give the cruiserweight s the respect they deserve. their matches are ruined by Divas and they get little to no recognition. paul London started this match and went the whole way only to get cheated by Chavo. Funaki walked in the champ and was the first to be eliminated, WOW! Chavo becomes new champ and we get to see Chavo vs. Paul London at WM21. I see this opening the show and it will be awesome! 10/10 even though this match was short!Match #4 Taker v.s Luther Reigns: Taker made reigns look good in a match that I was sure would stink the joint up, but was better than I expected. Taker wins, obviously. 6/10Match #5 Kurt Angle vs. John Cena for the #1 Contenders Slot a WM21: Match of the night by far! This was a war. I thought Kurt broke Cena's neck when he german suplexed him into the turnbuckle, CRAZY!!! I thought HBK would interfere here, but I'm glad he didn't cuz it would have made Cena look weak. Cena wins clean with the FU and is going to WM21!!! 10/10!Match #6 Big Show vs. JBL (c) in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match for the WWE Title: Kind of slow at times, but a great match! With the "lack" of outside interference (yes there was still some), it made the match good, and JBL won CLEAN! Big Show chokeslams JBL through the ring, Big Show rips the chain off the door and as he is about to win JBL's music starts to play...JBL crawled out through the bottom of the ring!!! AWESOME! The Cabinet comes down to attack Show, but then Batista comes in and cleans house of the Cabinet! Then Cena spinebusts JBL through some stage and he and Batista have one of the longest stare downs ever to end the show. 9/10!Besides the diva crap, this was a decent PPV. It was better then No Way Out 2004. The only other bad thing about this was the the barbed wire never came into play during the whole match. At least find a reason to watch this, but don't buy it if you can avoid it.
