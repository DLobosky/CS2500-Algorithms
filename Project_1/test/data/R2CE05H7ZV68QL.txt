For over 70 years, Americans (both adults and children) have enjoyed playing Monopoly.  If your company has an annual Christmas toy drive for children who might not otherwise receive a present, this would be a great gift to add to the pile.  In addition to being fun, this game would help disadvantaged children develop their math skills, learn the principle of cost-benefit analysis by discerning which trades are and are not worth making, develop the negotiating skills necessary to make beneficial trades (and avoid being talked into making bad trades), and hone their strategic thinking abilities.
