Band on the Run topped the charts at #1, it was his third album to do so. Three singles were released from this album, "Band on the Run" which went to #1, his third single to do that, "Helen Wheels" peaked at #10 & "Jet" which peaked at #7. In just three short years the former Beatle was proving himself to be the most successful of the Fab Four.Band on the Run is one of Sir Paul's most adventurous albums. The story behind the recording of the album is no less entertaining. The majority of this album was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria. When Paul had heard that EMI (Capitol Records) was building a studio there he wanted to put it to use. Upon announcing this to his bandmates his drummer & lead player decided they didn't want to go. McCartney, always a difficult person to deal with, decided to go ahead & record the album with only himself, wife Linda & Denny Laine. When they arrived in Lagos Paul found the studio not completed (they would be the first musicians to record there), many Nigerians were upset thinking they were there to 'steal' their music, transportation & housing were atrocious & the government itself in a state of flux. I mention all these things to show how difficult it was to record this album &, yet, it is, almost without any doubt, the best album he recorded. He did this under all these pressures; actually playing all the instruments except for Linda on synthesizers & Laine on rhythm guitar.Band on the Run doesn't have a weak song on it, I wouldn't consider a single song here to be filler. And as adventurous as the song "Band on the Run" is & acknowledging that it was a #1 single, it's actually the weakest song here. The album opens with the title track followed by "Jet" one of his solid rockers. Then comes "Bluebird", one of his absolute best album tracks, it could have been a single. It's chorus is dynamic, has great harmonies & an incredible sax solo in it. "Mrs. Vanderbilt" follows, though it might be the next weakest song from the album it is, nonetheless, an entertaining piece. "Let Me Roll It" is also one of the best album tracks he ever recorded, it's another song that could have been released as a single. Played in 6/8 gives it a very special feel, Paul plays a very distorted lead guitar. With the reverb drenched vocal & distorted guitar, that, in some ways, reminiscent of Lennon's "Cold Turkey", one can see why some consider this song as a McCartney tribute to a former Beatle. "Mamunia" is a beautiful ballad that has some impressive lyrics, something that McCartney has received much criticism about. "No Word" co-written with Laine, is next that's another solid piece of creativity. Then there's "Helen Wheels", a song about his sand buggy, a play on words, & one of the best leads recorded by him. One of the amazing things about this song is that it hasn't a single chord change! It's a solid piece of recording studio wizardry; McCartney is acknowledged by many in the business at being sheer genius at this. Then there's "Picasso's Last Words", a song suggested by Dustin Hoffman, that has several different movements & speed changes. It's another piece of studio wizardry. The album closes with "Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five", another one of Paul's best album tracks. He plays piano to great effect & is an incredibly rocking song. Unfortunately, this song has the sort of lyrics that McCartney is constantly criticized over; they don't make any sense. This is another one of those cases by him where he's more concerned about the lyric scansion than the lyrical sense; they sound good & they flow extremely well. Because it's such an incredible song I'm willing to forgive him for what could be considered to be a weak set of lyrics.
