This device is fast and has worked fine without any issues until yesterday after a month of use. I normally leave this 16GB USB drive plugged in to my desktop PC whether the PC is on or off. Yesterday I installed an external Western Digital 1.5T harddrive and immediately after I turned on my PC, an error message "disk I/O error, replace drive and hit any key to continue" appeared. I thought my new hard drive was bad. Without doing anything I hit the Ener key and my PC started up without problem and all the drives worked fine without issue. To further test the cause of the issue, I unplugged all the external drives (three including this 16GB USB drive) one at a time and found out when this USB drive is not plugged in, the error message also disappeared at the start-up. Interestingly, if I plugged this USB drive when the PC is already on, then no error message would appear. I also moved this USB drive to a different USB port, the same error message would appear at the PC start-up. I also tested using another USB drive and encountered no error message at all. It is convincing the error message is triggered by this 16GB USB drive. In reality no real problems are caused. I can access data in this drive as long as I ignore the error message by hitting any key to continue the start-up. Has anyone seen this problem?
