However, what a surprise to see my regular DVD's made from the Panasonic 3-D camcorder in 3-D without glasses on this Cody portable 3-D player. I made a regular DVD by utilizing the RCA cable supplied with the Panasonic 3-D camcorder and by connecting it directly to my DVD recorder I can make a standard DVD in 3-D. There are 2 images side by side and when playing the DVD in the Cody player there is a setting for side by side 3-D format.I did notice slight pausing every few seconds while playing the DVD on the Cody player so more testing of this unit will have to be done.UPDATE: There is no pausing. It was just a defective DVD.You have to sit directly in front of the Cody 7 inch screen to see 3-D properly.Don't expect HD quality when viewing 3-D on the Cody player.It's just a convenient way to watch your Panasonic 3-D video when you're away from home.The Cody player has no 3-D adjustments so some periodic ghosting is noticed but it works!It's the only way you can enjoy your 3-D videos on the go in 3-D and when you get home you can watch your AVCHD 3-D DVD's on your 3-D TV.I am not a big fan of CODY or V-ZON because these cheaply made products usually bite the dust after the warranty expires but I'll take a chance on keeping this player because it's the only way I can watch 3-D without glasses of videos made on my Panasonic 3-D camcorder.UPDATE OCTOBER 2011I have discovered a way to transfer 3-D video from my HD-Direct DVR to standard DVD's and this allows me to watch all the 3-D programs on this Cody 3-D Player.I can copy ESPN-3D, Panasonic 3-D and Sony-Discovery-Imax 3-D channels on to a standard DVD by utilizing a cheap HDMI splitter and a $50.00 adapter which changes HDMI to Component RCA (Yellow-Red-White)and S-VHS.I realize I lose the High Definition video quality but at least I can save and watch all 3-D programs from Direct TV without using the DVR.I can also watch these DVD's on my 3-D TV by utilizing the latest model Panasonic Bluray 3-D player because the player has a way to choose Side By Side 3-D.The key to utilizing the HDMI "Y" adapter is to first connect only the 3-D TV to the DVR, Then once 3-D is established I connect the RCA powered adapter HDMI to the "Y" adapter.Now with both HDMI cables connected you will see a Side By Side image on the monitor/TV connected to the DVD recorder.Once this is established you can disconnect the 3-D TV because you have sucessfully tricked the DVR to think it has a 3-D TV connection.Now, you can proceed making a DVD copy of the 3-D program.This proceedure will have to be done everytime to record a 3-D program otherwise you will receive a message that Reads: You must have a 3-D TV connected in order to watch this program.Although the video quality is not really acceptable on a larger LCD screen TV it works great on this Cody 3-D player.Note: You must select Side By Side on the Cody 3-D player in order to watch 3-D properly.I also experimented with a similar proceedure utilizing my Toshibe 3-D laptop with the same connections with the HDMI output and sucessfully made a standard 3-D DVD from both of my Sony 3-D camcorders.You can do this with any 3-D laptop providing it has the Stereoscopic viewer.All you need to do is choose Side By Side from the options provided by the Stereoscopic player.Everything appears on the screen with 2 side by side images but when played on this Cody 3-D player or on a Bluray 3-D player you will see 3-D, not 2-D.Again, be aware that you are viewing the 3-D in standard 480 video quality.I am waiting for Cody to come out with a similar 3-D player with AVCHD and/or Bluray 3-D capability.Until then I will be have to be satisified with this proceedure.
