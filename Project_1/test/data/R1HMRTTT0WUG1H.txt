I Only Wanted You is a pleasing and melodic album from Marie Osmond.  Her singing is very attractive and smooth.  This disc is in a country pop musical direction.  A total of ten tracks is included--I find every one of them to be listenable and worthwhile.  The musicianship is tight, the songwriting is fulfilling, and the production is taut and polished.  Three of the ten songs are pretty ballads--&quot;Cry Just a Little,&quot; &quot;I Know the Feeling,&quot; and &quot;More Than Dancing.&quot;  Also, one of the tracks (&quot;You're Still New to Me&quot;) features a duet between Osmond and Paul Davis.  The opening song, the ballad &quot;Cry Just a Little,&quot; is my favorite tune of the album--it's an engaging one that displays impressive vocals from Osmond and a charming chorus.  &quot;Everybody's Crazy 'Bout My Baby&quot; is an upbeat cut with a cool dose of saxophone playing, too.  I enjoy the choruses throughout this disc.  The CD insert doesn't include the song lyrics.  The album is just over 33 minutes in length, also.  I Only Wanted You is good and tuneful.
