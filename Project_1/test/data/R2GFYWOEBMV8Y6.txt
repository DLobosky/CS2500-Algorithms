In a film, a repeated theme gives the listener a point of familiarity. Sometimes composers have themes for certain characters or events [as in John Williams' Star Wars music].The first Lord of the Rings movie has 2 or 3 of these themes, which are repeated a lot on the CD. The music is terrific and the performances are wonderful, but you may get sick of hearing these themes after the 4th or 5th time!I really appreciated Enya's input, though I wasn't expecting to. It fits with Howard Shore's score very well.I bought the standard edition, and reading reviews of the limited version do not make me regret it.One point which I have not seen mentioned in the other reviews is that Shore wrote the whole score, arrangement and orchestration included. Many film composers today would not even be capable of doing this, and those who could might well assign some of these tasks to the hacks. You will most probably enjoy the music, particularly if you found it moving during the film.However, be warned that many of the tracks contain the same themes, though dressed in different garb.
