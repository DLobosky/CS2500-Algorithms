We have, however, invested in some books that didn't prove worthwhile and so before shelling out the money for Giada's books, I decided I would check them out from the library, make some recipes, and go from there.  I wanted to know if the recipes were as good as she makes them look on the show and if, upon tasting it, my husband and I would have expressions on our faces that mirror the food ecstasy Giada seems to experience.  The answer to that question: Oh, yes!  Today I've ordered all three of her books because I simply can't imagine living without them and not being able to make her delicious, heavenly recipes whenever I want.  Here are my thoughts on a few of the recipes:Rigatoni with Sausage, Peppers, and Onions - I come from an Italian family and grew up with Italian sausage on the grill, peppers and onions served alongside.  I've never had it with pasta before but Giada's recipe is divine.  I used chicken Italian sausage rather than the turkey and this dish was so tasty that I could hardly wait to eat the leftovers the next day.Roman-Style Fettuccine with Chicken - This was another hit that even my rather picky daughter liked.  The sweetness of the peppers blends well with the mustardy tang of the capers.  The chicken was juicy and delicious and the sauce perfectly seasoned.Turkey and Artichoke Stuffed Shells - My four-year-old daughter loved this one so much that as she was eating it, she was asking when we could have it again.  I found the yield to be much higher than indicated in the recipe but this was a bonus as I was able to make an extra tray of the shells, freeze them, and then pop them into the oven one night for a quick dinner.  The dish is savory and delicious and tastes very rich--even when using all white meat ground turkey.Linguine and Lobster Fra Diavolo - My husband raved about this one and positively devoured it.  I'm not as big of a seafood fan as he is but I liked it as well.  It has a very nice bite to it and is surprisingly spicy for a dish with just a bit of red pepper.  The cognac really brought out the bite of the pepper.Basic Marinara - This is a tasty basic sauce that is easy to make and just takes a bit of time for the simmering.  We made a double batch and frozen it and it was very good when thawed and used to make a quick baked penne with some mozzarella.
