If this were a mystical novel, we would say that outer events reflect inner life, but it isn't the least bit mystical, but hard nosed suspense fiction, and all the more remarkable for that.Sara Linton may still love police chief Jeffrey Tolliver, her ex-husband, but she has never quite healed from the discovery that he has cheated on her.  Even thought they are coming back together, when Jeffrey's ex-girlfriend tells him he needs to have tests for hepatitis, Sara has a sudden fit of jealousy.  In the middle of their argument they trip over a murder site.  They discover the body of a pregnant girl who was entombed alive for several days, and then killed by a lethal dose of cyanide poured down her through.  Murder doesn't get any more gruesome than that, and suddenly differences are forgotten as they begin the hunt for a cold blooded murderer.Scant clues eventually lead them to a religious farm community in Grant County.  This isn't so much a cult as a family business that gets its workers from outreach efforts in nearby cities.  Their employees are temporary and drawn from some of the worst parts of society so suspects are many - was the girl murdered by an employee or kin, to avoid an unpleasant revelation or to silence other secrets?  There are few clues, and Sara finds that her own family has ties with the Wards, and wherever she looks there are secrets.In a parallel them, Detective Lena Adams terminates an unwelcome pregnancy from Ethan, her sadistic boyfriend.  Her path crosses that of another woman at the abortion clinic.  Lena, overcome by her own feelings of worthlessness and guilt tries to help young Terri Stanley another nightmarish series of events that will eventually lay bare the whole rotten evil core of betrayal and murder.  This is a shocking story, not just because of horror that is happening, but because we see deeper into many of the characters we have taken for granted, and the truth is not always comforting.This is a classic Karin Slaughter story.  A disturbing study of a sleepy rural South that is neither all that sleepy nor all that safe.  The setting provides a sharp contrast to to events that would seem less uncomfortable in an urban setting, and this hammers home the reality that people are vulnerable wherever they live.
