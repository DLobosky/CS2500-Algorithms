That means I need headphones for game play. And I've tried/tested pretty much all of them, including the earlier versions of Turtle Beach (wired and wireless, like the X2) as well as many other brands, like the Tritton True 5.1 Digital Audio Headset with AX360 Audio Xtreme 360.Until the Turtle Beach Ear Force X3 Wireless Headphones (which I got for Christmas), my two favorite were:* the Turtle Beach EarForce X2 (wireless)* The Trittons (wired)Both of the above had pros and cons. The pros of the X2s was that they were wireless and had decent Xbox Live Chat capabilities. The pros of the Trittons was the fantastic sound quality. There are 4 dials for sound alone! If you don't play games that require Xbox Live, these are fabulous headphone. They use an optical sound cable. Fab sound quality.Cons of both the X2 and the Trittons: depending on the game, is that it can be hard to clearly hear your teammates during the heat of battle -- even in the lobby if there is default game music playing (in Call of Duty 4, there is no user option to turn this music off). You also can't hear yourself talk -- both of your ears are covered, naturally, so when you talk, you tend to get LOUD because you can't hear yourself. Your own voice is muffled.Turtle Beach Ear Force X3 Wireless Headphones for Xbox 360 solved this problem. Now you can "hear" yourself talk. Much like when you are on the phone, you can hear a little bit of your voice through the earpiece part of the phone.The wireless base station is also MUCH smaller than the X2's base station. Which was huge mainly because it was designed to needlessly hold the headphones when not in use.Pros of the X3s:* Set up takes about 3 minutes. Plug and play.* The earphones are comfy -- even on my big, adult head* Wireless* Can "hear" yourself talk through the headphones* "Bass boost" option mode (a switch near the volume)* TWO volume dials: one for overall gameplay, another for Xbox Live chat. For example, I love Call of Duty 4, but you are unable to turn off the lobby's default music in between games. With the other headphones, I had trouble hearing folks. The X3s enable you to dial down the music altogether -- so you just hear the chat in the lobby.* Mute button* Surround sound is good ... you can tell where the bad guys are coming fromCONS:Sound quality is good -- but not amazing. But remember that these are wireless. The wired headphones have a bit of an advantage in overall sound quality.Tip: With the Turtle Beach X3s, unlike ALL of the other headphones, under the "voice" personal options 360 menu, select the default "Play Voice through Headset" and not "both headset and speakers."You are going to love these headphones.
