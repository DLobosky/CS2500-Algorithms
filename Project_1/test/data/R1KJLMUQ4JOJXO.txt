The first part of this review focuses on the series, and the second part focuses on season 2 in particular.I won't go too much into the story as 200 people have already done that, but Dexter is a Miami cop (a lab nerd, really, he analyzes blood spatters) who moonlights as a serial killer. The twist is, he only murders "bad" people (most of whom he finds via his job working in homocide). The series explores how Dexter, who feels very little emotion, blends in with society and "fakes" being human, with some interesting and sometimes comical results. Aside from the aspect of the show incorporating Dexter's struggle to fit in with society, I completely disagree with all the reviews that claim Dexter provides a view "inside the mind of a serial killer". Please - Dexter is fiction in the truest since of the word, the series isn't realistic, which is fine with me because as far as I can tell it isn't trying to be realistic. If you want to get "inside the mind" of a killer, you shouldn't be looking to fiction (instead watch any of the number of true crime shows on channels such as A&E, or watch HBO's excellent interviews of The Iceman, which are available on DVD via Amazon or a good rental store/website). But you are truly doing yourself a great disservice if you are fooling yourself into thinking this fictitious story represents the mind of a killer - real serial killers really are monsters, and Dexter has more in common with Batman than most real world serial killers.  This paragraph wasn't meant to detract from the show, as I don't think it's creators are trying to realistically portray a serial killer, but rather to address what I think are some misleading reviews.Rather, the gist of this story is a tale, or rather a question, of morality: is Dexter good or evil? Sure, he's a bloodthirsty serial killer who brutally hacks his victims apart, and he takes enjoyment in it. But his victims are people that the world is better off without, and whom the criminal justice system has failed to get off the streets. And, while he may be emotionally detached, when he's not hacking people up he's an all around pretty decent guy (good brother, good boyfriend, good son, good employee, good "father figure" to his girlfriend's kids ...), and he lives by a strict, if bizarre, ethical code, which is more than we can say for most of us. If you have a somewhat dark sense of humor and an open mind (no this isn't a straight up comedy, but there are a number of comical elements), then definately check Dexter out. I think this is a very entertaining series, one of the best currently on television and certainly worth watching if you can deal with a little gore and a somewhat disturbing subject matter.  This definately brings Showtime onto my radar screen, as Dexter rivals many of the excellent series found on HBO.*******************Season 2 specifically:I'm not going to go into too much detail on the story, as several reviewers have already done so (and some have IMO given away far too much of the story, thanks for the spoilers, guys).  But in Season 2, the focus at the Miami PD is the search for Dexter himself - that's right, some of his victims have been, err, discovered, and the search is on for a serial killer even more deadly than The Ice Truck Killer.  Dexter, naturally, views the investigation from the inside, with some interesting results.  On his personal life, Dexter developes hugely as a person - by the end of the series, he almost seems human.  Overall, Dexter is a very good show and Season 2 is just as good as Season 1, though the introduction of a new love interest gets old fast, and adds an almost soap-opera like aspect of the show that I didn't really like.  But if you enjoyed Season 1, definately continue the series into it's second season.  I'll be looking forward to a third season.
