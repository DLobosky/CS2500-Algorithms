I first read this book back in 2005 and have never written a review for it.  I just finished reading it again this evening and I have to say that it was awesome this time around as well lol.  I read it so long ago that I completely forgot some of the characters and most of the plot!  This book is definitely a keeper.  The characters were brought to life which made the story enjoyable.  There were no editing issues and the plot was really tight.  Darien and Maxwell had a lot of chemistry which made the story really HOT!  I had a hard time putting this book down, but you know I have to eat and sleep as well lol. I love Leslie's writing style so I'm off to read some of her other books. :)
