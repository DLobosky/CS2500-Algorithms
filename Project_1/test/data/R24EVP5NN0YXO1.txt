This is one of those books where your interpretation changes as you yourself change.  I guess that means that you have less sympathy for the character, an angst ridden adolescent, the older and more mature you get.  Yogi Berra said it best....to paraphrase &quot;I thought Catcher in the Rye was about baseball,                                         but it was just about some whiny kid.&quot;                                        That being said, the book, released in the early 1950's, portrays Holden Caulfied as the                                         paradoxical &quot;all-knowing/totally confused&quot; adolescent. The story takes place over a period                                         of several days after Caulfield has been expelled from prep school. His cynical                                         observations on his sorry state of affairs and his contempt for teachers, phonies and                                         apparently all adults in general ring amazingly contemporary despite the book's being nearly                                         50 years old.                                        I read this book in college, then later as a married adult and parent. It speaks volumes to                                         the alienation of youth in a fast-paced engaging prose. For those who read this growing up,                                         it is worth another look from an adult perspective. You'll be amazed at how different your                                         reaction will be from the first time you read it.
