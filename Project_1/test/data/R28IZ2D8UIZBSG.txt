Real quick, I want to say that the 'one' star I'm giving this film goes WHOLE heartedly to Peter Dinklage.  In my opinion, he's like the 3M Company, in that he might not create the scene, but he sure does make the scene better.Virtually everything in the movie that he does, I get.  And I get the whole 'I want to be left alone' thing that he does throughout the movie.  What I don't get, is why the people around him can't respect that.  All that seems to go on with the two other main characters is that they want to ingratiate themselves on him, and for what purpose I'd like to know?And the thing with the hotdog vendor, you mean to tell me that he's from Manhattan, where there's probably a million people wandering the streets, and he's going to set up shop at a nowhere spot in the middle of nowhere?  How's he supposed to make money? Come on!And that's another problem with the screenplay.  I mean, is the Peter Dinklage character supposed to be independently weatlthy or something?  How does he get his money for stuff--like the coffee and ALL those cigarettes?And how does the Bobby Cannavale character suppose to live in Manhattan (of all places) if he can't even sell enough coffee to fill his gas tank?This movie, I don't know?  It left a lot of questions for me.  I couldn't even get into the Patricia Clarkson character very much.  I mean, I know she's hurting because she lost her son.  But, I think it was the way the movie presented this plight.  I mean, it's kinda hard to feel anything, when we (the audience) didn't have the chance to know her son too.  (I mean, it's just the way things should be presented in a movie--so you get to feel for and grow with the characters.)  I can't see where this was done right with this movie.All in all, I hate it when filmmakers go about making these 'quirky' little movies that don't really say very much and don't do very much.  I mean, remember when a 'quirky' movie was something like that gem of a movie:  Harold & Maude.  Or maybe even the original version of Sweet November?  Now that's the kind of quirk that I can get into--quirk with a point.  Quirk with great story telling.  I don't know what the Station Agent was trying to tell?Either way, if you want to see Peter Dinklage in something good, then PLEASE check out his performance in Season 4 of Nip/Tuck.  In my opinion, he made the WHOLE season.  Peter Dinklage is what great acting is all about.  Can't wait to see what he does next!!!
