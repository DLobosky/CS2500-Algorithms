These are not your teenage vampires, they are compelling characters, and it's a fascinating look at life in the deep south.  When I described this show to a friend, I called it "the sexiest show on television" and I stand by that.  It's not really because of the occasional nudity though, it's because these actors are so good, they make these characters and their situations "real."  Yes, there are supernatural beings in their Louisiana world, but it's not really about that.  It's about relationships and problems and the deep south and all of the flavor of the "real" world, with a little twist that keeps things fresh and the action going.They do "desire" REALLY well, everyone from the actors to the directors and writers and everyone in between just does a fine job with this, and it's very sexy and compelling.  It's also filled with action and danger, prejudice, hate, bigotry, love, and very different "people" learning to deal with one another.  The DVD's have very good commentary, and it's obvious how much these people care about their show, and how much they appreciate one another.  They give you a lot of inside information and stay on track while commenting, with interesting little side information.  It's eye-opening to listen to the mix of accents and voices of these people who do an amazing job with those southern accents on screen, because on the DVD you will hear very different voices and accents.I have to say once again that the cast is simply amazing.  I appreciate the faces that move (rather than botox robots) and the bodies of real people without a lot of silicone, or plumped lips, and and "Hollywood" ideas about beauty.  It's just so refreshing to see a production that finds beauty in normal looking people (although yeah, there are many stunning men and women in the cast.)  My ONLY complaint is that there is no "gag real" because?  C'mon guys!  That would have been wonderful.
