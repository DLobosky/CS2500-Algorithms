I enjoyed this move alot.  I love the show so I love the movie.  Although the show and the movie didnt have much in common with each other,  I thought that the movie was good.  My freind and I watch this movie all the time.  We absolutly love it.  Another movie that I would recomend is the cardcaptors movie.
