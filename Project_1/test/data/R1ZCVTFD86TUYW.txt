The features are great and they are waterproof - for a while.  None of these has ever been abused, just worn and never in water deeper than 10 feet (a mere 3.3 meters).  One of them, worn into a swimming pool, came out full of water and completely non-functional.  Fortunately it was under warranty, but it still cost $7 to have repaired/replaced.  Two others are older than one year, but less than two, and have started becoming foggy after swimming (pool, not ocean).  The fog evaporates after an hour or so, indicating that water can not only get in, but that it can get out.  The last is only six months old and fine so far, but I do not expect it to last much longer--it too will likely leak just after the warranty expires.  For the cost of these things and the claim that they are "waterproof to 100 m," they are incredibly unreliable long-term.
