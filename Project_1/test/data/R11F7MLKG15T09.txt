Her life has been one of solitude ever since the cancerous death of her mentor, Father Mullond.  A new menace is now drawing her, practically daring her to defeat it.  But Gaby is reluctantly developing ties as she discovers she now has a friend in her landlord, Mort Vance, and a startling attraction to Detective Luther Cross. Will these new ties only serve to hamper Gaby or will she begin to trust in others about her divine calling?     SERVANT: THE AWAKENING is the first book in what is sure to be an electrifying series.  L.L. Foster (aka Lori Foster) delves deeply into the dark side with this supernaturally charged tale.  Gaby is a haunted and almost tragic figure, isolated and alone.  She has a sharp bluntness that is appealing as she lacks the usual social skills.  Her angst enhances the storyline as there is a real reason behind her feelings of dread.  L.L. Foster does an exceptional job at character development as she makes Gaby likeable despite Gaby's determined efforts to be unlikable.     THE AWAKENING has a hint of romance brewing in it but is definitely an urban fantasy.  Luther is attracted to Gaby despite all of his misgivings, while Gaby is reluctantly drawn towards the detective with a nose for trouble.  Their personalities couldn't be any more different and yet, somehow, it all works.  Don't mistake THE AWAKENING for a paranormal romance, however, as L.L. Foster takes readers into a haunting, shadowy world with this tale.     L.L. Foster brings a fresh perspective to the urban fantasy genre with THE AWAKENING.  Despite the plethora of books available in the genre, THE AWAKENING has that extra bite that makes it stand out.  L.L. Foster shows she has an edgy, dangerous side in this first, fascinating start to the series.  One can easily envision a graphic novel accompanying this fantastic book, as it has that gritty feel to it.  I can't wait to see where L.L. Foster takes this series!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES
