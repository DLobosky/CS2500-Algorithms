Based on the series of books my son is a huge fan of, Diary of the Wimpy Kid, this poster captures a lot of fun doodles.  My son was super excited to get this in the mail.  It was preserved and shipped nicely in a poster tube and came wrinkled free and ready to hang!  Definitly a great poster for any young fan of the book!  I'll do anything to keep my little guy encouraged about reading!
