I purchased this card for my Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and my Sanyo Xacti VPC-E2 Digital Camcorder and 8 MP Digital Camera (Blue).  Now I can take about 4000+ pictures depending on the size and quality of the image (never have taken that many) and be able to record hours of videos.The hassle free packaging is an answer to my prayers - less fuss less waste, thanks Amazon.  Now if we can just get you to send items in smaller boxes or envelopes.  :-)Make sure to get a card reader such as the Transcend TS-RDM3K All in 1 USB 2.0 Multi Card Reader (Black).  Makes it easier to view and upload photos/videos from the card instead of hooking up the camera to your PC via cables.
