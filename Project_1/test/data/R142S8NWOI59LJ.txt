If you're just shooting still pics, or lower resolution video, this card is likely overkill and the SanDisk Ultra (Class 4) is plenty fast. The exception would be a D-SLR shooting rapid bursts of stills in RAW mode where this card would likely speed things up. But for shooting JPGs, or anything but full 1080HD video, you're unlikely to notice any difference between this card and the Ultra.If you read the reviews here, and elsewhere, you'll find lots of frustrated people who got an error recording 1080HD several minutes into a video. Sometimes their card ended up corrupted, and in some cases, they even lost EVERYTHING on the card. That can happen when you use a card that can't keep up with your camera.While it's rated Class 6, the Extreme is far faster in testing than even most Class 10 cards from other companies. Using ATTO-DISK, the same benchmark software some of the pros use, this card clocks in around 30MB/sec write speeds (class 6 cards only have to meet a minimum of 6MB/sec).There are also some in-camera tests published that show SanDisk Ultra to be among the fastest. Plus you know SanDisk will honor the 30 year warranty unlike some of the no-name cards.Most Class 6 cards I've tested, including those from Transcend, Lexar and Kingston, only manage 10MB/sec - 15MB/sec on the exact same benchmark. So this SanDisk Extreme card is 5X faster than the spec, and 2X - 3X faster than competing Class 6 cards. But it does cost more.Also, for what it's worth, I've had cards from Transcend and A-Data fail. But I've never had a SanDisk or Kingston card fail despite getting heavier use. If you're shooting pics/video that are difficult (or impossible) to replace, it's worth spending more on a quality card.WARNING: Anything you put this card in (camera, PC, card reader, etc.) has to be SDHC compatible (usually it will say SDHC on it). Most things made in the last few years are, but not all. If you have a cheaper or older device that doesn't support SDHC, you're limited to a maximum size of 2GB. If you put a larger SDHC card into an older SD-only device, you could corrupt the card and lose everything on it.So it's best to experiment to make sure your device, PC, etc. are all SDHC compatible before you fill the card up with irreplaceable images/video only to lose everything by plugging this 8GB card into your 4 year old PC's 2GB reader.
