The story is dominated by two-dozen of the honest-to-God dumbest, one-dimensional archetypes possible (even the innocent ones), and their dialogue mocks the reader's intellect. It was difficult to care whether or not people this stupid survived the ordeal. They are so inexcusably brainless I wonder if Stephen King believes the residents of rural Maine are fundamentally retarded because that is how he has portrayed them.The concept of putting a group of people under the duress of self-containment isn't new, but King adds a supernatural twist. Fair enough -- this is Stephen King after all -- but it offers a convenient and trite explanation and conclusion. Stephen King proclaimed a lot of trees would be killed in order to publish this book due to it's length. I think it tortured and killed a lot of my brain cells as well.
