The only downside was at least twice (pages 196 and 216,) there was a little too much pondering going on in Matthew's mind.Story brief:  Matthew's father was in debt due to gambling.  He was killed by a robber and Matthew is trying to run the estate.  On his deathbed, the father told Matthew he had won a fortune and buried it in the garden, but he died before he could clearly explain where it was buried.  For a year, Matthew has been digging through the garden hoping to find the money.  If he doesn't find it, he will need to marry an heiress.  He has invited some single women and men to his estate for several days in hopes of finding a suitable heiress.  Carolyn was invited and brings her sister Sarah as her traveling companion.Sarah is plain looking with thick spectacles and an outspoken nature.  She is used to being a wallflower and ignored by men.  I enjoyed the following conversation (page 37-38) which describes part of her.  I liked her a lot in this story.  Matthew is walking his dog Danforth.  He sees her as he is walking through the gardens and out of politeness talks briefly with her for a few minutes.  As he leaves he says     ""If you'll excuse me, Miss, um ---  He cleared his throat and coughed.  "Danforth and I shall continue our walk."     She tilted her head and rested her gaze on him with a disconcerting penetrating look that made him feel as if he were a pane of glass she could see right through.  "You don't know my name, do you?"     It was a statement rather than a question, and to his annoyance, he felt heat flush his face - which only added to his annoyance that she was right.  "Of course I know who you are.  You're Lady Wingate's sister."     "Whose name you can't recall."  Before he could make any attempt at politeness or even admit she was correct, she waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. "Please don't concern yourself.  It happens all the time.  I'm Sarah Moorehouse, my lord."     (It happens all the time.  He thinks.)       Matthew wasn't certain whether it was her words or the matter-of-fact manner in which she stated them that had him regarding her more carefully.  Yes, he could see how this unremarkable woman could and would be overlooked - a state of affairs to which she'd obviously inured herself. --- For some inexplicable reason, he was suddenly reluctant to leave." CAUTION SPOILER:Page 104.Matthew says "I want to kiss you."A frown creased Sarah's brow.  "You're joking.""I'm not.""Don't be ridiculous."Again, I'm not.""This morning you couldn't recall my name.""I recall your name now."  His gaze again dipped to her lips.  "Miss Sarah Moorehouse.""Then you must be foxed.""I'm not.  Are you?""Certainly not. I'm -""As curious as I am?"  He cupped her face between his hands ---"DATA:Sexual language: mild.
