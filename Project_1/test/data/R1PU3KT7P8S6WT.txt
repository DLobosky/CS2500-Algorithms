Longman's book is a helpful guide, and the latest edition includes many new books, not reviewed in the 2nd edition. At times I wish that Longman would clue us in more on the theological stance of the books he recommends, but overall his book is an indispensable guide to the bewildering array of books available on the Old Testament.I appreciate his ratings, including the 1 to 5 star system, and the rating of the work as suitable for Layperson, Minister or Scholar. An additional aid would be a rating of the scholarship's place on the continuum of conservative to critical approach.Highly recommended.
