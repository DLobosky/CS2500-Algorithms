Charles Spurgeon is one of the greatest ministers of the reformed  church.   Many of the words he speaks are authoratative and very commendable.  In  reading this book I found it interesting how he defined the Holy Spirit in  six steps and then explained how we may use the gift of the Spirit to the  glory of God.  This book is very comprehensable and to the point.  If you  purchase and read this book be ready for a new outlook on the gifts of God.
