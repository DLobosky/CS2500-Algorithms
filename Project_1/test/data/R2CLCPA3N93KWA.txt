Apparently if you lump any 4 guys together on a road trip, there is going to be a lot of homophobic hi-jinks. There was so much gay slander jokes in this movie, it really got old quickly. The movie execs must believe the average American movie watcher obviously has the IQ of a caveman, sorry to any cavemen I've offended. The movie also has a lot of slapstick humor, making a Jerry Lewis type character out of William Macy. He klutzes everything up from fights to riding the motorcycle to dancing, to eating chili. This movie could have been about a mid life crisis and taken the subject seriously, and may have gotten a movie that was somewhat thoughtful or interesting. Instead what you have here is a stereo-typing four stooges on Harleys with a good dose of homophobic humor thrown in.
