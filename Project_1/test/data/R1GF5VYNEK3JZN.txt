The raid, largely pushed forward at the insistence of Winston Churchill, was poorly planned and generally poorly executed (but the actual soldiers and sailor involved displayed a tremendous amount of courage!), and was largely a disaster, albeit on a relatively small scale.After the unexpected fall of Tobruk to the Germans/Italians in June 1942, the road to Egypt was opened to Rommel's Panzer Army Afrika.  Churchill was shocked that Tobruk fell, and pressed the commanders in the Mediterranean to try to block Tobruk and Benghazi harbors, and when that proved impractial, to raid and destroy them as much as possible so as to deny their use to the Axis, almost regardless of the cost.  Like many of Churchill's ideas, they were theoretically sound on the surface, but in reality, very impractical.  However, he was able to browbeat his commanders into attempting it.  While the raid on Benghazi was converted to a raid from the desert only, the raid against Tobruk involved the Long Range Desert Group, the SAS, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Army, the Royal Marines, and the Royal Navy ... indeed a combined arms effort.The raid against Benghazi had only mixed results, but the raid against Tobruk was, if not actually a massacre as per the title of the book, then a solid thrashing.  The author points out that while there were many things that contributed to the British defeat, such as improper planning, insufficient training, and an inadequate number of barely seaworth landing boats, the biggest factor was that the RAF bombed Tobruk for several hours before the seaborne portion of the raid commenced.  Far from crippling the defenders, this air raid ensured that the German and Italian defenders were awake and alert.  Oddly enough, a month earlier the Canadians were badly repulsed at Dieppe, and one of the factors for their defeat was that the RAF had bombed there, too, shortly before the Canadian landings.  This lesson unfortunately didn't carry over to Operation Agreement, the code name for this raid on Tobruk.All in all, the British lost two destroyers, one cruiser, numerous motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and small landing craft, and about 600 men killed, wounded, or captured.  While this was a severe toll based on the number of men involved, it was only a relative drop in the bucket against the larger picture of the war.  The sadly ironic thing, though, is that according to the author, even if the raid had succeeded to the degree it's planners hoped, it would have only cost the Germans/Italians about 3 days worth of supplies before they would have had the harbor running again.  I think the reason this raid isn't better known in the English speaking world is because it was a failure that had no measurable impact on the desert campaign, except perhaps to give the Italians their last victory in the war.The book is primarily written from the British perspective, with about 95 percent of the anecdotes from the British side.  There are a few anecdotes from the German side, as well as some analysis from their point of view, but this is mostly a British tale.  That's not a problem, mind you, I just point it out as part of this review. There are a good many pictures in the book, from both sides, and they add to the narritive.I do have a couple of nits.  First, the writing can be a bit on the dry side.  It won't put you to sleep, but some sections are relatively hard slogging.  And second, I'm fairly tolerant of typos, but there seem to be a lot more in this book than the norm, mostly missing prepositions or wrong word choices.  Again, these are just nits and shouldn't sway you against this book which I recommend.As an aside, I'm glad that Stackpole books has taken the effort and financial risk to re-publish so many good books, such as this one, that have long been out of print that provide a lot of information on some of the lesser known actions of World War II.
