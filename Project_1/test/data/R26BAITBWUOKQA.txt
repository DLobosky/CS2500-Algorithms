The friendly visitors offer to help humanity fight off these would be conquerors but things never quite seem to work out right. Partly this is because the technology of the invaders is generally superior to that of the humans. Partly this is because the other side is heedless of casualties. In great measure, though, human losses are due to the corrupt leaders of the planet and its military. The leaders are a privileged class. They rule the planet for their own benefit and most of the soldiers are "vat grown" to act as serfs and/or cannon fodder. They are aided by genetically enhanced bats and rats with artificially enhanced IQs. None of this, however, seems to be enough to face the enemy.One Vat, along with his rat and bat companions, becomes cut off behind enemy lines. In his efforts to get free, he learns to befriend the uplifted animals conscripted to serve beside him and, in doing so, create complete chaos for the enemy. He also learns that not all enemies are as bad as they are cracked up to be and neither are the allies.This is a comedy posing as an adventure story. As long as it is not taken too seriously, it is lots of fun.
