The whole first season cost less than these 14 episodes, so save some money and buy the first season Rocko's Modern Life-Season 1 Disc-1 1.No pain, no gain (Rocko and Heffer join an exclusive health club, so Heffer can lose weight) 2.Who gives a buck? (Rocko gets a new credit card and goes on a shopping spree) 3.Jet stream (Rocko and Heffer fly an economy airline but Heffer sneaks into first class) 4.Dirty dog (Rocko tries to rid spunky of parasites) 5.Keeping up with the bigheads (Rocko and Heffer hurry to fix up Rocko's house before its condemed ) 6.Skid marks (Rocko's car gets towed because of a missing gas cap) Disc-2 1.The good, the bad and the wallaby (Heffer tries fitting in with real cattle) 2.Trash-o-madness (Rocko tries to avoid the ferocious dog "earl" while setting out his trash for garbage pick up) 3.Power trip (Rocko's put in charge of the comic book store) 4.To heck and back (Heffer has a near death experience after choking on a chicken bone) 5.Spitballs(Ed Bighead destroys Rocko's prized foul baseball) 6.Popcorn pandemonium (The googaplex movie theater popcorn machine pops everyone out of theater) 7.Cabin fever (The Bigheads, Rocko and Heffer share the same cabin for a weekend)8.Rinse and spit (Rocko agrees to be Filburts dental exam patient)I hope these dvd sets sell enough for Amazon to quickly offer my other favorites "The rugrats" "Catdog" and "The Angry beavers" season sets...
