I bought this tent for a camping trip in the Adirondacks. It held up well during a whole day of heavy downpours. There were a few drops of water that somehow seemed to make their way through both the rain tarp and the mesh of the actual tent itself, so that every few minutes, water drops would fall on us. But for the price, I can't complain. The top half of the actual tent itself is mostly made of a mosquito mesh like material. So you definitely need to put the rain tarp over it if you think it might rain. If you want some sun, just take off the tarp, and the sun will shine right through.This is not a backpacking tent. It is too big and heavy to carry as a back country tent. For those situations you might want to look for a lighter model. But if you are camping close to your car, this is great.There is no separate ground tarp. The bottom of the tent is designed to be a ground tarp. I wish more tents would do this. The tent is big enough for five people to hang out in it and play cards. Four people can also lie down in it with their sleeping bags, but it's a cozy fit. This is a free standing tent. This means you don't need to use guy wires to keep it standing, though they are provided to give your tent more rigidity.The bag that the tent came with is absolutely too small. Once you take it out of the bag, there is no way you can get it back in the bag. Trust me. I tried rolling the tent, folding the tent, crumpling the tent, but no matter what, it is impossible to get it back into the tent bag. I ended up using one of those canvas bags you get when you buy folding beach chairs. Overall, I recommend it for those of you who like to camp close to their car or camper, where size or weight isn't an issue.=============================Edit on June 24, 2009:My above review was from July 2007. I have now had this tent for two more years and have taken it on a couple more camping trips. It has held together well under the rain and is still going strong, and surprising does not have the plasticy smell that some tents have. However, my caution would be that I have in total only spend six nights in this tent. So I can't attest to it's durability for more frequent campers. But for once a year campers like me, this is a great cheap tent. One thing to note is that this is not a fall or winter tent. Due to all the mesh in the top half of the tent, it will not hold any heat.
