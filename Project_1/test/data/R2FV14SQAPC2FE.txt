This is easily arguable and when comparing the amount of content in an expansion pack versus a stuff pack and then the price comparison you are indeed better off buying the expansions. BUT, sometimes you are in the market for something in particular. Yes, there are many custom content creators out there who can rival EA for quality and value, but not everyone is comfortable downloading custom content and others prefer knowing the content they get is going to be completely game compatible. That is when stuff packs are the most useful.All that said... Teen Style Stuff is my first stuff pack purchase. I've been interested in other stuff packs but the price has made them not essential to my gaming experience. The gothic furniture was my main interest but the socialite and sporty styles were also a draw. With Teen Style Stuff the pack does stress the teenaged sims. There are new full body outfits for teen males and females, new pajamas and work-out wear for girls and work-out wear for boys. A handful of new hairstyles, which include styles with visors and trucker hats. These visor and hat styles do match with the outfits for the teens. In addition to these there are items for practical use such as beds, end tables, chairs, lamps, a tv, a radio and a computer. You'll also get a lot of decorative items including a 'rug' that looks like a clothes strewn on the floor. Lastly, there are wallpapers and floors to match it all. (For screenshots and pictures of the items mentioned you can check EA's The Sims 2 website or google for them).After loading this stuff pack up into my game I sat down and played with the available items, including making new teen sims with the hairstyles and clothing. The clothing choices I very much liked though they were pretty much color variations on the same small handful of styles (but that's how it is with the game anyway). The hairstyles didn't thrill me really, but the hat options were fitting with current trends. As far as the items go, I had fun creating a couple of bedrooms with them and I liked that while there were three different styles most items could be mixed around between them to some extent. The only things I wasn't really impressed with were the flooring options. The carpets did not match very well with the wallpapers in my opinion. Overall, I am very pleased with this stuff pack. I was able to purchase mine for the $15.99 price here on Amazon which is a bit better of a price than the $19.99. If you know what you're getting the price shouldn't be a deterant. I chose this pack because I felt it had the most items I would actually enjoy and make use of, and it is just what I was hoping it would be. This might be Teen Style Stuff but the decorative items and practical items would be perfect for children and even dorm rooms if you have the University expansion. This is not the stuff pack for you if you do not play many child, teen or young adult sims.
