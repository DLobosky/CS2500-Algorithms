I upgraded from MSFT Money. The "translation" involved 19 pages of errors. I am ready to pull my hair out. This book does not even mention moving from Money to Quicken! The "Quicken 2010, The Official Guide," does talk a bit about the translation. Bottomline: Quicken does not handle CASH in an investment account, which is where I got messed up. I finally UNINSTALLED Quicken and revived my old Money to finish off the year. Neither book could "fix" any of the mess which came through the change. I might try to start from scratch for year 2011 using Quicken. There is NO EASY way to move from Money to Quicken unless all you have is a checking account...in which case you don't need Quicken anyway...all you need is paper, pen, and a calculator.
