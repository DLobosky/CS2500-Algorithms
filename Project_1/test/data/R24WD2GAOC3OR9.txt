This book should be on every junior high and high school reading list. It is true feminism on the American frontier -- a woman who won't accept "her place" in a man's world because it doesn't fit her agenda. Mattie Ross is out to avenge the murder of her father "in the Choctaw Nation when snow was on the ground."I get chills even now from the memory of reading the serialized novel as a kid in the pages of "The Saturday Evening Post." Mattie Ross's harrowing experience in the rattlesnake pit was the most exciting thing I had ever read. It frustrates me now that I'm spending this time writing about a book that's been all but forgotton by succeeding generations. Everyone deserves to experience "True Grit."   It's the kind of unputdownable book that can make even the most X-boxed kid of the G4 generation want to put down their controller and read for a few hours.What has diminished this book's reputation over time has been the residual effect of a movie that fell far short of its potential, lapsing frequently into broad stereotypes. In the novel the narrative style fits Mattie Ross's character perfectly. The precise and opinionated spinster who tells the tale religiously avoids the crude employment of contractions in her sentences. Every "isn't" becomes an "is not," and every "he's" becomes a "he is." No one drops their "Gs" at the ends of words. While this sounds totally proper coming from Mattie's prim narrative, some Hollywood bumbler injudiciously decided to keep this mannered speech in the screenplay. Not just in Mattie's speeches but in those of Rooster Cogburn (John Wayne), LeBouef (Glen Campbell), Lucky Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall) and the rest of the baddies throughout the Oklahoma Territory. The result is a series of stiltifying portrayals where the rough cobs of the plains sound like Sunday School teachers. Kim Darby's earnest performance as Mattie Ross is lost in this morass. One is left with the sense from the film that the acting is just generally bad but the movie simply suffers from a screenwriter who just doesn't seem to know where the words are coming from.So why do I make a big deal about the movie when I'm talking about the novel? Only to make the point that you should not let negative feelings about the film deter you from the book. Ironically and somewhat sadly, perhaps the best hope for the future of Portis's work is that another movie version might one day be made, bringing the story again before the public eye. (Are you listening, Mister Eastwood?) After all, shouldn't movie remakes be made of movies that didn't quite get it right the first time? Kurosawa could have done the story justice by setting the film in Japan. So too could Ang Lee. The story is a universal one that transcends cultures. Nonetheless, Portis's novel is a winning and articulate vision of a changing American West. It is one of the important novels in its genre -- one which does not deserve the fate of being ignored. All that aside -- it's a GREAT read!
