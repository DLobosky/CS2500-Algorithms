I had been warned about this by previous customer reviews but decided to purchase one anyway with the hopes that mine would be different. Wrong. Thank goodness for Photoshop's Dust &amp; Scatches filter which corrects the problem, though obviously does not solve it. Methinks another scanner is warranted...
