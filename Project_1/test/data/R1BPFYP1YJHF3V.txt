The serrated portion of the blade is short and too close to the body to be of real use. The phillips is one of the few on a multitool that's appropriately sized for real work. The bottle opener is similarly sturdy and big enough. Ditto the large flat head on the opposite side. Only thing missing is a small flat head. There is also no file but I've never used a file on any multitool in my life. The pliers are difficult to open but are well built and solid. Wire cutters arent sharp and dont close deep enough to actually snip things. One of the best features of this tool is that only the pliers are on the inside, in other words you only have to open it up for one tool: the pliers.All other tools can be easily accessed from the outside which is a good thing because the pliers open so poorly. Its awkward to handle with the belt clip but that can be easily removed if you have a tiny torx driver. As clunky as this tool is I would not keep it on me. I'd always be worried it will break in an emergency and its not versatile enough for daily carry. Too few functions for being so large and heavy. It wont sit in your pocket comfortably and its not good enough to warrant a belt holster. Gave it two stars because its not complete garbage.
