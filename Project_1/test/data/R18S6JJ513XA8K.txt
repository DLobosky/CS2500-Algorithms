I am very happy with this wireless router.  After a very sour experience with our phone/internet provider where I was billed 750$ for a month of overseas call, I finally cut the service and when with another one.  So, I need a new router.  I did some research of my own and ended up buying this one.I have 2 PC desktops, Xbox, Wii, iPad, iPod Touch and an old Macbook.  I live in a moderately sized 3-story townhouse with 2-car garages.  I have tried the signal on all floors and consistently gets 5 bars. Before, I have intermittent connection when I go to our master bedroom.  I went to our deck and in front of the garage - still getting strong signals.The set-up is fairly easy. You have to run a CD that came with the router to 1 computer for registering and configuration.I am amazed how small and thin this router is.  It also has several extra ethernet ports at the back to connect computers directly if you want to.This router is also running our Ooma telephone system, four years and runnng.
