Mr. Mantis is their scout leader, but he sprained his thorax, so Holley ends up leading the scouts.Holley has his doubts. He's never done anything like this before and isn't even sure if he can make it to the top. He and the kids learn that sticking together is the best plan.A reasonably pleasing adaptation of the TV story. Shows readers that if they put in the effort, they can come out on top. And parents can often be that helping hand in ensuring that success.
