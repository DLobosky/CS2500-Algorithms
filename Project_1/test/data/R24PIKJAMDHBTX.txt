I wanted to find a grease that was odorless and also nontoxic so did a little research and found that "Food Grade" grease was what I needed. There are a few lubrication products on the market from different manufacturers that are food grade but Amazon carried this brand so I ordered it.I'm very happy with this product, it's odorless and since it is registered as a NSF H1 class lubricant it is very safe. I use this on some parts of my car like door hinges, power window rails/rollers, sliding cables etc. Prior to this I used a Gunk White Lithium grease which made my car smell HORRIBLE for months. Keep in mind this is a light duty grease that should not be used where very high temperatures are observed, for example disc brake parts. This grease can be used in and around the home too. It sprays on wet so it is able to penetrate tight spaces but when it dries it becomes a creamy texture. I highly recommend this product for those who are sensitive to chemical odors like myself.
