I bought this book "iMovie HD 6 & iDVD 6", which is written by Jeff Carlson, because I was learning how to use iMovie HD 6. I also bought another book "iMovie 6 & iDVD: The Missing Manual" which is written by David Pogue.  This book by Jeff Carlson looks like it is quicker to go through where almost every page has a bulleted  how-to-do-it with tips visual format. This would be an easy book for beginners.  If you want a meatier book with much more details, then David Pogue's missing manual book is better.  If you want a basic how-to book, then this book by Jeff Carlson is for you.  Although I got this for use with iMovie HD 6, I also actually have iMovie '08 and I got the other book "iMovie '08 & iDVD: The Missing Manual".  I may get the similar "visual quickstart guide" book for iMovie '08.  Anyways, having started with iMovie '08, when I found out iMovie HD 6 had more sophisticated features than iMovie '08 like the editing timeline and the ability to take plugins, I had to get iMovie HD 6. iMovie '08 is so different from iMovie HD 6 that users complained about features that were missing in iMovie '08. Apple relented and provided a free download of iMovie HD 6 to those who had iMovie '08. However, when iMovie '09 was released, Apple then later removed their official iMovie HD 6 download because the newly released iMovie '09 included many of the features (but still no plugins) left out of iMovie '08 that users of iMovie HD 6 wanted. Well, I don't have iMovie '09, but only had iMovie '08. Although Apple removed their official download for iMovie HD 6 which I wanted, all I had to do is to use Google to search for the iMovieHD6.dmg file to find where other iMovie users had unofficially posted the file. So I downloaded the file and installed iMovie HD 6 on my Macbook. I had the editing timeline back that I was more familiar with when I was editing video under Windows. And I could do plugins. Yea! So, I'm using both iMovie HD 6 and iMovie '08 along with QuickTime by going back and forth with the video because each does something that the other one doesn't. As for this book, "iMovie HD 6 & iDVD 6" by Jeff Carlson, I ordered a "used" version of the book for $6.72 plus $3.99 S&H from an Amazon marketplace seller who was selling the book here on Amazon. I received the book in a week's time and it looked new except for a back bottom corner but otherwise in great condition. Used books are great purchases here on Amazon. Thanks for reading.
