It upconverts your standard definition DVDs nicely and will give you a list features that will make the delight of any AV enthusiast. It does output 1080p image and that alone is a great thing to see.GOOD POINTS (something that can make you buy it)-Upconversion of standard definition DVDs.-Outputs 1080p.-Lan connection for online software updates.-It supports HDMI 1.3.-Beautiful looking player.-Good remote control.-Price (compared to other Blu-ray stand alone players only).BAD POINTS (something that will make you buy other Blu-ray model or go HD DVD)-No dual stream video decoding, for PiP and other advanced interactive functions (only available in HD DVD players).-It decodes only old codecs DD and DTS, with the only next-gen format being DD+ which is lossy. -No support for lossless decoding of TruHD (I believe you must buy a new receiver for that part).-Region coding (if you only care for "Zone-A" discs, this may not be a problem for you. Otherwise you may try HD DVD which is a region free format).-Blu-ray Java at player profile1.0, which does not include the capabilities available elsewhere. This is a half-developed minimum player profile. Two more BD player profiles are being developed now (1.1 has been delayed 6 months. 2.0 has no release date announced.-Price (compared to the PS3 and HD DVD players).Still, for this price, this blu-ray player can be a good choice. Or you'll want to go for the cheaper PS3, or take a look at a HD DVD player.
