You cannot possibly imagine how heavy, though, until you own one and have to work it when you had a baby 4 weeks ago and need to deal with a carseat and toddler and this stroller at the same time.It is HUGE when folded, barely fits in the back of our Trailblazer.  It is HEAVY, especially to lift up and out and up and in the back of a vehicle.The only good thing was being able to use it with a car seat, but all the other downfalls make even this perk not worth it.  The baby actually liked being in the seat itself as a bassinet better than being in his carseat anyway.  I could not get the carseat back out without detaching the tray it attached to from the stroller either.The canopies are stingy and fall off when folded anyway and the toddler and rip his all the way forward and push it all the way back.  The trays come off when folded.  It is not comfortable for the toddler when the carseat is in the back and you can't see the baby that well in the carseat anyway.  The bars that keep the basket stiff are bent now due to the fact that they come unlatched, like they are supposed to for easy entry, when you fold the stroller.It doesn't fold and latch well because the wheels turn and get in the way.  It's all scraped up from the folding hassles.  The seats and belts are not comfortable.  The front seat is so shallow, although the toddler seemed comfortable enough.It did steer well and turned well.  The basket was very large and with the latch for easy access, did work well until the bars got bent.For our money, I'd have been better off getting the $400 side by side Zooper that I wanted, which holds a carseat, than wasting over $150 on this and now feeling that I had to buy another $200 side by side to be more convenient and practical.  Without using the carseat, we are better off with a side by side, as both kids can see and since the toddler can see his baby brother, he is not turning around all the time.The bottom line is, if you can wait or do without the carseat holding capability and get a good umbrella side by side, do it.  If you can't wait, get something else that will hold your carseat.  But, save your money on this.
