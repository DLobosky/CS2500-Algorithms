A collection of 50 photographers taking snaps of the theme of 'Tati', a Paris department store which first opened in 1948.  Some of the photos are very "store" related, but others you would never guess they went hand in hand with the retail chain Tati.   This book was only $...when new, and for it's size and photographs, it's a bargain.  I'd say only about half of the 100+ photos are interesting, but well worth the $5-$6 price you can find this book for used nowadays.  This book also contains two Martin Parr photographs of mannequins, and a bunch of employee candids taken by Catherine Deneuve.
