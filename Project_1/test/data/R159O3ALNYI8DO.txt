I would like to respond to the reviewers that suggest those of us who disliked babywise didn't read it, or didn't apply its principles properly.  I read, re-read and highlighted the book after a friend of mine recommended it.  And for a solid month I faithfully attempted to place my newborn on the babywise schedule, but it just did not work for my son.  For example, my son often awoke earlier from his nap than the schedule would allow.  Sometimes he would wake crying, sometimes happy.  If he was crying, I would allow him to cry because the book suggests if your baby awakes crying he did not get enough sleep.  But, he never fell back asleep.  So then I would feed him only to find he was starving. But how was I to know he was hungry...babwise never once discusses reading your baby's cues, only "mom, not baby, decides when nap begins, and mom, not baby, decides when nap ends."  If he woke happy, then I really was in a bind.  He would play awake in his crib (even if I didn't go to him) so now he was having activity before eating (a babywise no-no).  But if I fed him, he would be fed before 2 ½ hours (another babywise no-no).  I tried putting him to bed for naps earlier, because the book states that if your child awakes early he probably was overtired and needed less activity, but my son would still awake after 45-60 minutes.  I was constantly stressed out.After one month on babywise, my son was still not back to his birth weight.  I quit using the system and my son started rapidly gaining weight.  We both became happier.  I can't say I disagree with the overall concepts of the book...promoting full feedings instead of snacking, frequent daytime feedings to help baby distinguish day from night, teaching a baby to fall asleep on his/her own, and the importance of sleep to both a baby and his/her parents.  I just disagree with the presentation.  Babywise assumes all babies fit into its schedule, and in truth, they just don't.This is obviously a very controversial book.  I do not think you have to have an MD/PhD after your name to know something about raising a baby, but the fact that the author has absolutely no medical/childcare background concerns me, especially when the concepts are so radically different from what most pediatricians/child psychologists recommend.  Just because something works (i.e. gets you baby to sleep through the night), doesn't make it the best thing for your child.As a side note, I never co-slept or wore my baby in a sling all day long (though I feel if this works for you and your baby then great...this just isn't my style of parenting).  I definitely feel babies need parental guidance, but I think parents must take their baby's temperaments into account.  Once I started reading other books, I learned how to better read my babies cues, and I no longer had to fight him to sleep, eat or stay awake.  I used a combination of several other books (No Cry Sleep Solution, Sleep Lady's Gentle Guide and Baby Whisperer) and am happy to report I have a 9 month old who sleeps 11 hours per night and takes 2 good naps a day...oh and has been sleeping 10 hrs/night since 3 months of age. He is an absolute joy and everywhere I take him people comment on how happy and content he is...in church, restaurants and shopping.  It can be done without babywise!
