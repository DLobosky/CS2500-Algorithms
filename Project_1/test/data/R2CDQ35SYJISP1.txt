This is by far my favorite Dracula movie.  It was not copyrighted and was ordered to be destroyed in 1923.  It didn't happen for many copies.  This is a great movie and it would have been a tragedy to lose.  Way back in the day when 8mm home movie projectors were in vogue and my mother was a public librarian, my brother and I used to take the 8mm version of the movie and play and play it again.  We loved it and I continue that infatuation with the movie to the day.  This is great DVD version with tinting, wonderful music and a wonderful print.  The extras are terrific too.  I'm glad I got this DVD.
