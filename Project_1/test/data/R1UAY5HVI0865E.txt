It is outstanding on hamburgers, steaks, sandwiches...There is a hint of mustard heat, but this is not a Dijon style mustard. Those 11 herbs blend together to soften and make the mustard much more complex. There's no sharp vinegar flavor like with prepared mustards (better known as French's). It is simply heaven with a really nice steak. I love this product, only wish it came in much larger jars.
