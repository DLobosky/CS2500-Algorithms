The mark of an excellent piece of writing is the invisibility of the prose. Picking up a book and stumbling on the words, the phrases, the writing itself, always gets in the way of a good story. A well-written story creates a situation for the reader, where, for the most part, that necessary 'suspension of disbelief' occurs, and you find yourself lost in the world of the tale. It ceases to be merely reading and becomes something else. In Frank Huyler's The Blood of Strangers, the world of the emergency room emerges from the doctor's point of view with such terrifying reality, that putting the book down, taking a break, is utterly necessary to maintain one's own perspective, one's own reality. Huyler doesn't write prose, but conjures windows into another world.This book is a collection of scenes from the emergency room, revealing an aspect of the medicos that a lot of us would rather not know. First year medical students, for example, are assigned a cadaver to mutilate, take apart, to gain first hand knowledge of human anatomy. This the first of numerous hoops that the student of medicine must jump through in their many years of intense training. There is a tacit reason that anatomy is the first course off the rank - it is a test as to whether they have the capacity to objectify the body as mere object, divorce feeling and emotion from the human form itself. Many fail because they lack that 'scientific objectivity' and cannot stomach using a hack saw to open the skull of their subject. It is too close to home. The terrifying aspect of the Blood of Strangers is the objectivity portrayed by Dr. Huyler - he communicates a kind of cold bloodedness coupled with a profound insight and affinity with the human soul. He is at once human and inhuman, insensitive monster and caring priest - but above all, a man doing a job that most of us would rather leave to someone else.Most all the stories told have something to teach us about the profession. Medical doctors and surgeons are a breed apart - it is almost as if they are born to the task, and their power over life and death is profound. In one of the shorter stories, Sugar, a little girl is brought into the ER because she is just 'acting a bit weird'. The father wants to forget the whole thing and take her home, while the mother instinctively perceives something amiss. Dr. Huyler asks all the appropriate questions and comes up with nothing, until he is about to leave the room, he has a second thought: &quot;Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medication? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?&quot; As it turns out, through a process of logical interrogation, it is discovered that the little girl has overdosed on oral hypoglycemics, sugar pills, and would have died if not treated. This particular story is one of the lesser terrifying incidents, but shows us the fragility of the human condition and the vast responsibilty that burdens the medical profession.The Blood of Strangers is a realistic insight into the mind and experience of a doctor. The book is a strange journey for the uninitiated, and a lesson in the utter fragility of human life - something we should never take for granted.This book is highly recommended.
