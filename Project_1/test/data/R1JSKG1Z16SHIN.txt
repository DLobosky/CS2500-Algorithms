The Magdalene Sisters (Peter Mullan, 2002)Mullan, whose turns in front of the camera lend greatness to such films as Session 9, My Name Is Joe, and Young Adam, here delivers his first directorial effort in five years. While the movie falls short in a number of areas, it certainly achieves its intended effect: inciting an almost murderous rage in its viewers.The story centers around a particular Magdalene asylum (which one is never stated) to which, in 1964, three girls are sent for various things. They are Bernadette (Nor-Jane Noone of Ella Enchanted in her big screen debut), Margaret (Anne Marie Duff, recently in Enigma), and Rose (fellow first-timer Dorothy Duffy). The three of them try to survive as best they can. Among their fellow prisoners are the somewhat mentally challenged Crispina (Eileen Walsh, the title character in the recent Janice Beard: 45 Words a Minute), who ends up with as much screen time as any of the main characters. As the title suggests, though, the real main focus of the film is the sisters, led by the dictatorial Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan, portrayer of Lucia in "Mapp and Lucia"), and how they relentlessly brutalize the women under their purview.Mullan obviously has an axe to grind against Mother Church. While this is usually a bad thing, he steps back and refrains from editorializing, leaving the stories to speak for themselves; the film is refreshingly free of overbearing claptrap one expects to find in anti-religious movies. That said, the horror of what the girls endure is more than enough to put one off one's feed for a week or two. (Those who have attempted to dismiss the film as exaggerated balderdash managed to miss the DVD version, which contains the documentary Sex in a Cold Climate [review below]; it is quite obvious the stories of these three girls are based completely on three of the subjects of the documentary.)Here, however, is the film's main failing; it depicts these horrors without terribly much context. The storyline is full of gaping holes in both plot and temporality; various scenes are set up and executed, then never referenced again, despite being things that would change a person's life. In other words, in short, the movie suffers somewhat from sitcom syndrome; you can do anything you want to your characters, but not terribly much changes. The characters are well drawn, and the actresses play the parts very well, but they're not given terribly much for the characters to do. You can empathize with them, but there's not much for bonding purposes.The end result is more a catalogue of brutality than it is a watchable film. It is, to say the least, a document of deep importance. It needs to be seen, and those responsible need to be punished. The problem is, it's not really all that watchable. ** ?(...)
