I purchased this item despite the other negative reviewer, who seemed to have just received the wrong color.  I ordered a black ink pad and received black.  The ink works great!  We took a footprint and handprint for our baby book (my daughter is 6 weeks old).  I will probably add footprints to personalized items for Christmas.  The ink works fantastic, and the best thing is I wiped it right off my daughter's hand and foot with a diaper wipe!  No mess.  Very easy to use and the memories of her tiny hands and feet will be priceless.
