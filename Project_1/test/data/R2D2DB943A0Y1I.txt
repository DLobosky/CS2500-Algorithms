Im not going to review this particular production, theres over 1700 reviews here already what can I say that has not been said. So I will rather do a comparison between this Firth version and the later version which I will call the knightley version. So allow me pray to copy over what I reveiwed there:I bought both versions at the same time the Firth 1995 and the Knightley version. Which to watch first was my initial dilemma. I decided on the above shorter 2hr. Knightley version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found the Knightley version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previos version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start of my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks. Pleasant viewing.
