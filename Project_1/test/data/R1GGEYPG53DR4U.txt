After awhile I began to see how brilliant the show really was, and how it has great depth to the writing, the characters in particular, and how perfectly the sub-plots are all woven together. The humor is really good, quite clever really, and hidden beneath the light hearted take on vampires and demons lies a very serious and deep tone, which deals with all the complexities of human nature. Love, betrayal, growing up, friendship, sacrifice, the dichotomy of the human condition, it's all in the series, and it gets progressively better throughout all 7 seasons.
 
 The character development is profound, the dialogue has a surprising amount of depth beneath the teenie-bop surface, and the relationships between the Scooby gang are fascinating, and ultimately very touching.
 
 As far as all the mutants, demons and such go, it's similar to the X-Files in that it covers mythology in all sorts of aspects, not just vampires. The X-Files didn't just deal with UFOs even though that was the arching storyline. Same thing with Buffy, the vampire theme was the underlying story that wove it all together, but there are the stand alone episodes and other, non-related monsters that came into being. That's just how the show evolved, and if one sees the series from the beginning, it's very interesting to see how it all ties together and the character growth alone by all the major protagonists is a fascinating study of the human psyche.
 
 Whedon's succes in TV is due to the fact that he writes intelligent and engaging plots with rather deep, personal relationships, and for Buffy to last 7 seasons and Angel 5, that is a testament to his talent, especially considering that the latter was a spin-off, which rarely is succesful.
 
 Whedon's writing style in his TV series is unique, and it is part of that idiosyncracy with his characters and their dialogue that makes it original and stand out on its own. That's the allure that brought so many fans into the series in the first place, among many other factors such as the arching storylines and complex characters.  It was a long and emotional journey from season 1 through 7, and when the audience identifies and sympathizes with the characters on screen, that's a sign of a truly succesful show.  Growing with and learning about the heroes of Buffy is what makes it such an incredibly engaging experience, and the fact that none of the characters are stereotypical or two-dimensional makes it believable within the context.
 
 I simply cannot recommend this series enough, oh and the music on Buffy really helped set the mood, complementing the stories perfectly.
