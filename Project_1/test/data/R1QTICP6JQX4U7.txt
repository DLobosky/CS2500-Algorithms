Napoleon Hill met Andrew Carnegie, and Carnegie challenged him to interview other successful business leaders to find out what had helped them.  Carnegie offered no financial resources, but did help with making  the introductions.  Napoleon Hill was thus launched on the adventure of a  lifetime that led to this book.Napoleon Hill does not lay it all out in  the way that modern writers do.  He wants to leave room for you to discover  what he has learned for yourself.  Some of the key points involve tales  of overwhelming commitment to a goal.  He then talks about the ways that  people have reinforced these goals.  The book deliberately leaves it  unclear how much this goal setting and focus succeeds because of your  concentration and how much because of mental powers of some undefined sort.   That is beside the point, because if you do what Napoleon Hill suggests,  you will have remarkable success in your life. More recent research with  young people shows that those who accomplish the most in their lives are  those who have written goals at a fairly young age, and continue to focus  on those goals.  The point:  Without goals, most people wander around  aimlessly and accomplish less than their full potential.  This does not  mean that you have to work any harder or longer to be successful (although  your commitment may encourage that).  It does mean that your life will be  much more purposeful.  I heartily subscribe to that belief.  Whenever I  have had firm goals, progress has been rapid.  Exceed those goals, and  progress stalls until new goals are set and pursued. Another reason for  reading this book is because you will meet many people in your life who  will have read and used this process to accomplish a great deal in their  own lives.  Your ability to form valuable alliances with these people will  be increased by your understanding of this book.Unlike many positive  thinking books, Think and Grow Rich is based on actual experiences of  people whom many would like to emulate.If nothing else, you will uncover  whether or not you have the dedication it takes to create astonishing  wealth through concentrating your mind on your goals.  If the beach sounds  good to you as you think about it, this methodology is not for you.If  you find that you do not understand Napoleon Hill's message, feel free to  read any of his later books.  He lays out the key points in great detail.  From the title, you may think that this book will give you a very  detailed get-rich process.  It is just the opposite.  You will still have a  lot of work ahead of you to learn how to achieve your goals if you use the  Think and Grow Rich principles, but your work will go better because it  will be purposeful about something that you care passionately about.
