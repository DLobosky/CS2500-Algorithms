Featuring stunning early TMS Entertainment animation; an infectious music score by former Eagle Don Felder (who also performs the memorable theme song); and scripts featuring a great amount of diversity, ranging from character stories to slapstick comedy, Galaxy High (in terms of quality) was far above most Saturday morning offerings. And now thanks to Media Blasters, this classic quality show is finally available on DVD!Galaxy High School - Volume 2 is a single-disc (150 min.) set featuring Full-Frame (1.33:1) video, and 2.0 English audio. Despite the lack of bonus features and lack of remastering (sadly, it shows), this set does feature decent picture and sound, nice menu design, and appropriate chapter stops [as the eps fade to and from commercial breaks]. Galaxy High School - Volume 2 contains episodes 8-13, meaning you complete the entire 13-episode series with this set along with the purchase of Volume 1.Episodes:"Beach Blanket Blow-Up""The Brain Blaster"  "The Brat Pack""Founder's Day""Martian Mumps""It Came From Earth"Highly Recommended!
