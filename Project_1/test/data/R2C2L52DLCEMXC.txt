Butters is one of my favorite "South Park" characters, a very gullible youth whose innocence makes his situations of falling in love, becoming a pimp, being an evil super-villian, and having a robot best friend all the more funny and awesome.The episodes included are "Butters' very own episode" follows Butters alone for the first time as he tries to get his parents together for their anniversary at Bennigan's but some secrets are revealed, "Professor Chaos" where Butters becomes an evil super villian, "The Simpsons already did it" is where Professor Chaos tries to enact evil schemes just to find out each has been done by the Simpsons already, "Raisins" where Butters gets a "girlfriend" who works at a Hooters-like restaurant, "You got F'd in the A" the take-off of "You Got Served" where Butters has to overcome a tragic tap-dancing accident to rejoin the group, "AWESOM-O" where Cartman dresses as a robot pretending to be Butters' best friend to get dirt on him, "Stupid spoiled whore playset" where Paris Hilton adopts Butters calling him Mr. Biggles and dressing him as a bear, "Marjorine" where Butters is forced to dress as a girl and spy on them while the boys fake his death freaking out his parents, "Cartman Sucks" where Butters is declared bi-curious and sent to a Christian conversion camp, "The Ungroundable" where Butters becomes one of the vamp kids and shops at Hot Topic, "The Coon" where Professor Chaos joins forces with The Coon to try and stop new superhero Mysterion, "Butters' bottom bitch" where Butters starts a very successful hugging and kissing business which leads other ladies of the night to join his crew, and "The tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" where the boys wrote the most offensive book ever written that make people puke and convince Butters that he wrote it in his sleep. All very fun and fine examples of Butters being super awesome!This set ALSO comes with the lost chapter of "The Poop that took a pee", a "What would Butters Do?" bracelet, a Pimpin' necklace that says "Butters Bitch", a wearable Inspector Butters Badge, the article of the South Park Tribune about Butters' tap dancing career and tragedy, and a check for 250 Million dollars to Mr. and Mrs. Stotch all in a lovely illustrated box that's simply adorable.
