Recently, my wife and I made the investment of a Nikon 5700.  We are happy with the investment.  We also invested in this book, and we are definately less happy in this one.  I'm going to run down a list of pros and cons and you make the decision.  In the end, I'm glad I bought it.  It taught me some tricks I may never have figured out otherwise, but still I can't believe how much they charge for how little you get.PROS:1. Better than the manual2. Gives examples of the techniques discussed.3. It's the only one that exists.CONS1. WAY too expensive.  This book should cost about five bucks.  It looks like a guy printed it on his computer and took it to the copy shop.2. Some of the examples are too simplistic and assume too many steps.  If a little bit more detail were given, it would have saved me hours of stress and frustration only to realize that he didn't mention a certain setting that had to be changed.  It's your call. If you have the camera and want to learn some more tricks and have a lot of extra money, buy it.  But, if you already have a pretty good feel for the camera and don't have much money left after the investment, I'd suggest waiting for a better book or just learning by goofing around with your camera.
