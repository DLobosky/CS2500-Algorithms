J.W. and Zee Jackson live on Martha's Vineyard with their 2 children.  J.W. is an ex-cop from Boston.  Now he fishes and goes quahogging.  He gets a call from a friend asking him to assist Mahsimba search for 2 ancient soapstone eagles allegedly stolen from African ruins.  Zee is acting distant since she recently shot a man and is having trouble dealing with it.  So J.W. agrees to help Mahsimba.  He starts interviewing all the people on the island who have an interest in African art.  Through the course of his investigation he realizes he has apparently stirred up someone.  He and Mahsimba continue their investigation of the island art world in an attempt to find the soapstone eagles.  J.W. is also trying to find out who killed Matthew Duarte and why.  This series is a fast read.  I highly recommend this book and the complete series.
