&quot;Letters To A Contrarian&quot; is really a book of letter Hitchins writes to himself about, primarily, how to maintain his radical values. It is really a book about who Christopher is. His books are perhaps the most interesting and original books (who else would vilify Mother Theresa and Henry Kissinger?) written on current history and politics; yet the most irrelevant too.  Hitchens is extremely bright (even in an extremely bright profession) , controversial, radical, iconoclastic, educated, experienced, and still astonishingly irrelevant. One time he is taking on Mother Teresa, then appearing as a leftist on C-SPAN against his conservative British brother, then he turns up on Charlie Rose saying he is a libertarian, then he writes regularly for The Nation (while preferring globalization), and finally he applauds an article in the National Review or the Weekly Standard. This latest book is the most scattered of all amounting to little more than a general pep talk about how to keep up your radical credentials (don't follow the crowd, etc.), or, how to be Christopher Hitchens.  Being so independent, cool, intellectual, and affected (unshaven, trench coat, chain smoking, intellectual verbal cadence) may be good for ones' image and career but how does it really help the reader who time and again is given only the choice of voting for a Democrat or Republican?  In the beginning there was Thomas Jefferson arguing for freedom and Alexander Hamilton arguing for Government. Today the Democrats and Republicans are still arguing about the same issue, while Mr. Hitchens is oddly arguing about something else not even defined, let alone on the ballot? Why doesn't he write a book on why Trent Lott and Sam Daschel have split the United States gov't along stupid or irrelevant lines? Why doesn't he address the issue every American faces every time he enters a voting booth? In truth, the more relevant and central an issue is to World History the more Mr. Hitchens stays away from it. So, if you want to be a proud but harmless radical, read this book. But, please consider that when you are done, like Marlon Brando in &quot;The Wild Ones&quot; you'll still have to figure out what it is that you want to be radical about, if that should matter to you at all. The scattershot Hitchins/Brando approach is just not relevant to the choice voters face. The non-intellectual mass media keeps America divided and in the middle because that is how the they make the most money and find the biggest audience while the very intellectual Christopher Hitchens does the same thing because that is how he too makes the most money. Or, perhaps in an existential world &quot;cool and independent&quot; has a value all by itself? But, if you want to read a book that seeks to be relevant as much as this book seeks to avoid relevancy try &quot;Understanding The Difference Between Democrats And Republicans&quot;
