Rifkin does an excellent job as the narrator of this book. his vocal tone and reading style match the story very well.  the story itself has various logical problems that i found distracting. i cannot add much to what has already be written by over 3000 reviews.  The story has a very interesting if not new theme of a dystopic planned society and the ending is deliberately open. Unfortunately, the story has logical problems that prove distracting to a reader thinking about the subjects raised, and therefore make you aware you are reading a constructed narrative.i would suggest looking at the Dr van der Linden's review (he rates the book 1 star)  as well as the 5 star reviews, as he makes some valid points about the story and suggests other better constructed stories on the similar dystopic  themes The Forgotten Door (Apple Paperbacks), Between Planets, Citizen of the Galaxy.
