I've tried several different types of headphones; the earbuds, the sound canceling kind, the behind the head kind, and cheap regular headphones, to varying degrees of success. So far, these are some of the most comfortable headphones I've tried. The headphones are very light and it is easy to forget that you are wearing them and the padding on the phones themselves feel nice on the ears. They also add some noise canceling (I put them on and there was a slight, but noticeable, reduction of outside noise). I am not to knowledgeable about sound qualities, but I listened to a wide range of music genres and didn't notice any sound problems. In fact it sounded quite good. I've worn them twice for 2-3 hours each time, which is probably the longest I have ever been able to wear headphones. The other review mentioned sound leakage as a problem. I tested this (since I need these headphones for work where I share an office) and only got leakage when the volume was cranked up to almost the highest setting on my iPhone. So, not really a problem. All in all, I really like these headphones and plan to buy another set in a different color to keep at home.
