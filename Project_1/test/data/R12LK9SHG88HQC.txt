I have started reading military histories again and looking through a box of my own oldies, there was STRANGE AND FASCINATING FACTS by Burke Davis.   I must say along with several other books by him. Mr. Davis is an outstanding writer with so many great works of the Civil War.  This book is perfect for teacher that wants to add interesting spice to their lectures.  My high school students loved trivia like this mixed into the academia.  RECOMMENDED
