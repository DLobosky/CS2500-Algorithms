I bought these for my husband. They actually work. My husband was so quiet during the night, I had to poke him numerous times to see if he was still breathing because I didn't hear snoring. If you take a minute to try all the sizes out, you will find the perfect fit and the Nasivent will not fall out during the night. These work so well I wish they sold them in four packs of each size. Will definitely be buying again.
