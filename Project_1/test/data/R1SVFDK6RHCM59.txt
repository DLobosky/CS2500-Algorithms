I'm an intermediate bellydancer and was able to do most of the workouts until she does some combinations towards the end that just got too confusing and she didn't really explain what she was doing.  Other than that, she works on the hip isolations which really refine doing the maia (figure 8).  This video is challenging yet do-able.  The dvd comes with special features which includes a bonus mini workout, a solo performance, a performance by her entire troupe and circle dance.  Her students in the video are very talented and the workout motivates you to get to their level.  Oh, and strangely there is a random part where she talks about her pregnancy.
 I recommend her pilates or yoga dvd over this one.
