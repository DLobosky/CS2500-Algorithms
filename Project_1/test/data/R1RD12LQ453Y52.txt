These headphones  sound perfect right out of the box,they are only going to sound better when they are burned in. The bass is just right for me.  I like to have strong bass,but not have it drown out small weaker sounds.  There are sounds in songs I have been listening to my whole life,that I am hearing for the first time,and other sounds are easier to hear. The vocals rich and full.  These headphones are very comfortable and light on my head.  The three wing design works very well,they automaticly adjusted to the shape of my head.  I can tell you this these headphones are made for bigger heads,if you have a small head they may not fit you as well as they fit me,I have fairly large head.  I really like the cord,it is 10 feet long,it is thick and sturdy.  Before I bought these headphones,I bought the Bose® QuietComfort® 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones for $320 with taxes.  The Bose headphones burned out in a little over a week of heavy use.  The Bose did not sound half as good as Audio-Technica ATH-A900 Headphones.  The Bose noise cancelling was great,but I like great sound better. I have looked a 12 headphones or more that are in the $200-$350 range,and these are the best reviewed.  If you buy the Audio-Technica ATH-A900 Headphonheades,you will not be sorry.     Update 12-10-2010    I bought a new pair of headphones that look and sound better for $199 V-MODA XFLPR-ROUGE Crossfade LP Over-the-Ear Headphones (Rouge).  These new headphones come with a carrying case and two detachable cords.
