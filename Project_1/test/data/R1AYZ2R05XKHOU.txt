Seemed agreeable for two days, then on the third day the combination gave me several hours of rotten-egg flatulence like I have never experienced in my life.  I also tried the Nutiva plain shelled hemp seeds right out of a vaccuum bag... put a heaping teaspoon of this product on my usual cereal (Nature's Path Heritage) and skim milk -- got really bad diarrhea for the next two days.  Again, I had skim milk and hemp together in combination.   Too early to say it's the hemp, might be the combination -- maybe hemp creates a digestive environment where the milk is indigestible. Usually I can eat just about anything so I was very surprised.  I'll give it another try someday...If anyone has any insight, please feel free to comment.
