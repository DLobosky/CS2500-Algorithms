Stranger still, Idon't remember ANY of them clashing with each other during the day!  In Los Angeles, one could flip from chs. 2 (KNXT - now KCBS/Columbia)to4 (KNBC/National) to 7 (KABC/American) and catch about all of theircartoons.  (I seem to remember Birdman airing on Ch. 4 at the time)Birdman - It was never said, but he worked with 'our' US Government inbattles with the bad guys.  As Communism was big in the 60's, the over-tones were crystal clear.The Galaxy Trio - Interplanetary Police who did battle with all kindsof criminals.This show wasn't my favorite Hanna-Barbera Animated show (that honor isreserved for The Herculoids (which aired on CBS) and Mighty Mightor(which also aired on NBC), but I enjoyed it enough back then to wantto buy it now ($20/US)!  It still garners a Five-Star rating!
