Plug and play use with win7, proprietary software installation optional for extended features.  Solid quality and sleek look.  10key numeric pad a must.  Wireless connectivity rock-solid steady with no lag (in comparison, thus far, I've found bluetooth to be universal crap that can't reliably hold a connection).  Key action is responsive and quiet.  Haven't encountered key blocking thingee yet mentioned by other reviewers - maybe i don't type fast enough - probably around 70wpm at my best.  Comes with music media controls (using fn keys) on keyboard including dedicated volume/mute buttons which I frequently use.  Also really like the dedicated calculator and eject button.  Sturdy, comfortable built-in wrist rest is a must.  Wireless keyboard with actual LED on caps lock key to indicate on!  Unusually, doesn't appear to have numlock (which i love --- usually keep accidentally hitting that one and i never use the keypad for anything but number functionality). Small key size does work for insert key - I prefer it to be small or far away since almost never use overwrite functionality (again, often accidentally hit key when doing sloppy delete). Last but not least (near top priority actually): delete/home/end/pageup/pagedown (i'll call it dhepp) layout with 3keys across x 2down (w/oversize del) - perfect!!! Cons: Keyboard slopes upward due to built in battery roll area and I believe ergonomics should be straight slope. Keys are just like laptop keys which i dislike - for me, the absolute best was the S510 logitech keyboard with keys that have low/mid rise height --- while S510 has unbeatable key action it also, unfortunately, has the rotten 2 across dhepp/insert layout and had to go. I keep looking for something with the S510 key feel and can't find it.  Want full size escape and pf keys since i use them a lot.  Also this is missing a dedicated right-click button which I also use frequently (forced me to discover the fkey shortcut to compensate --- you learn something new everyday.)  The main reason I would never buy again or recommend is the compactness of the keyboard (which I believe is its selling point) -- with no space between the tiny top row keys and the rest of the keys, I keep accidentally hitting them --- especially the eject button when I hit backspace etc.  Well, now I know --- no more compact keyboards for me.Had this around 6 months and no complaints about battery life --- there is an off switch if preferred (i am too lazy to use it).
