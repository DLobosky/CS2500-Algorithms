No matter how many times I see it, it will always make me laugh and cry. Everything looked like it was real. The music was touching, even the movie. If there is anyone who says it was dumb, they'll be getting a big black eye. Teenagers can enjoy it too, no matter how old they are. I bet it could win an oscar for anything it is nominated. Everyone loved it and it was the #1 movie of 2002 spring. This movie is a heartwarming film and I will never get tired of it. I even do know that a lot of people will never get tired of it too. I love this movie!!!
