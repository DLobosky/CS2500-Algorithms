This is one of the strangest looking films I can remember. The sets make  this film look like a biblical soap opera gone futuristic. I am not sure if  this was director Victor Saville's intent or not. Filmed in CinemaScope by  William V. Skall, it just looks so offbeat. In fact, Skall was nominated  for an Academy Award for his Color Cinematography.Based on the novel by  Thomas Costain, it deals with the trials and tribulations of a Greek  craftsman, portrayed by Paul Newman, who designed the cup used at the Last  Supper.The cast includes voluptuous Virginia Mayo, Jack Palance, Pier  Angeli, Joseph Wiseman, Natalie Wood, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene and  Alexander Scourby. Faring best is Jack Palance giving a cryptic performance  as a master of illusions.  Franz Waxman's Academy Award nominated score  is excellent, outdoing the script and most of the performances. This was  director Victor Saville's second to last film. It is a curious and  interesting film, which certainly follows a different path.
