The series features the likable Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) and is set in the fictional English county of Midsomer which consists of several villages each of which seems to rival Cabot Cove, Maine for their improbably high murder rates. Graham had a penchant for "interesting" characters and over the years, the show's writers have stayed true to the author's taste. Often quirky, sometimes downright odd, the characters and their many idiosyncrasies are central to each episode. Along with the uniformly first-rate acting, the quality writing and the intricate plots, they have helped to keep the show dependably entertaining. It is the only television show on my auto-buy list.With elements of the traditional whodunit, non-graphic police procedural and old-fashioned British cozy, Midsomer Murders should appeal to a variety of murder mystery fans. Barnaby is an approachable type and episodes nicely mix his work and home lives. His wife Joyce and daughter Cully appear often and occasionally find themselves involved in his investigations. The series has very little overall story arc and episodes exist more or less independent of one another. IMHO, they need not be viewed in broadcast order. Barnaby's Detective Sergeants do change a number of times over the run of the series, though, so viewers who might be annoyed by viewing episodes out of order for that reason should start at the beginning. (Oddly, with this series, it's actually Box Set #5 that contains the first aired episodes. After that, proceed with Box Sets #1, #2, #3, #4, #6 etc.)My only gripe with Set 18 is that it includes only three episodes, rather than the more usual four. They complete the 12th Season of the show and are as follows: * Small Mercies (Episode 71): In a model village located in Little Worthy, a man's body is found tied to the ground a la Gulliver in the land of Lilliput.* The Creeper (Episode 72): Has "The Creeper", a cat burglar selectively stealing from homes in the Midsomer villages moved on to murder? * The Great & the Good (Episode 73): Schoolteacher Connie Bishop fears she is killing the men of Badger's Drift while sleep-walking. Because of the somewhat unorthodox behavior of a number of the characters, some rare flashes of nudity and the often gruesome nature of the crimes, I feel Midsomer Murders is best suited to older teens and adults. Highly recommended.Notes:* All three episodes included in Set 18 have SDH subtitles.* If you're thinking of waiting for the Blu-ray version, please note that as of today, nearly four months after the DVD release of Set 17, the Blu-ray version of that set is not yet available for order. If you're not in any hurry...  :-)* After The Great & the Good, only 8 episodes remain for release here in the United States starring John Nettles as Tom Barnaby. Barnaby then retires from the force (and Nettles from the series) and his cousin John Barnaby, portrayed by Neil Dudgeon, takes over his post.
