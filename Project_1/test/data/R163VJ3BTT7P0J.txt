This ring was in excellent condition but it was just ridiculously big. The photo looks like a ring that could make a statement but not one that would be an anchor! It wasn't heavy, just cheap looking. You half expect to see mold lines up the sides of it. The prongs were also huge and unshapely. It's a shame because it could have been really lovely had the maker simply reduced the size and taken a little more time with the details. I am hesitant to buy from this vendor again.
