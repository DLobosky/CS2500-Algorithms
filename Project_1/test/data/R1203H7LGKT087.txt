Series two of Downton Abbey is as good as the first. It picks up in Nov of 1916 where series one ended. The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment. You will be as enthralled as the true series of comparison, the amazing dramatization of Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition). Both are period perfection, a look at British life in the war years, some intense suspense and mystery mixed with bits of serenity and romance. It's the WWI years with all the good and the bad, but the acting and writing make it all seem good somehow, at least from an entertainment point of view.Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, or Violet to her family and friends, is a show within a show. She is perfection. Watch her face, enjoy her lines and relish the delivery. "Snobbery in splendor." Stellar isn't an adequate superlative.Episode 1: NOVEMBER 1916;WWII fighting on the front depicted as well as any series. It's brutal, muddy, and full of death. Matthew leads his men while at Downton Abbey the family & help struggles to find their own personal place of service to the war effort.2: APRIL 1917;Many changes at Downton Abbey as some leave to the war needs, the war itself, or to associated war work. Others arrive affected by war trials.3: JULY 1917;Downton is converted to a officers' convalescent hospital with Thomas, Acting Sgt. Barrow, managing. Oh my! Julian Wadham (War Horse, English Patient) guest stars as a visiting General.4: 1918;Troubles aplenty for many related to war; love; responsibilities; MIAs; and who's in command.5: AUGUST 1918;Local soldiers are wounded; secrets of Downton Abbey renew conflict; and major decisions must be made by many of the house.6: NOVEMBER 1918;the dead returns to Downton; wounded recoups; there are multiple talks of marriage; and Downton Abbey's future is in the balance even as war comes to it's end.7: 1919;Post war changes includes romance; wedding talk; much joy; and new beginnings; even as others suffer from action of the past.8: APRIL 1919;Good and bad marriage plans of some take a toll on the overall post-war times. Illness strikes Downton Abbey as uppers and lowers mingle, and I do mean mingle.9: CHRISTMAS 1919-NEW YEARS 1920;A visual holiday delight seeing the decor and costuming of the period at holiday time, as well as the foods, the gaiety, and gift giving. But there is yet the ongoing story lines of the saga taking place in the family at and connected to Downton Abbey.I'd strongly recommend the full series, even the past series one, and of course I'll be purchasing Series Three as soon as it is available.
