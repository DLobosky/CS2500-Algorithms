Let me first say that I'm not super picky about sound quality - never have been. But I ordered these to replace a ruined pair of headphones, and I love them. At least to me the music sounds great, better than any other headphones I've used. And the outside noise cancellation is also better than other headphones, though I'm sure it's not as good as headphones made specifically for noise cancellation. I'm listening to my iPod with these headphones now on a pretty low volume and I can't hear myself typing.On another note, I have small ears. I always had trouble finding in-ear headphones that were comfortable - they always hurt and felt like they were pushing against my ear. I had my last pair of headphones for years because they were the most comfortable I could find, though they still got uncomfortable after about 45 minutes of wearing them. Have not had that problem with these at all and I've worn them for about an hour at the longest so far. They come with three sizes of little in-ear cups (I'm sure there's a better name for them but I don't know it) and I use the smallest, and love them.Overall just very satisfied with these, especially at this price! I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but I'm also sure they cost way more.
