The main thesis is that plants quietly manipulate animals, including insects, as much or more than the other way around, which is the commonest view.  There are several main sections to carry the story, and and an epilogue.  Pollan's writing is exquisite, nearly poetry in prose with very few incomprehensible lines; the nirvana of his writing is 5-star.	Apples:  Pollan found that there really was a Johnny Appleseed.  I had not known that apples were drunk as cider, hard cider or applejack until better cloned varieties appeared in the late 19th century, which being much sweeter, could be eaten.  The wild Asian origins of the inedible apple were compared unfavorably with the reduction in biodiversity that yielded our 10 or so favorite varieties.	Tulips:  Pollan's parentally enforced tulip plantings were confessed.  The origin of the domesticated tulip in the Ottoman Empire and the wild speculation in 17th century Holland were brought out.  Pollan believes that flowering plants that produced sugars and proteins (p109) made mammals possible.	Marihuana:  Pollan's own experimentation was justified by results - heightened awareness with no bad side-effects.  The US government's war on marihuana was described with the implication that it had no technical basis.  Why were the obvious motives of tobacco, alcohol and drug companies not aired?  The cultivation of marihuana clones hydroponically on a huge scale was described.  The obstruction to the medical uses of marihuana was deplored, and, in my opinion, this is highly justified.	Potato:  The failure of the Irish potato crops in the 1840s due to lack of biodiversity was described.  GM potato with Bt gene (Monsanto's NewLeaf) was compared as an undesirable monoculture, opposite to organic farming of a number of varieties.  The advantages of biological (still chemical, remember) control of pests over chemical control was properly described.  The inherently higher costs of organicly grown potato were acknowledged.  But Pollan ate NewLeaf potato on a farm in Idaho, more of them as French fries from McDonald's, and then refused to eat his own or serve them at a picnic!  All this fuss over possible dangers of eating Bt, yet not a word about the absolutely known dangers of trans fat in those fries!  (Search PubMed &lt;[website edited]> for Riserus U and Oomen CM and de Roos NM and Lemaitre RN)	Like too many non-chemists, Pollan made some blunders: "...since sugar is the form in which nature stores food energy."  (p19) Other than in sugar cane and beets, the primary storage in plants is as starch and cellulose. In animals it is glycogen and fat. (John de Man, Food Chemistry, 3rd ed., Aspen, Gaithersburg, MD, 1999.)	Here and there global warming by humans is noted as a given, when of course nothing of the sort has been proven, or even accepted by a majority of scientists and engineers (S. Fred Singer, Hot Talk, Cold Science, The Independent Institute, Oakland, CA; Bjørn Lomborg, The Skeptical Environmentalist, Cambridge University Press, 2001; and now C. Essex and R. McKitrick, Taken by Storm, Key Porter, Toronto, 2002, available from Amazon Canada).  	One of the most egregious eco-lies of all time is repeated as gospel (p211): that DDT caused thinning of bird eggshells, and loss of bird populations.  This nonsense is exposed in S. Fred Singer, Science does not justify Ban on DDT, Environment & Climate News, 2003;6(3):2; Adam J. Lieberman, Facts vs. Frears: A Review of the 20 Greatest Unfounded Health Scares of Recent Times, American Council on Science and Health, 1997. &lt;[website edited]>	In the end Pollan's main thesis is not supported.  Plants do what they do, and the presence of animals and insects will favor some of their activities.  Pollan's view is extremely humanistic with a technophobic slant, some of which may turn out to be justified, but it is anything but "a plant's-eye view of the world".	Because of this and the common humanistic blunders indicating superficial research, only 2 stars can be given.
