ANY TIME YOU CAN PICK UP TWO MARTIN DENNY ALBUMS ON ONE CD, YOU SHOULD DO IT.  THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THESE TWO-FER DOUBLE ALBUM CD'S RELEASED, AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD.  IF YOU LIKE EXOTICA MUSIC, THAN YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. ALL OF THE MARTIN DENNY RELEASES FROM THE 1950'S ARE GREAT, THEY BLEND A LOT OF PERCUSSION, CHANTING, BIRD AND JUNGLE ANIMAL SOUNDS, CHIMES, PIANO, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS INTO A  LOT OF REALLY OVER-THE-TOP LOUNGE MUSIC.
