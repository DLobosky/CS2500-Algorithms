Even though Rory Block's full understanding and command of religious music -gospel- is very well documented in her several recordings, her relation to the music of Rev. Gary Davis has been a little less evident to some of us. As she explains in the liner notes of her new CD: "My area of focus was the Delta styles from day one. I never considered myself an expert in Davis's style."Well, let me tell you that an expert she is, and a wonderful performer! Her singing and her guitar playing are infused with a sensibility and a fervor that never interfere with her musicianship. Long time fans of Rory Block will discover new variations in her singing -but the same passion- and, as a curious note, the use of finger picks which gives her guitar a new sound.
