What &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; accomplished at an emotional level, &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; accomplishes in its message and plot. No it isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it certainly isn't the horribly bad movie that I imagined after reading the reviews on this site. It is a sly take on capital punishment, as you probably know already. It will hold your interest right through to its twisted end, which is pretty much what entertainment is to me. Having said that, I did find the characters a little cliched -- (1) the alcoholic and dissolute but &quot;genius&quot; professor(2) the emotional, crusading activist(3) the plucky, assertive reporter(4) the good-old-boy country lawyer(5) the well-groomed but brainless governor(6) the oh-so-quiet texan mystery manThe movie has its moments, and although the &quot;big explosive ending&quot; was not exactly opaque to me, it did make me think for a couple of days after the movie. That cannot be bad. Definitely worth a watch!
