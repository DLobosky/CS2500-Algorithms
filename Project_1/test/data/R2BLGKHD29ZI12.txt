Don't mess with my favorite diapers, Pampers! But fortunately, these Easy Ups haven't changed a bit... they just have new, confusing size names.I called Pampers Customer Service to get the low-down, and they told me that that Size 4 is now called 2T/3T, Size 5 is 3T/4T, and Size 6 is 4T/5T. My daughter wears Size 5, so I ordered the 3T/4T, and sure enough, they're exactly the same as before. That makes both of us happy.
