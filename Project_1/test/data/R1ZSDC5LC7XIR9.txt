Cabinets are off-limits to her.  It is kind of hard to open and close, but the installation hands down beats any drilling-type devices.  Another major advantage - we can choose to leave a cabinet locked or unlocked, e.g., if we're putting away clean dishes or doing house work while baby is sleeping, we can leave them unlocked instead of fiddling with a lock every time.Why did I give it only 4*?  We were so impressed, I went to Amazon and ordered another one.  The original ones had white buttons.  They sent me a package with black one.  There is no way on their website to choose a color.  It is not even indicated those come in different colors.  So I either have to return, or live with mixed colors.  Not cool!
