This is a great wireless mouse. I bought it because of the micro receiver which plugs into my computer's USB port. It is very small and doesn't stick out much at all making it almost invisible. The other thing I like about this optical mouse is that it has an on-off switch on the bottom so you can turn it off when not in use and save your battery. There is also a little storage area underneath to store your micro usb receiver for travel purposes. It works great with my desktop. I liked it so much I bought 2 more (models M305) which are a little smaller but have the same micro USB rece3iver. I am using these additional  mice on my two laptops in the house. Because the receivers are so small, I can just leave them plugged into a USB port in either laptop so they are always ready to go. The M305 also has a storage area for the micro receiver and an on-off switch for the mouse. I love these mice and am thinking of buying more for Xmas presents this year.
