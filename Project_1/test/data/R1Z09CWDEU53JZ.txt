In the Grado SR-80 price range I only have four other headphones: Technics DJ Headphones, Sony V700 DJ, Sony Pro 7506, and Sennheiser Pro HD 280.  Of these only the Sony's would even be in the same league.  The Grado are flat in response, neutral in sound, and the imaging is the best I've heard since the Sony's.  The are also open air and lighter in weight and feel better on your head.  They aren't as sensitive, but all you have to do is turn up the amp.  They won't distort.Now for the Disclaimer: They have only a large jack.  They have separate cords coming from each headphone rather than one single one from either the left or the right.  The cord is short and uncoiled.  The actually plastic that the headphones are made of look cheaply built.  Most headphones are made of plastic it just looks like these are much cheaper than others.Otherwise I recommend these headphones highly.
