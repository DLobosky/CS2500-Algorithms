The stories were all good and again, the book is told from a very Christian point of view. Many of the stories made me cry, many were comforting in the long run, but I really thought the first book was just a little better. I think there was more of the miraculous that showed God's never ending grace and love for His children in the first one. However, I am not sorry that I bought this volume. As I said in my first book review, if you are looking for details of clinical death and dying and what happens to the body as well as the mind, your are barking up the wrong tree.This book is not about process of dying and duties of a hospice nurse but the spiritual journey of the dying and their families from a Christian perspective. I think the dying experience affects the nurse just as much as the patient and family and Trudy Harris makes that aspect crystal clear. Being a nurse myself, I have been with the dying and it is a humbling experience. Depending on the circumstances, it is emotional, it is sad, sometimes frightening because of the anger that some families express but it can also be joyful. I think Ms. Harris does a very good job of portraying the joy and peace that can be had by all involved in her narrative. I liked this book well enough that if there is ever another, I'll be first in line to purchase it.
