Except for the three small buttons on the bottom row, the backlit buttons are large and easy to see and easy to push. Sound quality is not stellar, but is more than adequate.Two gripes are the dimly lit display that in no way measures up to the brightly lit screen shown on the packaging. Also dialing is slower than other phones I've used, but that's a minor complaint. In retrospect I wish I'd spent a little more for a phone with a speakerphone feature. This isn't a bad phone for a second, third or fourth option. It's a good phone for that spare bedroom, but not the best choice for one's primary phone.
