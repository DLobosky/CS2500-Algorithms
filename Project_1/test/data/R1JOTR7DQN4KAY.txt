Initially I thought this mouse was too small and I had doubts about bluetooth in general. However it is very comfortable in my hand and bluetooth works reliably. It does go to sleep when not used, but wakes up very quickly. The wheel button makes a clicking noise when rotated, which I don't care for, but I'm sure I could get used to it. However, if I rotate upward, it clicks much louder. I find that irritating. And I find that I frequently end up depressing the wheel button (and activating autoscrolling) when I was just trying to rotate. But the deal breaker is the back button. The back button is hard to press, doesn't always make a clicking noise, and doesn't always work. And sometimes it makes a groaning noise.  I don't know if I got a bad one or if they are all like this. But mine is going back.EDIT----I exchanged it for a Logitech V470 and immediately noticed two things.First, the Logitech mouse doesn't slide as smoothly across my desk as the Microsoft mouse. I don't use a mouse pad. The Microsoft mouse slid smoothly and felt great. The Logitech mouse felt like dragging your finger nails across a chalk board. The more I used it, the more I dreaded the feeling.Second, there was a noticeable delay between when I moved the mouse and when the pointer moved on the screen. This was MOST irritating. I realize that Logitech specifies Broadcom/Widcomm hardware and stack, but Microsoft has no such restriction. I have ISSC hardware and Blue Soleil stack. I have what I have and there is no delay with the Microsoft mouse.Other than that, I thought the Logitech mouse was better. I preferred the larger size, the AA batteries, the tilt wheel, the quiet turning wheel, and the shiny blue housing. I think the battery cover design is more rugged. The buttons definitely have a louder click, but I have no preference either way.I decided to choose bad over worse, sent the Logitech back and now have two Microsoft 5000's. My original one definitely had a defective back button. These two work fine. However, one has a wheel that clicks very loudly when turned (just like my original one), but the other one does not.  The quiet one has an August 2009 build date while the noisy one has a May 2009 build date. I guess Microsoft made some improvements. I think I can live with them until something better comes along.
