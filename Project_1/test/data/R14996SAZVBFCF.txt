A lot of students may play at the same time. In the game there are different types of colored cards you use to play. The colors are blue, green, and yellow. You also need three plastic chips for each player. The plastic chips can be any color and any shape. You only need the plastic chips if you don't have a move. The chips do not come with the game, so my teacher lets us borrow some from another game. Here is how you play: Take two yellow cards, one green card and one blue card. Everyone who's playing takes three plastic chips you can use paper if you don't have plastic chips. The goal of the game is to be able to use the numbers on the 4 cards to come up with the number you have to 'play' on your turn. The game always starts with the number 1 and then the next player has to come up with the number 2, and so on, until someone gets stuck. The players use the cards and +/-/x/ and division to make a number sentence that equals the number they have to 'play'. For example, if the cards were 2, 1, 5, and 9  and I had to play the number 7.... I could say 9-2=7 OR 5+2=7 OR 9-5+2+1=7 and so on. Insomnia is one of my favorite games I've ever played. I hope it becomes one of your favorite games!When you don't have a move you put a plastic or paper chip in the middle then the round is over. You keep your chip in the middle till the game is done. The most important rule is to have a great time.   If you like challenging games I have a feeling you will like it to. The game sometimes is easy other times it's pretty challenging. I enjoy playing Albert's Insomnia and if you buy it I think you will like it to. You can always have a fun time playing it. One time I was   really tired and bored, then I was told to play to play  Albert's Insomnia. I didn't know if it was going to be fun or boring. It turned out to be great. I hope you enjoy it if buy it. Thank you for reading my review!
