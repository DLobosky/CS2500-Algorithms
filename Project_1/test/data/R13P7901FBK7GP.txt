In the last scene of "Batman Begins" Batman flips over a card and it turnes out 2 B the Joker Card. When I left the theatre I thirsted for a sequal & when I found out that there was going 2 B 1 I kept going on the Internet 2 C who they cast as The Joker. It turned out Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker. As many Batman fans were back then I questioned whether or not Heath could play The Joker. It wasn't until I saw the 1st trailer that I started bouncing off the walls and began counting down the days until the film's release.  Then Heath died, I as many fans out there mourned his death and wondered if he had completely finished filming The Dark Knight. WBs put everyone's fears 2 rest & assured everyone that the film was finished filming & was set 2 B released as scheduled.  After I saw Iron-Man I wondered how could TDK top this movie. I found out the day of its release. 1st off The film leaves you @ each & every moment on the edge of your seat (I swear I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair). Christian Bale still proved that he was indeed the greatest Batman of all time. Aaron Eckhart gave a gr8 performance as Harvey Dent & even gave a chilling performance as Two-Face (that made Tommy Lee Jone's performance in "Batman Forever" look really bad). Gary Oldman continued 2 WOW me as lieutenant Gordon(who later becomes Commisioner). Maggie Gyllenhal made Katie Holmes look really bad as she took on the role of Rachel Dawes (That Holmes played in "Batman Begins").  But, I think that the performance that really overwhelmed all of these gr8 actors was Heath's Portrayal of The Joker. Now I must admit I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in the 1989 movie "Batman." However, after seeing this movie Heath made Jack Nicholson's Joker look like 1 of those clowns that entertains @ children's B-day parties. Heath's Joker was Dark & extremely disturbed and loved causing mayhem in Gotham by blowing up hospitals in a nurse's outfit (LOL), poisoning the police commissioner with sulfuric acid, making a "Pencil Disappear," & blowing up the Major crimes unit building w/ a bomb implanted inside another prisoner. Heath's Joker looked more like he's represented in the comics 2day. He has no backstory (however, U find out bits & pieces of his backstory in some of his scenes), he's deadly, & even more insane than ever before. His look was extremely different also he had a carved smile on his face & long greasy green hair, & his make-up looked like it had been applied & didn't look like he had fallen into a vat of chemicals. Oh, and I almost 4got 2 mention this but this Joker gets the last laugh.  The movie is centered around 3 men: Batman/Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon, & Harvey Dent. Joker sets his sight out on all 3 men but mostly on Harvey Dent & in a way "turns" Harvey in2 Two-Face & leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween all 3 men.  This movie makes Batman face the ? if whether or not he is really doing any good in Gotham or if he is the cause of all the mayhem that is happening in Gotham City.  2 months after the movie's release it has made over $500 million dollars making it the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time(beating all Star Wars films WOW)but still comming short 2 Titanic. Now talks of a 3rd Batman movie R comming up but 2 me it really doesen't matter if they come out w/ a 3rd movie or not. "The Dark Knight" left you w/ a conclusion and unlike "Batman Begins" didn't leave U wanting a sequal.  Now I know I probably wasted a whole page writing about my favorite movie of all time but all I have 2 say about it now is that if U didn't get 2 C this movie in theatres see it now buy the DVD, sit back & B prepared 2 B WOWED. The movie is about 3hrs. long but believe me there's so much going on it doesen't even feel like its 3hrs. So Sign-up 2 be notified when this movie is going 2 be released or pre-order the movie right now WHAT R U WAITING 4?
