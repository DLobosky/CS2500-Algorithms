I've been impressed with the Manfrotto brand over the years, and this adapter's build quality did not disappoint. I have used it on a number of photo shoots so far, and it serves its purpose well.The one con that I might mention is that it comes with a completely useless user guide. I had to assemble it on to my stand using commonsense as well as trial and error.Note that I use this adapter in conjunction with a Westcott 43" Optical White Satin Collapsible Umbrella, Manfrotto 5001B 74-Inch Nano Stand, and a Stroboframe Bracket Shoe Mount. This combination works exceedingly well for my purposes.Happy Strobing!~Damodar
