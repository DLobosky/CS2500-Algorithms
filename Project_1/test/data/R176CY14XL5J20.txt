Well written, easy to understand and many opportunities to practice what it's talking about.  The CD is invaluable.  It has all the songs recorded which are in the book.  A favorite piece I usually ask all of my beginning students to learn is the, "Malaguena".  It's really great that they can hear the actual piece being played by the author of the book EXACTLY as it is written in musical notation in the book.  It is absolutely LOADED with pertinent guitar information.  It's more than a beginner's book, but starts off very logically and doesn't rush into more information too soon.  Great pictures, diagrams, hints and musical discussions.  I can't say enough good things about this book.If you want to try learning Classical guitar on your own without a teacher, this is about the only book I've found that will help you do it.  I've had one student hire me for lessons after he started this book on his own, and I was impressed at how well he understood the information and his technique was not bad at all!
