M. Night Shyamalan's supernatural thriller is one of most chilling and unpredictable films i've seen for a long time. Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances, especially Osment, who has the gift of seeing dead people. Shyamalan's taut direction makes this one an amazing and thrilling film with that now-famous shocker ending (Even though you probably know what happens). The stunning cinematography and some terrific scenes with Osment talking to Willis about his &quot;gift&quot; are fantastic. Add a creepy musical score, some inventive camerawork and a sharp script and you have one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.The DVD extras are good, with a &quot;Making-Of&quot; Documentary, deleted Scenes and Extended Ending, storyboard to Film Comparisons, an interview with director M. Night Shyamalan, music and sound design, the doco &quot;Reaching the Audience &amp; Rules and Clues&quot;, trailers and TV spots. The only thing lacking is a commentary from Shyamalan, but the rest of the extras makes up for it. Overall, a great DVD.
