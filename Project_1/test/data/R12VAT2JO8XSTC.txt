The prose in itself is beautifully written in a manner that few books of any sort are today.  If this lovely style is &quot;long-winded,&quot; as one reviewer dubbed it, then today's literary culture would do well to open the door and let some air in, regardless of the season!  The book that comes closest, oddly, to the style of Hall's masterpiece is the contemporary &quot;straight&quot; Bildungsroman of Thomas Wolfe-Look Homeward, Angel.  Hall is more effective, though, in bringing home &quot;the pain of all beauty,&quot; and I found myself having to put the bok down several times to clear the salty blur from my eyes, such is its poignancy.  Oddly again, the storyline of Hall's book and the plight of Stephen Gordon remind me of nothing so much as Rousseau in his Confessions.-Then again, none of this should really be surprising.  All three were sensitiive geniuses who suffered through much of their lives.  This book will strike a chord of love in you, if you, like Hall and her protagonist, have ever felt &quot;...like a soul that wakes up to find itself wandering, unwanted, between the spheres.&quot;
