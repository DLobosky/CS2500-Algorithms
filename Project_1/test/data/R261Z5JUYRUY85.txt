Did Walt Disney ever do anything but write up clues and place them all over the place?  You have to wonder when he had time to even come up with Disney World when he was so busy hiding clues, and keeping them safe.  However, this is the story of what if he did it again.  This time Lance needs to team up with a mysterious security guard, and the daughter of one of the keepers of hidden mickeys.  The clues this time mostly kept them in the park, and I liked the fact they were in there.  I could relate more to the action, and I thought the adventure this time was more fun.  When I reviewed the first book I ripped on the authors for not having an antagonist to drive the action.  I think the authors heard the anger from the people who read the book and added one into this one.  The problem is the guy is written very badly.  He comes off like a cartoon bad guy, with not one bit of realistic tendency at all.  I'm surprised the writers didn't have him clubbing baby seals while screaming "I AM EVIL!"  Was he a threat during the story.  Sure, but you never take him seriously, worse yet he is in the 3rd book as well and it's just as stupid.  The author eventually learns how to write an antagonist in the 4th book, but it's a character already established so it's hard for her to screw it up.This story had less chapters I would have cut or trimmed which was good.  That being said the whole Vegas trip could have been shorten to 3-4 pages...and I think we would have got reaction from it.I do have to say this is the book where things so from plausible to silly.  There is time travel in it, and mystical rock that can show you your future.  All of this stuff should have been thrown out, and they should have kept the realism of the story alive.  I did like this book better because the clues were more based in Disneyland, and the characters were better written.  This one is better then the first one, but you really should read the first one first.  It's not necessary but it will make more sense.
