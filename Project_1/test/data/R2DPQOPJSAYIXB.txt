Beatrice "Tris" Prior was a girl who was looking for something more from her existence. What she ended up with was a revolution.INSURGENT, the second book in the DIVERGENT trilogy, is an action-packed sequel. This book picks up right where the first, Divergent (Divergent Trilogy), so it's recommended that you read that before this installment; there's not much explanation for what went on in the first book.This is a series which offers the reader a futuristic United States and turns the workings of the past on its head. Here we find the aftermath of a plot which happened in the end of DIVERGENT and how everyone, Tris in particular, is dealing with it. Politics shift as much as faction thought processes. No one seems trustworthy. Secrets are revealed, and they are some very big secrets. This, in my opinion, is what makes this series a compelling read. At first I was worried that author Veronica Roth would go through the "sophomore slump" some authors go through with a second or third book, but this world is well thought out and brought into bigger scopes. We see more of the other factions, how they work and how their beliefs drive them. It's fascinating.Tris is not the girl from the first book. She's very much a hardened warrior now. She's flawed, but this is where her strength come from. I was surprised by the way she spoke and acted sometimes--like I said, she's a very different person. Everything about her felt real; the most compelling thing about her is her attempt to reestablish her relationships with her friends and brother. I still had a hard time digesting her romance with Four. It felt so forced upon the book, not something that happened naturally.I was also taken aback by some of the violent scenes which happened. Of course, because of the situations that are happening, violence is expected, but sometimes it felt random. I found myself asking, "Why did that happen?" on more than several occasions.There are new plot threads which are introduced that are, I hope, brought to light in the final installment of this series. These are done so well that I don't even mind them. I forsook chores and only took small breaks to eat and such to read this book, and I thought it was well worth it. My eyes are not thanking me for the marathon of reading, but to be in the world of the Divergent is a great risk.
