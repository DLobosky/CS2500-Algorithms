It's 2 hours long but seeing how it was released straight to DVD, why not make it 4 hours long?The orignal Woodstock film was 3 hours long (directors cut 40 more mins added) but the also used a double screen alot to get more in the movie, I wish this epic even was given the same treatment.You had sych historical recordings....The Doors......Jim Morrison's last libe stage peformance and he sounded great!  Jim didnt want the spot lights in the band, so they are shown playing in almost total darkness and when they do "The End" it just has that great feeling to the song, I wish they showed more of the Doors or release the complete performance of them.One thing  I like about this film was the realism, I get so sick of hearing about "wooodstock" that it was 3 days of Peace and LOve....BS!  The hippies crashed the fences and didnt give a crap about the promoters and other men and and women who put the festival on. Feeling they can just storm in and not have to pay for an event and just stiff the promoters to have to dig in their own pockets to pay the artists and everything else,  With Woodstock, the promoters already had a film and record deal signed and wasnt too concernd about tickets but they still took a huge financial hit, but Isle of Wight, same crap, young punks tearing down the fences to get in, too cheap tom pay 3 pounds, it wouldnt kill them, but them all crashing the fences cost the promoters their asses!  Great documentary about the so called "love child" generation that were just as selfish and spoiled as the ME generation, same crap, different title.Wish the film were longer but it is what it is.
