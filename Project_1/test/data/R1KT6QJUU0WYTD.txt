It's very easy to read from just about any distance. The best part of this watch, the interchangeable bands: black, coffee, pink, white, and turquoise. The bands are all shiny leather and have a bit of a metal flake look to them, not unlike a deep automotive finish. No tools are required to change the bands, there is a small metal bump on the band, push it inward, the band pin retracts from the hole in the watch, and, boom, the band is released. It takes two minutes to change bands. Of course moving that pin requires some strong fingernails, but it does move. Sweet design.This is a practical watch. Style is retro, and a bit unusual. The watch is just over one half inch thick, fairly thick for a woman's watch. One inch wide and almost two inches long, the watch is about average size. The face is a nice mother of pearl. The numbers are well machined and attached to the top of the mother of pearl face (they are not inlaid as with a lot of watches). There is no date. This is a simple time keeper with a sweep second hand. The watch is electric and water resistant to one hundred feet. If you can find this watch available, it is a beauty.
