From experience, there's no substitute for the real cartridge. I've had multiple disappointments with refilled cartridges, so I only buy new. That way, the quality is a known factor. In my 3620 HP printer, this cartridge lasts a good long time, and I print documents and photos! The HP28 cartridge is one of the best. It has plenty of ink.
