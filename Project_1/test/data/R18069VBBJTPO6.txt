I buy a lot on Amazon. I review only the great disappointments. This purchase was one. It simply didn't work. I could ping the router for only a minute or two before the connection would die. If you cannot sustain a connection to the router, then you have no access to the network. Tech support is swamped. I called twice today and an operator was taking messages, promising that someone would return the calls. No-one call. So bad equipment, bad tech support. Plain bad. Avoid.
