This film shows the worst part of our justice system.  It shows how someone (any one of us) could be accused of a crime and convicted of it without any evidence at all.  It also shows  how small towns can make their own version of the law by their ignorance.  Watch the movie and decide who you think did it!  The evidence is there.  But, not for the boys in jail for it.
