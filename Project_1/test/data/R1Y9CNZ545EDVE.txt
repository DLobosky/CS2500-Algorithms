First off, I really don't care about the "these are outtakes and demos that Eddie tweaked" so-called "controversy." I'm of the camp that believes that EVERY band does this. The album SOUNDS great. What more could you possibly want?Second, this is the heaviest album the band has recorded since Eddie became enamored with synths and other keyboards. This isn't a Van Hagar-era "that's what dreams are made of" or "some kinda alien pulls the string and love comes walking in" trip down memory lane. The center of THIS sweet isn't soft or creamy, it's CHEWY. The band has something to prove, and they are lean and mean. If the first album (Van Halen) made you a believer, get ready to believe again.Roth, especially, is practically feral on this one. Eddie once made a comment, near the beginning of Sammy's tenure in the band, that they'd grown weary of "ripping the kids off with a clown show." And Roth's last album...a strange mix of cover versions, Diamond Dave...didn't exactly bode well for his future. He's roaring on this one.I'm still not thrilled that the band squeezed out Michael Anthony, but it is what it is. His vocals are missed more than his bass playing, but somehow the right knobs got twiddled in the studio and the trademark harmony vocals, for the most part, have been reconstructed.The album...clocking in at 50 minutes...is MUCH more generous than, say Diver Down. I still don't like "Tattoo"...I thought it was a weak song when it was first released, and I think it's a weak song not. "The Trouble With Never" sounds like a mash-up between one of the goofball tracks from Dave's first solo album Eat 'em And Smile and "Panama." You are not going to hear anything really "new" or "trailblazing" here...just Roth being Roth and Eddie being Eddie. And in all honesty, isn't that what most of us were hoping for?It's especially nice, after Eddie's various health problems (self-inflicted or otherwise), he's clean, sober, and can still play rings around any guitarist who decided he wanted to "be like Eddie" back in the day. There's no shortage of guitar, no shortage of Eddie just RIPPING on one lead after another.28 years between albums with Roth, and the major difference...as noted above...is that this is a return to the harder-edged sound of the band, with keyboards / synths wither absent or pushed back in the mix.Whether any of these songs make it onto the band's 2012 concert set list doesn't matter. The Roth era of Van Halen always felt like unfinished business. I'm a fan of Sammy Hagar dating back to his Montrose days, but didn't really care for much of the pop / "album-oriented radio" / "power ballad" material he churned out in his Van Halen days. Roth is back in Van Halen, Sammy and Michael are in Chickenfoot...in my view, everybody wins.I bought the CD and made a mix CD for the car, minus "Tattoo." If I loaded the commercial CD into my deck, I'd probably skip "Tattoo" every time anyway. What I ended up with was 45 minutes of brutal, prime Van Halen, with many nods to the past. Does this band have "legs?" Will there be another Roth studio album after this one? With Van Halen, you never know. The last Hagar studio album...Balance...came in 1995. The regrettable Gary Cherone album, followed in 1998. From that point, it was "the sound of silence" from the band, unless you count the 3 "new" Hagar tracks on The Best Of Both Worlds (US Release).All that matters, in 2012, is that they have a solid new album that is faithful to their fans and faithful to their roots, and they'er going on tour. What happens beyond that...like everything else in their decades-spanning career...is anybody's guess.
