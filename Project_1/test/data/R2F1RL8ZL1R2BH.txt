What that means to you is that it is identical to the retail product but without the fancy colorful box describing all its features.  The lack of the expensive packaging often means a lower price to you.  On any OEM product listing like this, look over the item's "contents" closely in the description:  some OEM products may contain just the unit, or just the unit and the book, etc.There are lighter bluetooth headsets on the market, but most of them are more expensive, less comfortable, and easier to lose than they are to use.  I've tried the earlier Motorola (HS700), the S9 ROKR, a Jabra and one of Motorola's "wire hook with tiny peg for the ear" models, and this one is my favorite.  Is it bigger than most bluetooth headsets?  Yes, but still tiny enough to conceal in the palm of your hand.  It it heavier than newer sets?  Not by very much.What puts the HS850 ahead of the others I've tried is this:  it's comfortable.  There's something about the ear hook's texture that is exactly what the human ear needs.  It has a hard plastic arch along the outer edge to hold it steady, and the soft arm feels almost exactly like the cartilage your ear is made from.  It's perfect in that it holds fairly tight but doesn't make your skin heat up and throb after an hour with it on.  I've also found that I prefer a speaker that sits on top of the ear to one that must be jammed down in it, no matter how many soft attachments come with it to ease the impact.  Buttons for volume are easy to access and powering the unit on is as simple as flipping open the mic arm...this also means it's harder to accidentally leave turned on, or to forget to turn the unit off.Battery life is fairly strong in that you can talk steadily for two hours and still have time left over for a phone call or two before having to charge.  Charging is also fairly quick, often completing fully in less than an hour.  However, charging is the real weak spot of this headset.  First, there isn't really much of a warning when the battery is low.  The lights don't seem to provide me with any idea, and once the unit starts softly beeping in my ear, I usually only have a minute or two left to shut it off.  Second, the connector for the charger is difficult to use:  the release button needs to face the underside, and you have to pinch hard to get the release to let go when charging is done.This isn't the most elegant of headsets, but if you prefer quality to style, you can't go wrong with the HS850.
