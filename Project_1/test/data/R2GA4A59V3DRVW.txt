It was George A. Romero who created the original, Night of the Living Dead (Color + B&W) (1968).  It was a low-budget film that since has become a major success. It is almost mandatory that if you enjoy horror movies, you must see "Night Of The Living Dead (1968).  It has become a cult classic and movie buffs have seen it many times, preferably an unedited version as broadcast television does edit the film.  There is an unedited European version available on DVD now and a computer-colorized version shown on television and available on DVD.

Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) is a powerful man who owns the skyscraper building in the city that is fenced off from zombies. He is suppose to pay the men for their zombie-killing military skills.
