"Audrey Hepburn."I'm supposed to have more than a one word review here. Amazon's rules. Two words will do just fine. "Audrey Hepburn." There was that other guy, whatshisname, the one about as nameless in my memory as Cat, but the guy we men all want to be.Sleek and sophisticated, clever and innocent, beguiling yet without guile: Hepburn demonstrates her natural ability to dance without moving and love without ever having met the audience. She was of an era and grace when poise mattered.And best of all, the writer gets the girl. The good guy finishes first.Swoon with me, and watch this perfect movie once again. Buy it, own it, never let it go. It is all we've got, really, of Holly Golightly, of the Audrey Hepburn we love.I'm disappointed the have nothing particularly special on the DVD, or a boxed set. A complete boxed set is the way to go, including all her her pre-&quot;Roman Holiday&quot; stuff.I fully recommend this movie, and obsessively so.Did you see &quot;Sabrina&quot; yet? Get that one too.Anthony Trendl
