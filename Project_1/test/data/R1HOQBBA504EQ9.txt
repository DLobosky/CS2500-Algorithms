Again, like out other son, we didn't want to invest a lot of money in an high end camera for what he was going to use it for. Mostly to keep intouch with us and his brother.  The resolution is crisp and clear and the 510 has great software like video editing motion detection feature that automatically starts recording when the camera detects movement. It's easy to save and send pics via e-mail. Or live video streaming with audio. The optics are very good such as brightness, contrast, hue etc on the 1.3 MP Like the 420 works great in low light indoor operation.Like the 420 the case is plastic and as a toy-like feel to it; but if you can get past that this is an excellent value for the money.When I rate an item on Amazon I like to keep the rating in perspective. I would not compare a bottom of the like Chevy to a loaded Lincoln. There just not in the class or price range.  As with the 510 I compare it with the creative Labs PC-Cam 600 not with a top of the line Minolta which is to expensive for kids to use.
