His first effort was Chess: The Art of Logical Thinking: From the First Move to the Last, which includes mostly modern games and a few classics, all grouped by opening. His second effort,[...] covers all modern games, grouped by strategic theme. When the writer's notes are mostly prose, as they are in these two books, the writer has a tendency to disconnect the prose with the relevant variations. I felt that McDonald does a better job handling this connection using classic games than he does in using the more modern games. So, in this sense, the first book is a little better and targeted at a slightly lower rated audience. The first book also begins its move-by-move approach in the opening, where the planning book assumes that the reader already has that phase of the game under control.It doesn't help that modern games are extremely complex affairs. Modern games require precise, razor-sharp calculation, in addition to highly sophisticated strategic thinking. [...]The problem with McDonald's annotation style is that he tends to gloss over important variations. When notes are mostly prose, it's important to include the most important suboptimal variations that your lower-rated readership might want to see. [...]Both books have typos and comma usage errors, the Art of Planning more so than Logical Thinking. In general, McDonald's move-by-move books are good if you've already gone through the more classic books mentioned in this review and are looking for more. The notes will not harm your play, they just don't prove to be inspiring.
