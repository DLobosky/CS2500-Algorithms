These do exactly what they should, fit well, don't cut off the circulation, and protect your knees. The black pair is very nice, exactly what was needed for the volleyball team. The padding is just right. These are well priced. There's more expensive pads, unless you are a professional, probably not worth the extra money. One size fits all, hard to say what that means. At this value, it's easy enough to order them and if they don't fit return them.
