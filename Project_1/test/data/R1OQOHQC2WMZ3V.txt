Seems a little late to make a review ;) but I must say that this is an excellent book, of course kind of outdated now as many of the commands are deprecated now but what I love about FOED books is their commitment with teaching and they do it the right way! developing an application entire application from scratch guiding you step by step. FOED Books RULE!
