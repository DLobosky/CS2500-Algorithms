I was so happy to see that this movie was different than most super hero movies. It had a lot more action in it and the super hero characters portrayed a different role as well. Hit Girl was amazing in this movie. It's nice to see that children can be a super hero as well. I would also like to add that this movie isnt just for the men. It's entertaining enough to keep women on the edge of their seats as well.WARNING: There is a lot of blood and violence in this movie. Also there is a little girl who kills and uses profanity. If any of this bothers you then you should pass on watching this Awesome movie.If none of the above bothers you then check out Kick Ass today...you won't be disappointed.
