A church should be count that which matters so that it can be better at accomplishing the work of the Lord.The Three Top Ideas of Greatest Benefit:1. Counting is a sign of reality. The book states that "since it is easier to stop counting, than to make changes, they simply stop counting." This is one of the greatest problems in the church. The desire to pretend everything is great in declining congregation. Instead of facing reality, it is easier to ignore the decline and death of a congregation. In counting, you are keeping a congregation accountable.2. Attendance does matter. Often in the church, people will discount attendance because of the perception that it is not important. This is usually an attitude of a declining congregation. But attendance does tell a story. This is why it must be tracked and monitored. The attendance details reflect if the congregation is winning the war in spreading the gospel as well as reaching into the community.3. The idea of tracking the guests to a congregation is so important. Often this never happens. But if a guest comes, there should be a tracking on whether or not this person stays and continues worshipping and serving with the church. By tracking this, if the process of assimilation is not working, there can be a realistic picture of what needs to change and what is working well. Probably most congregations have no clue on how many people come and go as guests.The Three Ideas of Major disagreement:1. The book claims that churches recruit on organizational need. This is really not the case. Often churches have little or any selection for future leaders. It is almost a warm body is better than no body. Sometimes churches put people in roles that they are not skilled enough to perform. But there is a good feeling because someone is on the books to be in charge of a certain ministry. Though, nothing is happening in the work.2. At first, it seemed that I disagreed with the book's focus on some much counting. It seemed to be less spiritual. But as I read, the book was excellent in telling the reader what to count and why it is important. There might need to be some changes in the approach for average church members that have a dislike towards numbers, but the book does build a strong case for counting.The Recommendation of the Book:I would recommend this book because of the excellent job of defining what needs to be counted and why these results are important. It breaks down the church growth process into helpful measurements to ascertain the effectiveness of a congregation.
