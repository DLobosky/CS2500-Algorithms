The Last Princess by Galaxy Craze was one awesome read! It was one of those books that I knew within the first 10 pages that I was going to love it. I read straight through this one, devouring every page.I loved the plot - it was constant action and a lot of intrigue. The plot doesn't let up for a moment, so it was a really fast paced read. My one complaint about The Last Princess is that some of the pacing felt a bit off. The first half of the novel was very nicely paced, but a ton happened in the second half and it seemed like it should have been a bit more spread out.The world Galaxy Craze has created in The Last Princess is eerie and frankly, downright scary at parts. I just loved it. It was so easy to get caught up in the characters world, and with that, be very swept into the plot.The characters in The Last Princess were a really strong set. I really liked Wesley - I wished he had had a bit bigger of a role, as he was wonderful.  Eliza was a really strong heroine, I really liked her as well. I do wish the character motivations had been explored a bit more in-depthly, as what they did made sense and worked but you never really knew why.The ending was very clever. I cannot wait to see what follows it with the rest of Eliza's story in the sequel.  The characters in this book each had such a unique tale to tale - I would especially love to know Portia or Westley's history. I really just loved this one a ton.I would definitely recommend The Last Princess to everyone! It's a very cool dystopian in the sense you never really have an idea of what year you are in. I loved the plot and the characters were great - a must read!
