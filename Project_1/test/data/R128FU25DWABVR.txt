We decided the best thing was to get a new hard drive.  Luckily I got the machine to boot and run long enough to back up her data.  She needed a backup plan, but I didn't expect her to have the discipline to maintain a backup plan involving an external drive.  So I had the idea to get her a big enough SD card to hold her documents, favorites, etc.  She's not a photographer or videographer so the 8GB was plenty.We plugged this card into the built in card reader, set up Microsoft's Sync Toy and now she shouldn't have to worry about losing her data again.  At least it's better than no backup at all.I didn't measure the performance of the card, but it is plenty fast for backup and was at a great price for 8GB.  The frustration free packaging is indeed free of frustration.  I loved it.Summary: The card is recommended highly!
