I've purchased a number of: headphones, behind-the-neck headphones, and earbuds. The earbuds become painful after a short period of wearing them, some of them fall out easily. Many of the headphones feel like vises. Other behind-the-neck headphones move around too much or become dislodged from my ears when I move my head.These headphones are so lightweight they are barely noticeable. They stay on my head. The left ear piece does, however, become dislodged enough that I must reposition it. One thing I did not care much for was the fact that I had to turn the volume up quite a bit over other types of headphones.So, when the ear pieces stay lodged in the ear canal -- and -- with the volume turned up, these are very comfortable and enjoyable.
