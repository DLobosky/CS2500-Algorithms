First, I'd like to say that if you haven't seen this movie, go see it RIGHT NOW.  The action is amazing, but equally good is the plot and music score.  Also, the extended sequences in the DVD really help in  understanding the plot as well as heightening the action sequences.That  said, I had high hopes for the DVD, especially the 5.1 sound and picture  quality.  On the sound, I was not dissapointed:  it was amazing, especially  in the running battle at the end.  The image, however, left a lot to be  desired, which is why I only gave this movie 3 stars.  The MPEG conversion  of the movie (the process where they convert the 35 mm film into DVD  format) was definitely sub-par, almost to the point of being unwatcheable  (as in the waterfall scenes).  It seems that quick motion did not encode  well, resulting in a blurryness and pixelation in many scenes.Therefore,  while the movie was excellent, the DVD version leaves a lot to be desired.
