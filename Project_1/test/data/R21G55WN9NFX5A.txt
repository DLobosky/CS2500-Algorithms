We put it on right after all the kids finished opening presents and they all stopped playing and congregated by the CD player.  Wow they loved it.  These songs are beautifully produced.  Simple songs, simple instrumentation, beautiful voises, nice arrangements.  A very friendly CD.And a big YES - the addition of forefront children's voices adds a familial charm to the music.  Its a pleasure to have such user friendly music in our world filled with gaga trash.
