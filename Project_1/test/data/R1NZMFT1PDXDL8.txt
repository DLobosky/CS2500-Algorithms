I purchased this at the same time as my saw, and installed it before it's first use.  This support was very useful for holding long heavy pieces in place while turning off the saw.  The long pieces of plywood I was cutting would not have stayed in place without it.  This should probably be standard on the saw.  Installation took about 15 minutes, and wasn't very difficult.
