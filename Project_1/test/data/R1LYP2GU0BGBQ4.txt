Seperately, they are average.The other two books begin in the limo riding to the BDSM that night. This book starts six weeks earlier with Dani finally deciding that she is going to scratch her itch and learn about being a dominatrix from one of the best around, Troy, at a new club in town. Troy agrees and together he and his partner/lover Ransom work with Dani over the 6 weeks training her inner Dom. (although she knows how to play dom, she is really more sub and that comes out for experimentation too). While under Troy's tutalage, she sees the hunky head of security, Max, at the bar day after day. The bulge in his pants and twinkle in his eye lets Dani know she is not alone in her attraction, but Master Troy delays their satisfaction until her training is done- that fateful night when the three best friends travel together to Club L. You also learn how Dani conspired with Max to get Nat to act on her passion for him, (book 1) and how Dani struggles to approach Ransom and Troy about Megan who she thinks would be perfect for the two of them (book 2). All I can say is the walls must be soundproof with all the screaming that went on that night! And how any of them made their legs move the next day to argue with the senator and go out to brunch is beyond me. It's fiction. The rest of us would have been in a sex coma.
