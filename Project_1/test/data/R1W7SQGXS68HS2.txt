My father-in-law gave me this book when I showed an interest in shooting. He said that although it is pretty old, it contains a lot of useful information. Man, was he right.Jim Carmichel recently retired as the shooting editor for Outdoor Life magazine, after many years in this position. He is one of the leading expert on rifles, so you can imagine that his books contains a ton of useful information. I was somewhat surprised about the amount of historical content contained, but found it helpful in understanding modern rifles, and the cartridges they shoot. The books is a pretty quick read and contains many useful photos as well.If you want to learn a lot about rifles, this book is an excellent resource. It is written by an expert, so I recommend it.
