Since we haven't taken the 2nd Magic Jack to the Philippines just yet (we're going there the 22nd of December), we decided to purchase $20 worth of overseas calls just for this partial week, at 18 cents a minute to the Philippines.  It works but limits your calls to installments of 3-4 minutes before you have to re-dial the number.  I'm hoping that the reliability will be much better once I install Magic Jack at my in-laws house later this week in Cavite, Philipines... since THEN we will have a Magic Jack at both ends of the line. I will update this review once we have returned from the Philippines and I've had a chance to try FREE calling both ways, to and from the Philippines.  So far overall, I give it 3 stars,,, just so-so.UPDATE 2/11/11:I returned from the Philippines almost 5 weeks ago. While there I set up a Magic Jack with a local number here. It works OUTSTANDING! I have changed the rating to 5 stars from 3. Now my in-laws there can (from the Magic Jack phone) dial my area code and local phone number and reach me in less than 5 seconds after dialing my number.  When I call their local number HERE with ANY phone, it rings their Magic Jack phone (hooked up to THEIR computer) and it rings the phone in the Philippines.  It doesn't have to be a Magic Jack at both ends!  By the way, we have only had one dropped call out of perhaps a hundred calls both ways!  No 4 minute limit anymore. We no longer use Magic Jacks international call rates! Free calls BOTH directions. Synopsis.  You only need ONE Magic Jack overseas for calls in both directions! I love it!  Very clear sound too!  We only use our Magic Jack here in the U.S. to make free long distance calls within the U.S. and Canada.
