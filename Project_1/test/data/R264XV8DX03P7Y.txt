I wasn't quite scared, but I just felt that I was going to walk out of the theatres and see zombies. I think the reason why this is the case was because it was around 11 or so at night and the movie theatre was in a mall (coincidentally). There was good acting. I actually just saw the original Dawn of the Dead (you should see that too) and I thought it would be the same, it had the same idea, but the remake had a slightly different plotline. So don't get the idea that you're going to see the same movie. Honestly, the remake was very well done. It really showed what a horror such a thing would be. Basically, it's about a group of people try to lock themselves in the mall to avoid contact with the growing number of zombies on the outside world. Don't forget to watch the end (credits). It was a little creepy. I think what had me a little creeped out was not quite the zombies, but the way they showed the chaos on the news in the movie. It was almost like a preview of some similar type of chaos, whether it is biological or a viral outbreak. I know this movie will most likely have a lot of people scared.This is one movie I would not like the concept to ever be reality! I really recommend it if you like any and all types of zombie movies, and even if you liked Shaun of The Dead.
