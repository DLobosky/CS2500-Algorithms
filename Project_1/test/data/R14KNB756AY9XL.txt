I hate throwing batteries away, so after I bought a Wii I went on a hunt for a rechargeable battery pack for the remotes. This is the best one I found because you don't have to remove the sleeve or the Wii MotionPlus, the back light turns from blue to green to let you know the battery pack is fully charged, and the remotes are magnetically held in the cradle. I've had it for about 2 years now and never had a problem. I also picked up a quad charge base for a friend last year, and despite having to replace the 1st unit when it wouldn't power up, she likes it as much I like mine.If you have a black Wii remote with a black sleeve, you won't be able to charge it on this base without cutting or burning a hole in the sleeve. The sleeve on the white Wii remote is transparent while the black sleeve is solid. In order for the charging process to work there's an eye on the cradle that has to "see" an eye on the battery. Using a razor blade, I cut a very small hole in the underside of the black sleeve to line up with the eye on the battery and now it charges fine.
