This is one of the best of the Sagas I have read.  Egil Skallagrimsson is a fascinating character.  He is a skilled poet.  He's a powerful warrior.  He is angry, antisocial, psychotic, and moody.  The saga tells his story in a wonderfully straightforward prose style.  It's as much a page-turner as any modern novel.  Egil's Saga is included in "The Sagas of Icelanders" also published by Penguin Classics.  That is the version I own.  It seems that many of the sagas from that collection are published in single volumes.  If you're interested in Sagas, the big book is a much better value than buying them all seperately.
