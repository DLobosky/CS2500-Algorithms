This is a good example of Hollywood taking a successful cult film and making a sequel that doesn't have any of the attributes that made the original so good. It's also a good example of Hollywood throwing a lot of money at a project without earmarking some of it for a decent script. Did the filmmakers get greedy or lazy? It's hard to tell. Probably both. Instead of rehashing what was bad about it, I'll tell you the one good thing about it: it's over.
