Both books cover pretty much the same territory, although "Black Swan" puts many more "memes" out there ("Mediocristan," etc.). But what is interesting in "Randomness" is Taleb's relative degree of humility, and his focus on understanding his own weaknesses in order to understand others,' and (possibly) profit from them. He describes how he learned to accept and deal with the fact that we are not rational except in a limited way. He identifies the "rational actor" as a normative construct in the mind of economists and their models, with little connection to reality (the best line of the book is his statement that "Normative economics is like religion without the aesthetics" (p. 189)). The "epiphany" Taleb says he had is the recognition that "our brains are made for fitness, not for truth" (p. 197), and that the emotions pouring out of his "fit" brain are actually necessary:  they allow him to make decisions and give him the energy to execute them.  Trying to become the economists' notional "rational man" and eliminate emotion, therefore, is not only unworkable, it's undesirable (p. 222). Without our emotions and the irrationality that flows out of our emotional responses, it would take us "an eternity to reach the smallest conclusion or perform the smallest act" (p. 187); we would be "incapable of making the simplest decision" (p. 202).  It is our emotions that "prevent us from temporizing" (p. 202). In fact, he says, those people who actually are purely rational turn out to be brain-damaged: they have "a defect in the amygdala" (p. 240).  In order to counteract our inherent biases created by an "unintelligent" set of genes (p. 222), biases that are natural and even desired consequences of the integration of our emotional and rational brain systems, we should be ferreting out the biases and holding them up to the light, and then once they are identified "we need to accept the fact that we are mere animals in need of lower forms of tricks" to deal with them (p. 233). Among the biases are the fact that our brain relies on "quick and dirty heuristics" -- shortcuts -- to solve problems, which have the side effect of creating biases (p. 188). One bias is to be emotionally affected more by losses than by gains (and thus to irrationally avoid large numbers of small losses even when they are likely to lead to larger offsetting gains); another is to recognize differences among things better than we do absolutes, and to allow our perceptions of facts and conclusions to be skewed by anchor or surrounding "facts" that are really irrelevant (p. 193).  Further, "we are not made to view things as independent from each other" but instead we are biased to "immediately [] establish a causal link" between two things that may well be unrelated (p. 230), and to "favor the narrated" (p. 262).  Because of this genetically determined bias in favor of causality, "it is emotionally harder to reject a hypothesis than to accept it" (p. 230).  Our task as thinking human beings he says, is to recognize that we are genetically programmed "to be fooled," and that we therefore have to stay on our guard (p. 218). Taleb, the thinking man, describes with pride how he "start[s] every meeting by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it" (p. 243).  He has also cut himself off  from the distracting cultural "noise" by watching TV only with the sound off, by reading only analysis ("The New Yorker") and no daily reporting ("The Wall Street Journal"), and, apparently, at least prior to publication of this book, by spending a lot of time by himself. All of this is very true, and very admirable.  The tone in "Black Swan" is quite different, and it appears that Taleb may have failed to heed his own maxim in "Randomness" that "[t]oo much success is the enemy" (p. 181).
