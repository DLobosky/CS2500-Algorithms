**UPDATE**Since the untimely death of Michael Jackson, I am compelled to update my review to include my thoughts about the character Powder and the strong parallel he makes to the King of Pop.  If ever there was a man who suffered such senseless persecution and indignities because he was "different", it was Michael Jackson.  Brilliantly gifted, highly evolved, and amazingly gentle and kind, he compelled us to care, to help to change the world.  How incredibly heart-breaking that he died before the mainstream recognized his message.Michael Jackson was the  modern day poster child for "bullying".  This film is so relevant for today.  It's an amazing story and should be considered as educational curriculum in schools.Powder was recommended by a friend. I saw it two years ago and found myself overcome with emotion and in tears at the end.  Yesterday evening, I happened to catch it on a local station and found myself as absorbed in the movie as if I had never seen it before!  As others have stated, the movie  has flaws but nothing is perfect!  Powder was so enlightened and  sensitive.  His strength came not from bravado, but from insight, caring,  and a deep respect for and love of life.Because I'm an animal lover, the  scene with the dying doe was almost more than I could watch.  It's as if I  knew what he was going to do before he did it!  It was scary!  I knew that  Powder was only going to exist on Earth a short time.  He was far too  intelligent and elevated in his thinking and empathy to live among us  humans in this world. I could sense the pain he experienced from watching  how we treat each other and other creatures. It was a well-done example of  the best and worst of humanity--exposing the fears that form our  prejudices, and opening our hearts to allow the purest, deepest feelings to  surface.This is a beautiful story about a beautiful human being.  I  highly recommend it to everyone!
