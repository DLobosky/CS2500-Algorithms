I think this is her best book about Nascar.  It's more tightly woven with the characters.  I'm not going to write a plot summary because Amazon and a couple reviewers have did that better than I can.  However I enjoyed the interaction of the characters.  I loved the little girl and how she kept getting involved in everything especially getting her dad a job.  You see the two previous couples in the story and find out what they have been doing.  I'm really enjoying this series when I didn't think I would.  I thought it would be sappy and not have enough about Nascar in it.  Instead I've found that the books even have some of the inside politics incidents and the rubbing is racing in them.  I would highly recommend this to any Nascar fans.  Great book to take to the race and read in the morning before the race starts and RaceDay on Speed begins.  Also a great beach book.
