The luscious detailed images that appeared on a large 1080p projection screen looked more like a movie made last year than one made in 1962. The main reason the films look so good is that all twenty of the pre-Craig Bond movies were cleaned up and restored with great care by Lowry Digital Images, using the original camera negatives. The first nine films (including "Dr. No" and "Live and Let Die" from this set) were all scanned at a whopping 4K resolution, and the other eleven were re-mastered at full HD 1920x1080 resolution - a perfect fit for Blu-ray disc. While the 12 megapixel (4000x3000 pixel) mastering of the first nine films may seem like overkill, for 1080p high definition's 2 Megapixel image, the results speak for themselves. The sound is no slouch either, with the films re-mastered in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround (the original mono or stereo track is also included on each of the older films, for the purists). The producers went back to the original master recordings, cleaned up the audio and created a truly immersive surround sound stage for each film. If you haven't seen the early Bond movies before, then you're in for a treat with these Bond classics on Blu-ray. As to compatibility, it is important to note that some players (notably the Samsung BD-P1500 and LG BH200) do currently have playback problems on these discs. It's important to know that if you own one of these players. But this should not be a reflection on the software, just because the player manufacturers have improperly implemented the Blu-ray specifications.  Also, LG and Samsung have committed to providing firmware updates to fix any playback issues with these titles. Also, most of the current generation players (including the newer Panasonic and Sony players with the latest firmware applied) have no problems playing these discs. Full reviews of each of these Blu-ray discs are available on Big Picture Big Sound.
