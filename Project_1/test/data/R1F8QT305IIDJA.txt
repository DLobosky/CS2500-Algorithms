It is interesting to see how they interpreted this story.  The Thing continues to wear his uniform that he had on when he crashed the spaceship even though it gets torn up by the dogs and also burned.  This just makes it cooler as you see The Thing with the partially torn uniform.I say 'he' but really The Thing is asexual.  This is what makes the creature so frightening.  It exists only to survive.  It has no need for a heart, no emotions, etc..It's frightening because perhaps somehow we realize that creatures like this really exist.If you want to see a real evil creature that crashed its spaceship and died watch:Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?
