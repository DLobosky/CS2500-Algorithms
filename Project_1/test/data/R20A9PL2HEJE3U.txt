That would be my biggest gripe about this, that a lot of time is spent giving pointers that beginners can use but intermediates already know. Also, I think the faster tempo reps on the weight exercises are too fast. Instead of flailing my arms about trying to keep up, I do the reps at a slower, more controled pace. She does so many reps that even at a slower pace I get all the reps I need.All the weight work is upper body. All the cardio is lower body. Not my style. I felt it worked my inner thighs/glutes but not much else.
