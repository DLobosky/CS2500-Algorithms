In its presentation of science-meets-psychedelia-meets-gnosticism, "What the Bleep Do We Know!?" portrays a late modern (bourgeois) liberalism at the height of its discontent, seeking parallel universes to fly to in order to escape the emotional and physical difficulties of the present moment.  The point of this flight is for humanity to reach its fullest potential: the liberal longing for "ultimate freedom".So what exactly is the point of the movie?  Its non-stop barrage of scientific and New Age discussions amid psychedelic effects and computer animations will likely stir discussion among watchers; "what IS reality?" is a question that you are likely to hear or, perhaps, even ask.  The premise of the movie, "everything is not as it seems", is the premise of every great philosophy and religion, as well as those that fall far short of greatness.  After surveying a certain range of options (limited, to say the least) - quantum physics ("the science of probability"), New Age spirituality and positive thinking - we reach the movie's end.Ironically, by arguing against certain conceptions of "the real" and making a certain strand of science (from the Latin "scientia", meaning "having knowledge") the lens that we are to see by, we are left in exactly same spot we started from: appearance is still reality!  The issue is what hermeneutic we use to uncover these layers; those "in the know", possessing this scientia/gnosis, will see that what things are isn't really what things are, and therefore see them as they really are!  Advocating the superiority of this new position necessitates putting words into other's mouths, making their viewpoint sound inferior, which only serves to validate this new point of view (which happens at the end of the movie against some very childish understandings of religion)."What the Bleep Do We Know!?" advocates a postmodern, New Age quantum physics as the really real by which we judge everything else.  Hence, we have the basis of a worldview founded on what we...don't know.  Perhaps our collective not knowing is the reason for the constant recourse throughout the movie the quantum physics.  Not knowing necessitates a faith in probability - a faith in faith which we can have faith in..., so to speak.But what is probability other than an attempt to do something with - an attempt to do something in the space of - an actual absence?  By making a wager on probability, we find ourselves with an unending distance between the space which we occupy and the space which the Real occupies.  What we are left experiencing is the negative infinity of calculus: ever receding and ever progressing, but never finally absent or fully present.  By putting everything in the realm of the probable, we put everything in flux.  Thus, the question is whether or not an "everything is flux" view - as ancient as the Sophists, to say the least - can really sustain the development of human potential once the flux the ever-present-but-momentary probabile has long since passed.  In the end, I don't think it can.Thus, the close of the movie - Ramtha's statement that "You are God" - comes across as little more than laughable.  An increasingly fragmented society founded upon the individualized individual may very well hear this statement as the sine qua non of freedom, but it utterly precludes communication: the "God" that you are means nothing because it cannot be understood within a frame of reference that you and your neighbor share.  The absence of this shared level of understanding over a concept such as "God" (which, in this movie, still represents something beyond where we are even if it is who we are) will only prevent progress as no one knows who/what/where/when... the God that we are progressing to really *is*.Perhaps what we are best left with at the movie's end is the idea that reality is...probable.
