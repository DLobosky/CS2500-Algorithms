It is not so much a study of what the faith is, but of how the faith came to be. In this day and time, there is a prevailing assumption that the Christian Faith followed one continuous line of agreeement and development.  Yes, there were some persecutions along the way, but it was because everybody believed the same thing and authorities objected to what they believed and tried to eradicate the early Christians and their beliefs Not so fast my friend, as Lee Corso would say. There was no such thing as agreement of what to beleive in the early church. Early Christians were split in many ways on matters such as how to interpret the life of Jesus, what it meant (and means) to be his Disciple or his follower. And did Christ call on us to die as martyrs or to live so that we could spread his message of love, peace and goodwill? (If the early Christians had to die as martyrs to get to Jesus, as some early Church leaders believed, that would put the early Christian Faith in agreement with some of the Islamic beliefs that lead to terrorism today. Die in service of God/Jesus and you go straight to Heaven.) The Gospel of Judas opposes that kind of thinking and is more in line with Christian belief of today than with early church theology. And what about the resurrection? Was it a ressurection of the body as orthodox Christianity professes today or was it a resurrection of the spirit as most Christians sem to beleive today?These are not questions for Bibical times alone. The thought and debate is alive today.  Just what did the life of Jesus mean?  What is true resurrection?  The Bible tells you all you need to know about Jesus, but it does not tell you all there is to know about the man many of us, we Christians, consider God. If Jesus was God, as we claim to beleive, it only makes sense that we try to find out all we can about this man.   "Reading the Gospel of Judas" is part of that study, that search. The Christian Faith has a rich and full texture and history, most of which has been sacrificed on the altar of orthodoxy. As the authors write, The Gospel of Judas may not belong in the Bible, but it certainly does not belong in the trash heap. It is a valuable book in helping us understand the early controversies of the faith. It is history rather than theology, but it does raise interesting theological questions, questions that are still being debated, studied and prayed about today. And one final word (this review has gone on long enough), don't let the radical (and new to some) view of Judas, that he was Jesus' closest Disciple, that Jesus asked him to betray him, take you away from this book. There is value here, even if it is different from what we have been "taught" to beleive.
