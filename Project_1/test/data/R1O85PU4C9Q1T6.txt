This is the real "Let It go". On The Album, "Just Like You", you get the video edition of the song which removes about 50 percent Of Lil Kim's rap verse, Keyshia's add libbing at the end of Lil Kim's rap and the second chorus. If you have the album, I suggest buying this MP3. If you have the album on the an mp3 player, I suggest buying this MP3 and replacing it for the album track. This is also known as "Let it go Extended". As sucky as it was to put the edited video version on the album, I still think buying this mp3 in addition to the album is worth the extra $0.89 Amazon is charging for it.
