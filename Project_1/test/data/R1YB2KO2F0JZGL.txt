With a Hugo nomination and a glowing review from my favorite Sf author, Rob Sawyer, to recommend it, this book looked like a sure-fire winner.  I was quickly caught up in the characters and the plot, and I didn't want to put the book down! I wish I had.  After about 350 pages of pure enjoyment, the book's ending is a Grade B filmmaker's delight that is not only farfetched but inconclusive, resolving the character issues but leaving the central SF question unclear.Wilson is a very talented writer, but he does not seem to be able to handle endings satisfactorily, as both this book and Chronoliths exemplify. If he could correct this weakness, Wilson could quickly become someone to buy in hardback!If you want to read some great Hugo-nominated SF by a Canadian writer, give this one a miss and pick up Sawyer's own Hominids, which won last year's Hugo, or its sequel, Humans, which is nominated this year.
