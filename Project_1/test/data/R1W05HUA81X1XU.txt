This is the triple disc Cd conterpart to the DVD, The Dave Matthews Band live at Central Park. It is packed with 20 songs, including DMB classic's through 2003. It contains the original line-up of Dave Matthews, Carter Beauford, Stefan Lessard, LeRoi Moore, & Boyd Tinsley. Also, it includes the guest musicians of Butch Taylor on keyboards & Warren Haynes (a guitar player & member of the Allman Brothers Band & his own band Government Mule). This is a "landmark" concert. I think there were around 80,000 in attendance. Anyway, this is some great "live" music, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!
