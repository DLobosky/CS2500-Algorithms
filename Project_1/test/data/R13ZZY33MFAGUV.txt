This book was recommended to me during a conducting workshop.  The teacher, an extremely knowledgeable musician and gifted and hardworking conductor, hated this book upon FIRST reading, and as he explored the concepts and analyses further found more enlightenment and wisdom.  You can tell the folks who didn't like this book are writing off the cuff.In The Compleat Conductor, Gunther Schuller gives us his philosophy and a short history of conducting, and then goes into some real detail analyzing eight great classical works and how even the greatest maestros can fail the composer's wishes and ideals.  Schuller is VERY straightforward and covers all of his bases well, and defends his points and decisions and pickiness.  A quote:  &quot;The secret of great artistry and true integrity of interpretation lies in the ability to bring to life the score for the listener (and the orchestra) through the fullest knowledge of the score, so that the conductor's personality expresses itself WITHIN the parameters of the score.&quot;  Schuller maintains that composers like Beethoven and Brahms were very explicit in their desires, and that their music doesn't need all of the extra bells and whistles conductors use to manipulate an audience, and in fact a good number of conductors in the process ignore the finer points of the music.Quote again:  &quot;...all those deviations from the score do not necessarily make the performance 'more natural,''more human.' They may create that illusion--or delusion; they may fool the unknowing, unwary listener into thinking that it was 'exciting,''moving,''authentic,' when in reality the excitement was superficial and the work was grossly misrepresented.&quot;There are points in the book where Schuller then recommends changing this and that in various scores.  But in these sections he more than backs up his reasons--perhaps there is conflict between the manuscript and printed scores, or maybe there is truly a problem in balance due to the power of different instruments, etc.I am now listening to recordings with a new critical ear, and approaching my orchestral work with a refreshed perspective.
