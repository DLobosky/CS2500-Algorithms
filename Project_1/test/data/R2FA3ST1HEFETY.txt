In 21 categories like Travel, Food/Drink, Adjectives, and  Weather, each with between 16-39 words (for a total of more than 500 words), this program allows you to interact with the vocabulary in 5 different ways: by viewing them in a list with their meanings, by doing a multiple choice test, by completing a hangman-like game (with 5 mistakes allowed), by typing in the words (without accents), or by looking at flashcards. In each activity, the word order is randomized and for the multiple choice, puzzle, and write in activities you can save your percentage score. Each activity includes all the words in that category; it doesn't seem to remember what you've already demonstrated learning.This program was well suited to my Kindle 3, and I appreciated that an effort was made to include some regionally distinct vocabulary (marked as LAm, Mex, or Sp). I'm not sure I'd call it "fun" as the product description does, but this is a well-thought-out program with a decent amount and variety of vocabulary, at a reasonable price. I hope there will be more like it for reviewing higher-level vocabulary and vocabulary in other languages.
