Are you someone who is considering buying one of these? Don't necessarily believe all the negative reviews here. It seems many of these people have an ax to grind with Apple, didn't buy this item, and don't want it. That's fine - there are many MP3 players and ipods to meet various needs, but many are slamming the new shuffle just because it doesn't do what they want it to do. Keep in mind that it was created to hold 1000 songs in an incredibly small device. A thin piece of metal smaller than your thumb with 4GB storage is unheard of and amazing. That's the main purpose here and some concessions have been made to allow this - obviously there is no display and, for the first time, the controls are on the headphones instead of the device. The controls, although a little high on the headphones, are easy to use and after just a little use become intuitive. The big issue is whether you like the generic headphones that come with this ipod. Millions of people have no problem with these headphones so if you are one of that group you are fine. One alternative, if you like in-ear headphones, is Apple's $79.00 phones - they sound great compared even to more expensive earphones and stay in during exercise. The other option is to wait for the inevitable slew of adaptors that will be coming out. If you're offended by these options then you are out of luck and can post your 1-Star review here along with the others. Headphone and control issues aside there is only good to report. The voiceover feature is incredibly useful. Even though you know your own music sometimes you don't want to wait even a few seconds to identify a song. Plus you can now use this feature to access different playlists on your shuffle, something you couldn't do with the previous 2 models. All of this adds up to a tiny, surprisingly functional thing of beauty. Some things have been lost to accommodate this but the negativity in some reviews is over the top. If you want a higher level in a bigger package the Nano is available. But, for what you are getting, the new Shuffle is certainly a great product.
