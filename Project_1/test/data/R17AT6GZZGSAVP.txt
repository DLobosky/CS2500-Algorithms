There is no pan-and-scan version of the original theatrical release on either the widescreen or pan-and-scan releases of this DVD! There are film elements in existence that could have been utilized to produce a much better-looking transfer to DVD, but Lucasfilm decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost.  That being said, if it isn't worth their time, why should it be worth yours?Buyer beware.
