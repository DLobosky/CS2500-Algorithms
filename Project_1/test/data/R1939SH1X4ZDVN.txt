These bowls are the perfect size for free feeding my cats kibble and for their water. The Durapet bowls are easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. They are unbreakable, stay put on solid-surfaces, and have no smell whatsoever. My cats enjoy looking at their refection in the water bowl, and these bowls do not give them chin acne.
