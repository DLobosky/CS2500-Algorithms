The book has short sections on the following topics: a short history of pasta; basic types of pasta; making fresh pasta; and basic recipes for beef stock, seven sauces, and short crust pastry.  The rest of the book discusses more than 30 different types of pasta.  Each of the pastas is covered in short sections of 1-2 pages that include the area of origin of the pasta, some history about the pasta, how the pasta is often prepared and served, and one or two recipes for the particular pasta.  The book also has some useful illustrations.This book is not a substitute for an Italian cookbook, and not a substitute for a book on the history of Italian food.  But, the book provides a basic introduction to Italian pasta that the average person can find helpful and easy to use.  Many of the recipes in the book are very basic and easy to do, but some of the recipes are more involved and could be challenging for some persons.
