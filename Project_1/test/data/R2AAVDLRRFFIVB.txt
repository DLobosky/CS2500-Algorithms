This book and its companion (which traces the Beatles' music from its beginnings through "Rubber Soul") demonstrate that there are writers who are serious about the remarkable music of the Beatles.  Apart from Mellers' rather professorial, pedantic book and Riley's excellent, approachable book, there is a dearth of material on the music of the Beatles, apart from their sociological or gender ramifications, their cultural iconic status and their effect on fashion and morals, etc.  And the music is the only aspect of the Beatles that should matter, since they were incredible musicians and their music has clearly withstood the test of time.  Forget other recent books about the Beatles, such as "Meet the Beatles," which reassesses their sociological and gender significance largely by repeating what was previously written about them.  Everett succeeds brilliantly in reviewing the Beatles' music as if he were reviewing the music of any great composer.  For those who do not have a background in music theory, certain parts of this book may be difficult to comprehend.  However, it is worth the effort.  A fine achievement.
