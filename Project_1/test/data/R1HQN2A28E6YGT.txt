This antenna improved reception for all of the stations in the area when compared with our old Terk, especially major network affiliates, but was weak on independent stations.The horizontal plane of this unit made it difficult to adjust in the narrow confines of our attic, and the construction is cheap. It is VERY lightweight, and prone to tipping and falling.Thinking there must be something better, I recently bought a  Philips High Performance Amplified Indoor Uhf/ Vhf/ Fm Antenna, which has a vertical sensor and appears to be an upgrade of the PHD TV3. (The reviews for it are worth reading because several of the reviewers provide some great analysis of what's available.) Like other reviewers, I have found that it performs substantially better with VHF stations, although the UHF performance is not quite as good.Update: Several years ago I read an amazon review that described the Winegard SS-3000 as being far and away the best indoor antenna. I couldn't remember the name, but recently tracked it down and bought one. It really is the Gold Standard of indoor TV antennas. Unlike most others, it is compact, has no rabbit ears, and incorporates modern technology in its design. I was able to buy one from Affordable HDTV in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA. It's more expensive than the others (costs about 100 bucks), but is significantly better.  An identical product is sold by Terk as the TERK HDTVLP Indoor / Outdoor TV and HDTV Antenna.Winegard also sells an outdoor model SS-2000 "Squareshooter" that looks to me like it could easily be mounted indoors. It too has received excellent reviews, although I have not tried it. It sells for about the same price as the SS-3000.  It is also sold by Terk as TERK HD-TVS Slim Profile Outdoor HDtv Antenna.
