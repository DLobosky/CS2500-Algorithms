When I first used Schiff for my quantum mechanics textbook as a graduate student, I don't think that I truly appreciated it--although I did find it more useful than Mertzbacher, Gottfried, or Messiah.  Now, over thirty five years later, I find myself going to it again and again--especially when starting a new research project.  It is the first quantum text that I turn to--beyond a shadow of a doubt!  I especially like its summary of Dirac's bra and ket notation, and its treatment of angular momentum.
