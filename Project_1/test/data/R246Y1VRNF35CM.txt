Despite most of them being released several years ago, they still have a modern look.  However, the main attraction is value.  Many of the silver-finish Mythos speakers are easy to find on sale for over 50% off.  Even at full MSRP, they perform very well for their price.  My configuration is: 2x Definitive Technology Mythos 1 Tower Speaker (Single, Silver) fronts, 1x Definitive Technology Mythos 3 Center Speaker (Single, Silver) center, 2x Definitive Technology Mythos Gem Satellite Speakers (Pair, Black)  surrounds, 1x Epik Sentinel subwoofer (Def Tech supercubes are slick and good for their size, but overpriced).  My receiver is a Denon AVR2310CI 7.1-Channel Multi-Zone Home Theater Receiver with 1080p HDMI Connectivity (aka Denon 890).  It has more than engouh power for me, I usually listen at -20 to -30 db.The Mythos 1 lends a clear, full sound to your entertainment center.  The speakers on your TV cannot compare.  Listening to a cd through Mythos 1's and a capable subwoofer will bring out the full emotion of each song and reveal every detail of the performance.  For home theater, the Mythos 1's perform equally as well.  The sound stage is impressive.  These speakers won't blow your eardrums out but they will (at reasonable volume levels) help provide a depth and realism only available with a decent surround sound system.Overall, the Mythos 1 is an amazing performer for the price and will be the best front speaker for many looking to get great 5.1 performance on a $2000-$2500 budget.  They also make excellent surround speakers at this price (especially when you factor in price of gem stands), but may be overkill.  I will probably pick up 2 more Mythos 1's when I'm ready to upgrade to a 7.1 system, though the Gems are quite capable themselves.
