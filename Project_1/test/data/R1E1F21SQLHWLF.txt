What more can I say? "The Godfather" has everything needed for an excellent novel: crime, love, suspense, sex, revenge, and New York City. Plus, Puzo's crafting of the story is remarkable. The films are good, but the book is excellent. It will always be among my all-time favorite novels. Highly recommended.
