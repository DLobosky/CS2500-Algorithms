It's always a bit tough to come up with a review that doesn't divide strictly along "I agreed with it" or "I didn't" lines. This one may not succeed any better than most, but here goes my attempt. For starters, no matter what side you come down on, you have to like that English writing style. I know he has an international background and even spent time in Africa, but he still is able to write in the old wry and understated and eviscerating British manner. Secondly he is an eloquent and fine storyteller, and gives a very logical presentation of the facts. He always admits the anecdotal nature of his observations, but makes a very compelling case for their considerations nonetheless. It is a sociological masterpiece, in my opinion, and gets as close to the nub of some of the problems of modern western society as one can get without divine revelation.Its weakness, like that of the other work that I have read by him, is that it is basically a collection of editorials, and thus there is overlap and often a continual drumbeat of the same few themes. If I imagine reading 30 Maureen Dowd stories in a row I can generate sympathy for the agony that the other side who have genuinely read through the book must feel. Even for a social conservative it can get a bit tedious, but by and large Dalrymple takes enough fresh perspectives and uses enough varying examples to support his contentions that this is mostly a minor complaint.In all, a very, very good analysis and as succinct and vivid a glimpse of the Thomas Hardy-like irony that has brought us to this point that one is likely to encounter.
