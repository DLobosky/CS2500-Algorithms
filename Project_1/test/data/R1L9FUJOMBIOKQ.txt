Known internationally for subjects ranging from Romeo and Juliet to Cinderella and The Tale of the Stone Flower, Chout or the buffoon was the first of Prokofiev' ballet to be commissioned by Diaghilev in 1915. The story revolves around a buffoon who enlists six other like himself through a hoax and the idiocy they carry out. The ballet in six scenes was a great success at its 1921 premiere witnessed by, among others, Jean Cocteau, Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel.Arriving on stage eight years after his Rite of Spring, Stravinsky called Chout the one modern score he could hear "with pleasure." This raises an issue among those that believe Prokofiev a 20th century romantic: was this a modern work as we now know the early 20th century? Or was it a latter day romantic ballet? Judging from the work here, by Walter Susskind and the London Symphony Orchestra who tilt toward the lyrical and away from the dissonant, he was more a romantic.Prokofiev left an original score in 12 movements included here by Walter Susskind, a Czech conductor with a fine feel for the dance aspects of the score, whose pairing with the London Symphony brings out an elegance that, for some, will be short on temperament. I enjoy Susskind's approach and like the way he does this and other romantic (yes, Prokofiev was as much a romantic as a modernist) music. I very much enjoy Susskind's re-release of Smetana's M&aacute; Vlast [Hybrid SACD] and wish someone would re-release his outstanding 1975 Also Sprach Zarathustra with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra that was such a sound spectacular in its day it had a short life as a quadropheia LP. It was later available as a high quality chrome cassette, but never as a CD.Is Susskind the ideal Prokofiev interpreter? For some, no doubt, the reason this has been returned to currency. But Prokofiev was also a 20th century composer with a modern edge that often escaped Susskind. For dynamism and aggression, other recordings carry more of the ballet's story than this one, remade here by Everest UK from the 1958 Everest recording. Gennadi Rohzdestvensky's recordings Prokofiev: Chout (The Buffoon), Ballet in Six Scenes Op. 21and [[ASIN: B00000HXNS Prokofiev: Overture in B flat major, Op. 42 & Suite from the Ballet "Le Chout", Op. 21 bis carry almost an hour of action compared to the slightly more than half-hour on this recording. Rohzdestvensky's recordings have more fully detailed sound than this one, as well.In some respects, Chout points the way to both the lyricism to come in later ballet and the ferocity of the Symphony No. 3, which I think Rozhdestvensky finds to fuller extent. Also, buyers that like Susskind's approach can search around Amazon and find the original Everest recording linked to the suite from Lt. Kije Chout / Lt. Kije Suite and get the same thing here with more music. This is one of the notable downsides of the new Everest marketing -- the routine failure to offer products anywhere close to the 80 minute limit on a CD when selling the older recordings in the new century. Otherwise, for the Chout suite linked to something else, give Jarvi a try Sergey Prokofiev: Suite from "Chout" ("The Buffoon"), Op. 21a / Suite from "Le Pas d'Acier" ("The Steel Dance"), Op. 41a / Suite from "The Love for Three Oranges", Op. 33a.
