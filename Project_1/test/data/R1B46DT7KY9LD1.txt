If you're going to buy all 3 DVD sets and think you have ALL the Bond movies, don't forget you'll need to purchase (seperate) &quot;NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN&quot; then you'll have the whole set.  Not sure why it's not included in one of the 3 boxes?  And if you don't consider Dr. NO to be the first movie, then you'd also want CASINO ROYALE (again purchase seperate) if you want the complete DVD set.  I think many are going to purchase the 3 DVD sets and give them as presents to a Bond fan saying &quot;here are all the movies&quot; only to find &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; not there or &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (depending on if you consider that to be the first Bond movie.
