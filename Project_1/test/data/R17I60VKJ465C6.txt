I was particularly drawn to the final novelete, "Tits Up in a Ditch" because it covered the most ground and encompassed 3 generations of the Listers, a ranch family of lower economics and backward ways, making them both embarrassing and endearing. Another gem is "Testimony of the Donkey", which reveals the writer's own pith through the character of Catlin, a fiercely independent, modern boheme, who shows us that independent traits can be both rewarding and deadly.When Proulx stumbles, she does so with flair. "I've Always Loved This Place" and "Swamp Mischief" are both stories featuring the Devil, and - while interesting and slightly humorous to read - are both polished coal in an otherwise unique collection of fine stones. They're good efforts, but Mark Twain she ain't. As well, "Deep-Blood-Greasy-Bowl" lopes in to paleo-historic territory and diverges into a writing meter that didn't hold my interest as well as Proulx's familiar, homespun style. When I buy Proulx, I expect Proulx.These low points don't exactly ruin the whole, but they dent a good fender on the vehicle which Proulx drives beautifully around her beloved state of Wyoming.
