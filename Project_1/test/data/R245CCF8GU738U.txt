The brainchild of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, I Love Lucy revolutionized the television industry with its extensive use of a live audience and the employment of multiple camera angles. The result of true comic genius, the show's ability to entertain is just as relevant today as it was fifty years ago...
 
 Real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the prominent roles of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a married couple living in a New York apartment complex. Ricky is a Cuban-born band leader who wows night clubs with his act, while Lucy is a homemaker. Lucy and Ricky's best friends are landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz who often become intertwined in Lucy's get-rich-quick schemes, screwball ideas, and comic shenanigans. Former masters of the stage, the cast comes across as a likeable bunch, with Lucille Ball stealing the show with her goofy antics and brilliant facial contortions. If ever there were a television classic, then I Love Lucy is it...
 
 The I Love Lucy (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere "The Girls Go Into Business" in which Lucy and Ethel buy a dress shop, and then struggle with all things business-related including what to name the store. When they fail to sell a single dress, they're forced to sell off the shop... Other notable episodes include "Equal Rights" in which Lucy and Ethel demand equal rights (which prompts Fred and Ricky to ask for four separate checks for their dinner). When the girls can't pay, they must wash dishes. And "Oil Wells" in which the Ricardo's and the Mertz's get a hot stock tip from their new Texas neighbors, prompting them to investigate as to whether the new couple is a pair of swindlers...
