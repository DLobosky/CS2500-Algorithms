I love this shampoo! My hair is dry-ish because I color it and use a flat-iron on it almost every day, so I have to have a moisturizing shampoo and intense conditioner. This is a great shampoo, and I use it with the Shear Splendor conditioning mask. I find the shampoo lathers as well as any moisturizing shampoo (which, because it is moisturizing, is never *quite* as much lather as, say, a clarifying shampoo, but this one does very well). It also smells DIVINE, like a lemon sugar cookie, but not over-powering on the lemon and doesn't smell "baked" like some other cookie and cake-type fragrances. It's just really fresh.
