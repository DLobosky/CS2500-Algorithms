Post-apocalyptic and zombie novels are guilty pleasures of mine. Those who share this interest must admit that there is an incredible amount of terrible work out there. While I appreciate every effort, much is excruciatingly bad (some of the self-published work has not even gone through a spell check). That is why it is great to come across a good zombie effort which can be rare.  Fingerman's book stands out because it followed the basic formula of a small band of survivors, interpersonal conflicts, impersonal and overwhelming siege, along with heroism and cowardice. I love this formula and can read it over and over again. Just give me a disintegrating world where the living are being overwhelmed by the dead and I am a happy zombie-guy. But the author adds new elements to the formula all packaged with legitimate literary skills. The premise, setting, characters, and plot-twist were welcome and fresh. It may attract readers not usually interested in the genre.
