I bought both the Sennheiser HD 201s and HD 202s, with the idea of picking one of them to leave at church for mixing live sound. I bought the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700s a couple weeks ago (were $92 !!! for a day, seem to be ~$112 now) for home use.The 202s ... meh. Tight, earpads are smaller, fit ON my ears (which aren't that big), and uncomfortable compared to the 201s. The 202s seem to have more/louder bass, but maybe the tighter fit is one reason. Lower the bass ~3dB and they sound similar in the bass, and possibly a bit clearer in the mids and highs, but I couldn't imagine wearing them for more than 1/2 hour. I do have a large head, so that might be part of the 'problem'!Bottom line: Unless your head is on the smaller side, and/or you like tight-fitting 'phones, get the 201s instead. They compared pretty well with the AD700s in comfort and sound quality. In fact, if you can swing it, look for the ATH-AD700s to go 'on sale' again and get those! They are actually worth the extra money ...
