This collection contains Steve's hits from the periods in his career - RCA in the early 1980's, MCA in the mid 1980's to early 1990's, and 1990's Arista.  It does not contain his late 1990's stint at Capitol but considering how many hits Steve has had you have to stop somewhere.  Steve is definately one of the very best pop-flavored male country vocalists of them all, kind of a latterday Jim Reeves.  This album contains many number ones and I believe most of them went top ten.  So if you like 80's and 90's country music, a great singer and great songs, Steve Wariner is your guy and this is your CD.
