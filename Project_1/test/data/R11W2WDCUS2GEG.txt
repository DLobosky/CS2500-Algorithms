One could not afford to miss Dr. Richard Kimble in each weekly episode, even more so than Jack Bauer in 24 today.  For four seasons, 120 episodes in all, we hoped that Richard Kimble would find the one-armed man that killed his wife, before Lt. Gerard would capture him.  Look at the many souls he helped along the way!Part two of the August 1967 finale still holds one TV record that has never been broken.  The final episode in 1967 was watched by a phenomenal 72 percent of American homes with television sets at that time!  While both the final episode of MASH in 1983 and the 1980 "Who Shot J.R." episode of Dallas had more viewers in sheer numbers,  the final hour of the Fugitive retains the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a TV finale.Two episodes you cannot miss are The Girl from Little Egypt, which recounts the events of that fateful night when Mrs. Kimble was murdered, and Home is the Hunted, when Dr. Kimble goes home to Indiana to see his family.Television was still a positive influence on our culture in the 1960s, emphasizing moral values.All 30 Season One episodes (1963-1964) are on two DVDs.  I hope they will eventually release all four seasons in the original format.
