It seems to be doing the job; the filters get dirty, but whether it actually does what it purports to do remains to be seen. Allergies are still are problem despite it being run, though not as bad, so maybe it is working.Cons:I didn't like the way the price went up after I had placed it in my cart the day before. Overnight, the price went up. Filters are hard to come by, which should be factored in when deciding whether or not to purchase this item. Note, if you take the filters out and vacuum them thoroughly, their life can be extended three times as long. It's a bit noisy for me to sleep with, so I can only run it in the daytime or at night in other rooms. It doesn't rattle or anything like that, I just can't stand the humming it makes.Pros:It's easy to operate, and the lights tell you when to change the filter. It's light enough to move around from room to room;lighter than a dehumidifier.
