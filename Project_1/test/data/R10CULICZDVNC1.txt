Outperforms the shark in Killzone 3.If you are just running gunning in Call of duty series then yes this is a good buy at this price. Basically this is a version 2 special edition without sixaxis. I'm gonna give it a 3 even though it has no sixaxis.  Full video review is on TEAMGOD.NET site the video is much to large for me to post here or I would have.Pros$39.99 Price tagWorks right out of the box like Version 2 seCons No sixaxis support ===============================================================================THIS LIST WILL CONSTANTLY BE UPDATED!
