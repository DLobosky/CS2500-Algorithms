I really enjoyed these movies when I was younger so I bought this combo for my 7 year old daughter.  She really enjoyed watching them as well.  She really likes the creatures in the movie and all of the fantasy.  I love that they combined the 2 movies in one pack.  It is truly a bonus.  And the price is great.   I would definitely recommend this movie combo for any family who likes fantasy movies.
