The whole first season cost less than these 12 episodes, so save some money and buy the first season Rocko's Modern Life-Season 1Disc-1 1.Carnival knowledge (Rocko and Heffer go to a carnival at the sewage treatment plant) 2.Sand in the navel (While at the beach, Rocko's dog spunky gets swooped up by a pelican.Now Rocko's afraid he's lost him forever) 3.A sucker for the suck-o-matic (Rocko buys a new vacuum cleaner that seems to have a mind of its own) 4.Canned (When Rocko loses his job, he tries out odd jobs before going to an interview at Conglom-o) 5.Rocko's happy sack (Heap-o-food has a 99% off sale and Spunky accidently gets wrapped up and put on sale in the meat case) 6.Flu-in-u-enza (Rocko's got the flu and needs a cure before the championship wrestling match) Disc-2 1.Who's for dinner (Heffer learns the wolves that raised him are not his natural parents)2.Love spanked (Rocko whens a date with Heffer while on the game show"love seat") 3.Clean lovin (Spunky falls in love with the kitchen mop)4.Unbalanced load (Chaos at the laudromat when the grimes try ruining Rocko's lucky shirt)5.Leap frogs (Mrs.Big head invites Rocko over in an attempt to make Ed Bighead jealous)) 6.Bedfellows (Heffer's parents rent out his room so he moves in with Rocko, but quickly overstays his welcome) I hope these dvd sets sell enough for Amazon to quickly offer my other favorites "The rugrats" "Catdog" and "The Angry beavers" season sets...
