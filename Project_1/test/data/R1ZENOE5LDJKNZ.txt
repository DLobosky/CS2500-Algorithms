They produce A LOT of sound for the size of the box. They're not audiophile-grade (unless you bring the volume down and put them up against your nose).  They're very impressive for the size, but they're not a miracle (like so many reviews online will say).  My biggest gripe is all of the over-exaggerated reviews. I personally wish they'd cut down on the bass, and gave it a little more clarity; instead of having try to produce all the bass and garble up mids and highs in the process.SUPPORT IS UNBELIEVABLE:  Jim @ Soundmatters is unbelievably attentive, I have not seen such support from anywhere.  Quick response, and response that are actually directed at you (not the canned "we've received your email, please wait a couple of weeks).   I truely am amazed with how much time they dedicate to their customers.
