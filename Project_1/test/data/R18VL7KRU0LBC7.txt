This is a comical satire on utilitarian precision and propriety : the children rather need more playtime  and more imagination. In short,  they need everything Mary Poppins, the young and charmingly loving witch brought to Bank's children. The film was shot just a few years before The Sound of Music. The rhythm of this film is quite slow and it's more like a play without much settings/background and, it's long. From the today's children's point of view, the scene about bank management board or even the bird-feeding woman may not be very inviting.Having said that, this is still a marvelous movie. Children would like the one man band played by the chimney sweeper. Mary Poppins part was wonderful. Even Mr Bank and his so-called woman-liberalizing wife and or the captain next door are all such a big humour. Yes, there is also the tongue twister...  Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this next to The Sound of Music.
