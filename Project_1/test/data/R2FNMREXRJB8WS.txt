I've used several of these cartridges in my Canon Pixma iP100 and don't see any difference in the print quality or life of these cartridges compared with the much more expensive Canon brand.  Since these cartridges through Amazon are selling for less than 1/2 the cost of the Canon brand, using these cartridges would represent a significant savings over the life of the printer.
