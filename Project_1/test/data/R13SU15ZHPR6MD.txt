Once in a while I would catch reruns when I could years later but I never knew what actually happened since I stopped. Then the show stopped showing reruns and I was missing Sliders again. Until I saw that season 1 & 2 was for $20 (which I got) and then found out 3  was the same. I couldnt resist. If you have never heard of the show. Its about a college student named Quinn Mallory (Jerry O'Connel) his friend who is a girl named Wade Wells (Sabrina Loyd), former 60s-70s singer Rambrant brown (forgor his name) and Prof. Autaro (forgot his name but played Glimii in Lord of the Rings) discover there are altnerate universes where its the same place, time (with one exception) with the same people (sometimes not) but a different road was taken. (Russia won the cold war, england won the American Revolution, etc). They travel to these worlds but cant find their way home, now they must travel to each world until they find theirs without getting killed or trapped in the world.Now there are some issues. The dvd case is cheap looking and at first is hard to master just to open it. Season 3 has 4 discs but in realiaty it has 8. Each disc is double sided which I personally dont like. They should have just had 8 discs. Or try to fit everything onto 4 discs. The special features are very limited. Season 3 has a gag real and episodes of "Earh 2" and another show I never even heard of.Now the reason why I gave this dvd dual pack a perfect score is because regardless or the dvd case, the lack of special features and the the 4x2 discs, this show is great. Each episode is exciting (though some arent as good as others) and intriguing with the what might have been theory.If you loved the show, if you love sci fi, or tv in general get this before they stop doing the dual pack (after you get seasons 1 & 2, then get 4), if you miss out still get it
