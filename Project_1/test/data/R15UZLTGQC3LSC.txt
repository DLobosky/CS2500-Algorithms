Don Juan was their first Vitaphone film, but it only contained music and sound effects. In 1927 Warner adapted the Samson Raphaelson Broadway hit The Jazz Singer into a movie and, this time, they incorporated vocal musical numbers in what was still a silent film for all but twenty minutes. Al Jolson starred as Jakie Rabinowitz, the son of a Jewish cantor. Tradition dictated that he follow in his father's footsteps. However, Jakie preferred to sing jazz. Friction between he and his father over this issue caused Jakie to leave home, change his name to Jack, and become a cabaret performer. When Jack returns years later to visit his parents, he is warmly greeted by his mother (Eugenie Besserer), but is still rejected by his father. Just as Jack is about to break into the big-time career-wise, he is told that his father is dying. Jack misses opening night so he can sing the Kol Nidre at the temple in his father's place. His dying father, in his final moments, hears Jack performing the sacred songs, forgives his son, and dies in peace. Contrary to popular belief, audiences had heard music on film before, and they had heard dialogue on film before. What they had not heard or seen before were either of these things being particularly entertaining. When Jolson sings "Blue Skies" to his mother while adlibbing humorous comments, it all came across as so completely natural that people suddenly realized that sound on film could be entertaining and not just some novelty act.  Despite its many shortcomings, including the predictable storyline, The Jazz Singer was a box-office success.Today, you can best appreciate this movie by putting it in historical context. The best comparison I can make is that it was - although on a much larger scale - the "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" of its day. That 1988 film was also a hit only because of technological achievements that looked wondrous at the time, and today if you see it you will also probably wonder "What was the big deal?". As an aside, the actual first all-talking picture was 1928's "The Lights of New York". If you ever see that film, "The Jazz Singer" looks polished in comparison. In "The Lights of New York", the camera's immobile, the acting's on par with lumber, the script is third-rate, and you have to love that dialogue - "Take.. him... for... A... ride".  I'd love to see a DVD come out with both of these films with some commentary by someone like Robert Osborne on the technology versus art driving the films of that transitional era.
