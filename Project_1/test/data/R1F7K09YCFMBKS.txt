About fifteen years ago I was initiated into kriya yoga by a disciple of Swami Hariharananda, who was authorized to teach by Yogananda. I'd been burning with curiosity about this wonderful method that was extolled but never revealed in any books I could find. Since then, I've learned Marshall Govindan's (very different) method, and have read several books with their own approaches to kriya yoga, which, in the simplest terms, is a method for circulating the prana or energy up and down the spine, from the perineum to the crown of the head in some variations, to the third eye chakra in others, to the bindu in others; while yet other methods circulate the energy up the spine, down the front of the body, stopping at each chakra, and back around kind of like a ferris wheel or, in taoist terms, the microcosmic orbit with stops at each chakra. Preliminary exercises like maha mudra are used, the tongue is kept in khechari mudra, etc., and there are exercises the follow the basic circulation. All this is preliminary to deep meditation rather than being a form of meditation. This book touches on many of these points, and discusses some of the mantras used in the higher levels kriya, and is an interesting if difficult read for someone who has learned the kriya method or methods. The translation is often awkward, with a lot of hindu terms that are not explained. There is no step by step instruction. For the experienced practitioner it makes sense and can be inspiring. But it's not useful for a beginner. If you are a beginner, there's no reason not to buy it for the time when it will make sense, more or less. Keep in mind that the traditional line is that you can learn kriya only from a guru who was authorized by a legitimate guru. There's the rub. Instead of being a tool that unifies various gurus who might differ in their methods, trying to sort out who is teaching the authentic kriya from who isn't is a daunting task. The "my guru is real and your guru's a fraud" sniping is rife. And even Yogananda, who brought the technique west, is accused (with good reason) of teaching a grossly simplified version of it that is still taught by Self Realization Fellowship--grossly simplified it undoubtedly is, but does that mean it's ineffective? The value of a book like this is that in the broadest strokes it provides guidelines about proper practice--proper as prescribed by this author. But the book won't make sense for anyone who hasn't acquired a working knowledge of at least level 1 kriya. For those looking for clear instruction in the actual kriya techniques who have no access to a qualified teacher, I recommend Yogani's book on spinal breathing pranayama, which is very similar to the (simplified) Self-Realization approach minus some of the auxiliary bells and whistles like maha mudra as a preliminary practice; A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya by Saraswati; and his book on Kundalini Tantra Yoga, which is really a very clear manual on kriya yoga as he taught it.
