She works on stomach isolations and glutes.  I'm an intermediate bellydancer and was able to do most of the exercises, and others were challenging, but not discouraging.  The dvd comes with special features which includes a bonus mini workout, a solo performance, a performance by her entire troupe and circle dance.  Her students in the video are very talented and the workout motivates you to get to their level.  Oh, and strangely there is a random part where she talks about her pregnancy.
 I recommend her pilates dvd in addition to this one over this one.
