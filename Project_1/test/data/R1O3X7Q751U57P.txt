But no more!There is good news and it doesn't require you to build your own battery.  I bought the Energizer replacement P511 battery which is has much better amperage (1200mA vs. the Panasonic's 850mA) and uses better battery technology (NiMH vs. NiCad, and NiCad is notorious for memory effect problems).I will post a review of the Energizer on its page, but a quick result is that I now have two phones using the Energizer and both work longer on a charge.  And a surprising difference is that the phone seems to work better at longer distances from the base!  Not sure why (perhaps the extra amperage??) but where I always have had some static using the same phone in the same room, I now have clear reception!  I had been considering ditching these phones altogether, but maybe the new Energizer batteries will forestall that expense!
