That's the good news. The bad news is we'll never know exactly what happened on June 25, 1876, as Utley makes clear in only 145 pages (excluding the bibliography). So, this most authoritative examination of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, is as it must be given the dearth of clear historical record: inconclusive.Utley clearly delineates the controversy surrounding Custer, how the controversy came into being (including the press's role as well as individuals who had interests to promote and protect), and sorts "facts," such as they are, from fictions.It's all quite elusive for those seeking to assign blame to Custer, or to those under Custer who did not deliver support that might have altered the outcome (Major Marcus Reno and Captain Frederick Benteen in particular). And if Utley's scholarship demonstrates one thing, it may be that there is plenty of blame to go around.Utley also examines the role played by the Cheyenne and Sioux, as it should be. For example, they fought where previously they'd fled, and many of the warriors were armed with repeater rifles giving them fire power that was equal to or even superior to Custer's outnumbered and isolated troops.But if the reader thinks things are hazy while examining the extensive historical records accumulated through the years by white society, prepare to enter the ghost land of how the Cheyenne and Sioux tracked history. Their's is a realm of myth and creative story telling from the parallel universe of the people who originally populated the great expanse of the plains.In all of this, there is one question I think should be further examined in some detail: just how wise was it for Custer to divide his much smaller force multiple times without a clear plan of attack. As Robert E. Lee demonstrated less than 20 years prior to Little Bighorn, dividing a smaller force against a superior opponent could work, if well planned and executed. Before Lee and his cohorts divided their forces, they knew the land, the enemy's strength and position, and how the leadership of the opponent was likely to react. And even then there was great risk in dividing the smaller force once.But on June 25, 1876, it seems to me, Custer divided his force multiple times without understanding the geography, the size of the enemy, their firepower, or an understanding of how they might react to being attacked. Further, Custer's relations with his subordinates, particularly Reno and Benteen were not exactly harmonious and a wiser officer might have developed a different strategy that included keeping close contact with the "enemy" until better conditions could be achieved, or until reinforcements arrived - just saying.For readers more interested in the same history in the hands of better story tellers, I would recommend in this order: A Terrible Glory, by James Donovan; or The Last Stand, by Nathaniel Philbrick. For those comfortable in sorting through an inconclusive body of evidence, I would start with Utley's Custer and the Great Controversy before moving on to Donovan's and Philbrick's offerings.
