This valuable little book, at approximately 6-1/2 by 5 inches, packs a lot of information and pleasure into a little package.  Five hundred artists, from Agasse to Zurbaran, are represented.  Each painter or sculptor gets one page that features a full-color print (covering about two-thirds of the page); a paragraph of text that discusses the artist's work in general, the specific work depicted, and cross-references to similar artists; information about the artist and the piece, including the artist's place and year of birth and death, the work's title, date, medium/materials, physical dimensions and current location.Presented alphabetically, rather than chronologically, this dynamic little tome makes great browsing, and helps you to look at art in a way we don't usually -- outside of its historical context.  The paper and color plates are of the first quality and the text is informative.  It's fun to see which work was chosen as typical of your favorite artists, and it's fun to try and guess the period in which an artist worked before you read the information.Because so much is fit into such a small volume, some readers may be frustrated at the small print, though the font is quite clean.  The book closes with glossaries of technical terms and artistic movements and a directory of museums and galleries, organized by country, that includes address, phone number and a list of the book's works that they own.  (Maybe the next edition will also include web sites?)Phaidon Press has done you a service by publishing this pithy treasure.  Buy it now!
