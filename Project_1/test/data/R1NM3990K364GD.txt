I loved the E2's and as expected the E3 were  even better--with more definition at all frequencies and sound levels. Earbuds (or plugs) definitely have some sweet fit spots to get optimal bass and avoid some tinniness that you can hear when they are not inserted or sitting correctly in your ear.  Shure provides a number of ear plug options to help everyone find something they like. Now, I have compared the E3, the SE420, and my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones sitting in the rear of a jet while traveling (next to the engine). The less expensive E3 beat out the Bose headphones with better high and middle end definition and equivalent outside sound isolation. The Bose headphones have a bit better low end.. but nothing is bone shaking with earphones or headphones anyway.  I almost think that the Bose headphones seem muddy in the mid and upper end after listening to the E3 and SE420.   The SE420, in my opinion has a richer sounding mid end then the E3, while handily beating the Bose headphones.  I think that the bass and most of the high end frequencies are about the same in the E3 and SE420--maybe pushing your budget to purchase the E3 or equivalent... since the E3 cost $179 or so, and the SE420 cost $350. As for Shure customer service--I had a suspected loose wire in one of the E3 earphones (used for 8 months) leading to dropouts when I would move my head. I got a return form off the Shure website--filled it out and sent it along with a copy of my receipt to Shure. Within 10 days, they had sent out a completely new pair at no charge. THAT is great service. In the meantime I purchased the SE420's while I was waiting for my E3 "repair". I just had to have another pair and my budget could tolerate a higher price point.I understand why price does come into some consideration on rating, and $350 (at an Apple retail store) is pretty high end for earphones, but considering these SE420's sound better (to me) than the E3--I am only rating sound quality.  With price considered, the SE420 would probably only get a 4, simply because the E3 is a great value.I would recommend the entire line of Shure earphones, buying whichever one best fits your budget.
