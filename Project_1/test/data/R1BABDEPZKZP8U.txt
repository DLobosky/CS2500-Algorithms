The price is the best I could find anywhere on the internet, and I was so glad to be able to get my hubby multiple pairs. The nylon type pajamas are his favorite, as they are so comfy and don't get "hung up" on the sheets when he turns over.It really made my day to not only find quality nylon pajamas for him but to get them for such a good price!
