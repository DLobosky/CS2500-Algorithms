That feeling didn't last very long. Once I got past the first several levels, the game got more and more challenging as more and more customers and food options are added with each level. I probably have a little more difficulty than some, as I play on my laptop using a touch pad instead of using a mouse. I think it might be a smidge easier with a mouse, as you have to move very, very fast to keep your customers happy.This game is very addicting. When I first downloaded the game, I told myself I was only going to play for 15 minutes or so. The next thing I know, it's an hour later!  I just kept saying, 1 more level, 1 more level. LOL.The goal of the game is to prepare your customers' orders and serve them quickly enough that they don't get frustrated and walk out and so you get paid and get a good tip.  Each level has a money goal that you need to reach to pass that level. And with each new level, you are asked to choose something new to add to the game-- usually this is an additional food or beverage option, but sometimes it's a power-up to help you along.When you first start the game, there is a short, but very good tutorial you do to show you how to prepare the different items your customers might order.  Basically, the different food items and containers roll out on a conveyor belt. You have to click on the items to grab them. You then either bring the container over to the appropriate machine to fill it (i.e. soda machine for soda, ice cream machine for ice cream, fry machine for fries) or assemble the sandwich (burger, bun, lettuce, etc). When and item is complete, you right-mouse click and it will be auto-delivered to the customer. When you have completed a customer's order, they pay you and tip you (if they are happy). The game is not difficult to understand, but it can be a challenge to complete all those orders quickly enough.The game has several different modes to play in, but when you first start playing, you can only play Story Mode.  This is "timed" in that customers lose patience if you take too long.  Once you have played enough, you unlock a Relax mode and a Challenge Mode.  There is also an Expert Story mode, but I have not unlocked that one yet.I am running this game on Window 7 and have had no problems so far.All in all, this is a fun way to kill some time (probably more than you want to).
