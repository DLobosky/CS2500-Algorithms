I don't even mind the bird droppings on one shot, that could have used some clearasil; and that's the kind of stuff that the hard core Trekkers have aneurysms about. For me, the set was very satisfying including the box. Restored Khan or DNR'd; all episodes reached the same goal. A great upgrade from DVD and a chance to enjoy the original cuts, which were good enough. I never did get a big charge from the Directors Cut of TMP other than an occasional, 'look at that'. The first one is fresh as always.There is a great dissent about this set because it has not been 'restored to the max' and there are moments that could use it  BUT... It would be a great mistake to avoid this set in favor of a future upgrade. There will be one; but not as soon as many  think. There was much work done to make all these films look as good as possible for now! And they look and sound 'state of the art' within limitations. Better that most films from this period or later. Try it; you'll like it!
