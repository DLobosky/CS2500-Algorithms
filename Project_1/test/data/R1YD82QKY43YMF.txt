I have read over two dozens books on complexity science and its applications to organizations of all types.  Clearly, The Soul At Work is the best of those books.  If you already know something about complexity  science and its business applications and want to learn more or simply want  to get started on the subject, this is the book you should read.  Here's  why.  First, the authors are very fine writers.  They also seem to have had  outstanding editing.  The book is by far the best written of any that I  have read on this subject, and is among the best written of any business  books I have read as well.  This quality particularly shows up in  clarifying ideas that can be hard to grasp (complexity science), explaining  very interesting examples, and connecting the ideas to the examples in very  useful ways.  Second, most of the examples are fresh, so you will learn  something new by reading these cases.  Most business books choose the same  examples over and over (do IBM and Coca-Cola seem familiar?), and it gets a  little tiring for the reader.  The one example in The Soul at Work that I  was familiar with was Verifone, and the authors developed lots of new  material there that substantially added to my understanding.  Third, the  cases have a lot of variety in them (as to type of organization, size of  organization, the people profiled, the cultural background of the  organization, and so forth) which provides a multidimensional perspective  that is very helpful.  Fourth, the authors successfully contrast their  ideas with the humanistic approach to management and the engineering  approach, which is a useful backdrop for understanding what they have to  say.  Anyone who does prefer the humanistic approach will like this book,  and will get many new ideas for employing that direction.  Fifth, and most  importantly, the central theme of the book rings very true to me based on  my over 30 years of consulting experience with organizations of all kinds.   Trust-based relationships are an essential element of how organizations  become more effective.  Improve the trust, and any organization works  better.  The main reason is that trust helps overcome the stalls of poor  communication, procrastination, bureaucracy, tradition, disbelief, and  avoiding unattractiveness.  Although others have made this point, The Soul  at Work makes the point better.  If you think about the new  electronically-connected world, you can see that its main limitation is  establishing trust before we can each feel comfortable extending ourselves  and our connections in new directions.  If you only read one business book  this year, this is my recommendation.  It's the best business book I have  read since The Living Company by Arie de Geus.
