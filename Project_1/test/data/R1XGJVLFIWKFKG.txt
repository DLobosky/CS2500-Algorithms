Halloween H20 was a great way to close the series. Salutes and tributes to horror were all over the film with scenes referencing scenes from the original film (the sightings out the window in the middle of class) to icon cameos (Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis's mother/Psycho star) and the return of I&II's chain smoking nurse) to an opening tribute to Donald Pleasance via a voice over of classic lines from Halloween I.Also good casting which became few are far between at the sequel attempts after Halloween II (Josh Harnett became a super heartthrob and Michelle Williams recently garnered an Academy Award nonination).Just trust me when I say, buy Halloween , Halloween II and this film. Great acting and great rich story. Pretend the rest never  existed.
