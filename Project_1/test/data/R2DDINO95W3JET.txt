Each one is so different, yet so powerfully conveyed and authoritative that to be without either one you are doing yourself a disservice.The Keilberth is very expensive. I do, however, recommend that above any other version because it is the finest overall ring cycle availble, Kind of a mix between the Krauss and KNA but in stereo sound. To put it bluntly--The Keilberth is probably the best, but I enjoy Krauss the most-if that makes any senses. The Krauss can be had for as little as 40 dollars, as can the KNA be had at a reasonable cost. Hans Hotter should be judged by this performance(definetly not Soltis), because for me it is his finest Wotan and the finest Wotan on record. His Wanderer is without peer. If the Krauss is the intense one, then this can be considered the meditative ring-though of course that is very broad and does not reflect the entire perforamance(as the wanderer seen alone will attest to. The Keilberth can be considered a mixture of the two, but in stereo soundAstrid Varnay, not Nilsson, is the greatest Brunnhilde on record, period. Hers is a complete interpretation, with a voice that can reach both the highest and lowest, both tender and vengeful, moments with a convinction not found anywhere else from anyone(including Nilsson, who despite a tremendous performance seems to always show off the steel in her voice(and yes, she can produce a more beautiful sound that Varnay, but is that really who Brunnhidle is?)The other cast is also just as remarkable. Need I even discuss the merits of Griendl, Niedlinger, Suthaus, Browenstejin, and Windgassen. Windgassen is marvelous here, again, his Keilberth performance is his only rival on disc.It is funny that is true for most of this. Its only rivals are Krauss and Keilberth-come on guys and gals, the furtwangler isnt that great-despite the VPO Die walkure.Despite all the praise, if you are new to Wagner, you may not be ready for historical recordings yet and will probably be overly sensitive to the sound(but you must eventually see past that or you will miss out on the greatest recordings ever, but it understandly takes time). If you are new to this, go for Barenboim. Tomlison is probably the finest Wotan after these three recordings(Hotter is past his prime for Solti). If you are a newbie and you have the cash to spend-go for the Keilberth-it really encompasses all you will ever need with the greatest Brunnhilde performance ever, the second greatest Wotan performance(Hotter to himself here), the greatest Siegfried performance ever(Windgassen) and it is in stereo sound.
