It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this book. It was the first comprehensive popular history of Nazi Germany to appear in English, and it is probably more responsible than any other single source for  shaping the way that Americans think about Nazi Germany, World War II, and  the Holocaust. More than that, this is an estimable work of history. Shirer  has done an admirable job of combing through the mountains of primary  source material that the Nazis left behind and assembling a coherent and  comprehensible narrative from it.Of course, it would be a mistake to  view this book as simply or even primarily a work of history. It is  intended as an indictment of the evil and barbarity that the Nazis  perpetrated in Germany and across Europe for more than twelve years and as  an indictment of the men and women in Germany, in France, in Great Britain,  and elsewhere who allowed that evil and barbarity to occur. Shirer is not  content to point out that Hitler and Himmler and Goering and Frank were  monsters; he also is intent on showing how complicit the German Army and  the German people were in what happened and how the ignorance, stupidity,  and cowardice of the politicians of the West and the Soviet Union actively  assisted Hitler's monstosities in coming to pass.The reader can almost  visualize Shirer shaking in outrage when he considers the evil Hitler  wrought with the help of the rest of Europe. This outrage is, in many ways,  both the book's greatest asset and its greatest shortcoming. While Shirer's  indignation makes this a great moral work, it also causes him to be more  than a little unfair to some of his subjects and to present the history as  being more one-dimensional than it in fact was. Shirer never tells, for  example, that one of the principal reasons that Chamberlain and Daladier  were willing to appease Hitler was that the Depression had bankrupted both  Britain and France. They believed that they could not afford to rearm so  that they could stop Hitler militarily, and so they sought to get the best  deals they could at the bargaining table. Their policy was, of course,  dangerously short-sighted, but it is unfair to both men to suggest that  their policy was almost solely the result of cowardice. Then, too, is  the fact that Shirer almost invariably describes Rosenberg as a befuddled  dolt, Goering as fat, and Ribbentrop as vacuous. It is readily apparent to  the reader that he does so because he feels he must constantly reiterate  their lack of praiseworthiness, but it is disconcerting to the reader. I am  at a loss to explain what Goering's girth has to do with anything, or what  it was about Rosenberg's writing that made him any stupider that most  Nazis. While I believe that Ribbentrop deserves almost all of the calumny  that can be heaped on him, Shirer never makes a real case for his  vacuity.Finally, it must be said that Shirer appears to run out of steam  towards the end of the book. All of World War II is covered in the last 25%  of the book, and many important topics, including the Holocaust, get short  shrift as a result.These criticisms should not be taken to mean that I  believe that this book is not meritorious or that it should not be read. On  the contrary: one would be hard-pressed to find a better, more  comprehensible, more accessible one volume book about Nazi Germany. It  ought to be the starting point (but not the ending point) for anyone  interested in World War II or Nazi Germany.
