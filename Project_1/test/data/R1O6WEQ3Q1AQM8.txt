Now a D5 is triangular, if it lands on it's side then it is the number in the top corner which are read and if it lands on it's face it is the number on the face which are facing up that are read. I think the Gamescience D5 works fairly well to generate a random number. he dice is a bit more likely to land on the sides than on the faces but generally this works quite well.The coloring of this dice is quite vibrant. Mine have silvery instead of white numbering so it might be a slightly different model however the red in these ruby colored dice is excellent, so much that I am considering buying two more and make them into earrings. The numbers are easy to read and the dice itself is quite durable. Now some Gamescience dice have a fading problem with the numbers over time. I have not had my ruby D5 long enough to know if this is a problem, but I have had a blue D5 for years and it have not faded. If the marking fades however you can just use a pen or some paint in the desired color and re mark it. My dice arrived with a slight irregularity to one corner, I have however many Gamescience dice and this is the only one with such a fault so I think this is only on my dice and not a common thing with the ruby D5.Now how can you use this dice? I find that D5 has more uses than many odd numbered dice. I play allot of World of Darkness and Ars Magica and I find it useful to be able to generate a number from 2 to 10 as in both games 1 do something special and in some instances the option for that is not rolled with. Also in many games a D5 roll is called for, normally you would then use a D10 and half it, but here you do not have to. I have used my D5 dice in play several times so it is useful unlike many other oddly numbered dice which is mostly for collection purposed. All in all this is a nice little dice, and it is the perfect gift for the gamer who have everything.
