I purchased an LG 32550 TV (LG 32LD550 32-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Internet Applications) and I was so excited to get home and get this installed. I ordered this expensive little adapter as required and recommended, and I am so sorry I did.I use a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router (D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router) that is excellent for broadcasting to every room in our house except for our master bedroom. We have an older block house, with our bedroom being farthest from the omni-directional antennas. Honestly, we have tried everything to get this TV to work in our bedroom!So this doesn't happen to anyone else...I want you to  know I tried initially just to use the LG Wireless Adapter (LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi USB Adaptor), then I bought an extension for it (AmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters)) to get it out from behind the TV and able to receive a signal better (which helped, but Netflix movies kept dropping), and then I tried installing a new antenna (Alfa 9dBi SMA OMNI-Directional High-Gain Screw-On Swivel Antenna for Linksys - WET54G, WET54GS, WMP54G, WET11, WRV54G, WMP11 PCI Card, WPS11, WRT54GC also for Netgear - FM114P, FVM318, FWG114P, MA311, ME101, ME103, WG302, WG311 and WG311T) but that never really helped. Finally I found heaven in a box with this little bridge like router device Cisco-Linksys WET610N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapter. It's compatible with my Draft N protocol and it zips right through all LG's online resources, specially helping us watch movies and TV shows on Netflix without any broadcasting or synchronizing or downloading issues.I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SIMPLY GET THE CISCO LINKSYS DUAL-BAND WIRELESS ADAPTER!I am happy as a clam now!
