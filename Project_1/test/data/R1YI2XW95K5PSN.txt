recently i came into some money and did something i always wanted to do. i bought 2 pairs of high quality headphones. these, and the open back grado 325is. i felt that they would compliment each other nicely with different traits; these are closed the grados are open, these are over the ear the grados are not, and from what i gathered these were warm sounding and full, ideal for extended playback - while the grados had a rather unique classic sound with very good seperation and soundstage. these are about $200 more than the grados, so i naturally had higher standards, and for a long time i have been after a pair of good denons.straight out of the box, these were beautiful. they are super super comfortable, and feel very solid and well made(though with such an expensive pair of cans i am always nervous when using them, especially because of the pivoted ear cups). the sound.... oh my god, the sound.... they may not be the most accurate from a technical perspective, im sure if you go into the physics and graphs, these are not the best, and i will also acknowledge that i have not listened to any cans more expensive than these.... but compared to high end cans like sennheiser hd650, beyerdynamic990, grado325is, and then all the sony/jvc etc (not to mention those crappy 'bos&eacute;'/monster beats) these are the most tonal, inviting, warm, and natural sounding headphones i have experienced.... they are a masterpiece, well done denon.i am not going to go into any of my audio tests or comparisons on these, its all unnecessary, i did not fall in love with these headphones because they are the most representative, transparent, or accurate (though they may well be).... all that matters is that when i put them on through my amp and turn "lift your skinny fists" or "in rainbows" up high, these headphones melt me in a way that no others do. they are at least as enjoyable as my genelec 8040 active speakers, and dare i say they even compete with my modded AR-2As? and in a way that doesnt have my neighbor hitting my walls with a broomstick. if you really want to they can be pushed fine by an mp3player/phone/laptop (though really, dont buy these if thats all your going to use them for). if i am really nitpicking, i will admit to being slightly disappointed with the mahogony finish - i was hoping they would be more interesting than the block red you see in the online images - but dont spend this much on headphones just because you like the look. i am happy with both of my purchases, i get a lot of use from both these and the grados, and i am confident i made the right choices for the money - the grados have slightly better separation and soundstage, but are more fatiguing because of it.... but when i just want to lean back and chill out to some music without getting all nerdy and technical, these are definitely my goto headphones. these sound a lot more *real* - and when i listen to something like prokofiev, in lossless, i can close my eyes and almost believe i am hearing it live. and i know it sounds corny, but its not just the sound, its the experience, and these give me a special feeling EVERYTIME i use them. if you think its stupid to spend this much on headphones, then i can see your point - dont buy them. but if you care about listening to music enough to consider these, then you will not be dissapointed.
