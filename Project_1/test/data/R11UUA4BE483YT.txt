It measures at 234,000 scoville units (compared to 120,000 in Beyond Insanity).This is where Da Bomb starts to seperate the chili-heads from the rest. Like all of the Da Bomb sauces this one has a VERY nice pipe-tobacco-like smell. Ground Zero has a nice fruity pineapple smell to it as well. Taste is similar. Like Beyond Insanity this one is very thick so its easy to accidently drop a bit more then intended on your food. Da Bomb sauces provide a unique burn because the burn takes a LOOONG time to really peak so it's easy to accidently eat too much... be careful!If you have experience with extreme hot sauces then by all means pick this up. If you are new to extreme hot sauce then I would probably start with Beyond Insanity... it's still quite hot.
