I was eager to dive into The Lightkeeper's Ball because of this and the fact that the cover was just so beautiful! I began the book at breakfast and finished it before dinner. For those who know me, that obviously means it was unputdownable and, in consequence, an amazingly awesome story! Loved it! The characters in this book are very believable and three-dimensional. Olivia was spunky and brave and I connected with her almost from the very first few pages. She reminded me of myself. Harrison was great as well. It took me a little while to warm up to him--I felt like I was in Olivia's shoes, not sure if he was good or bad--but once I got to know him he became a great hero for this story. It was also neat seeing characters from the two previous books in here. While I haven't read either book, I still recognized character names like Katie, Will, and Addie. It made me want to go back and read the other books so I could get to know them better. When I first began this book, I thought I knew how it was all going to go. Pretty girl goes to find her sister's murderer--falls in love with her top suspect--finds real murderer who is not her new love--couple live happily ever after. The end. Right? Wow, was I wrong! Colleen threw in dozens of twists and surprises along the way until I gave up trying to predict how the plot would go. Always a great sign that you are reading an awesome book by a talented author. I commend Colleen for her ability to surprise her readers.I easily dived into the lives of Olivia and Harrison through Colleen's vivid writing voice. A few times, during an action scene, I felt that things were told to the reader more than showed. But after getting into the story I didn't even notice it, I was so wrapped up in the story. While there is nothing wrong ever described, this book does deal with a husband cheating with another woman and an unfaithful fianc&eacute;e. Besides stating these facts, it doesn't go into too much detail and I never became uncomfortable. A man and woman do get stranded in the forest for two days, but nothing wrong happens besides that they end up sleeping beside each other when they are finally rescued and therefore gives a bad impression to their rescuers. This situation was necessary for the plot and Colleen handed the situation so well that I had no problem with it.In closing, I loved this book--the cover, the characters, the plot...everything! Colleen did a fabulous job and I will most assuredly be keeping my eye out for more of her work in the future. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an awesome historical that has mystery, suspense, danger, love, intrigue, and deception all rolled into one book!I reviewed this book for FIRST Wild Card Blog Tours.
