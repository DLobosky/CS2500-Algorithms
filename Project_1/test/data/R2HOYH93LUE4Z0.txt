I will refrain from any comments regarding the nature of the translation, leaving that for those far more learned than myself.I have downloaded several Kindle versions of the Holy Bible and have found this one to be the most well thought out in terms of Kindle navigation.One of the few problems I have had with the Kindle is selecting specific lines of text with the cursor which moves up and down the right side of the reading pane.  If the text is located in the center of the page (Holy Bible, New International Version, NIV Kindle Edition by International Bible Society), or worse, justified left (Holy Bible, King James Version KJV Kindle Edition by Olive Tree Bible Software), then it is sometimes difficult to line up the cursor with the book you wish to jump to.This is the first edition I've had experience with that justifies the Table of Contents to the right, next to the cursor, so it is easy to select a particular line.  I also really like the fact that after selecting a particular book, you are immediately taken to a sub menu listing the individual chapters, also justified right.The verse numbers are set slightly above the text when you actually reach text for continued simplicity in navigation.For me, this is the best set-up for Kindle versions of Holy Scripture and after a little practice, I have been able to look up verses faster than I am able to do with an actual book.  I specifically recommend this version for those looking for a "Kindle Friendly" version of the Holy Bible and especially to those who are looking for a NASB version.
