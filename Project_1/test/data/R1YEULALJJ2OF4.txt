I must note that I have small ear holes and find a lot of earphones out there become irritating after awhile but these can sit fine.  The sound is pretty good.  the mids and highs are very good and clear.  the bass is not so good.  if you have an equalizer, you'll definitely be doing a bass enhancement.  after you pump up the bass, these earphones sound great.  the cord comes somewhat wrinkled due to the way they packaged it.  kind of annoying since it's like wearing a wrinkled shirt.  the cord length is acceptable.  it comes with another pair of ear pieces if you find the default ones too small.  the design is minimalistic, bordering on ugly.  even the packaging is ugly (just a clear plastic box.  but sound and comfort are the most important things and this one excels (except for lack of bass).I'll compare the JVC to the other recently bought Panasonic ones.  The Panasonic earphones were almost twice as expensive.  They look really nice and are probably the most comfortable earphones you'll ever where.  It's a weird design but it works.  If I was solely picking comfort, it would definitely be the Panasonic.  The sound however is mixed.  It sounds somewhat muddled.  For the Panasonic, I actually had to do a treble enhancement.  If I had to pick solely on sound, I would lean toward the much cheaper JVC.  The Panasonic comes with a straight and very long cord which is a great feature.  It also has a drawstring pouch.honestly, I wish I had the JVC sound in the Panasonic packaging.  But it'd be hard to find earphones of similar sound quality to the JVC for $10.
