I loved my Treo 650 despite the well-known audio problems that arise, so I expected something equivalent to the 650 when I upgraded. But what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life. I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled and every "trick" Palm and other users suggest to extend battery performance is utilized. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and they have made it next to impossible to reach them to complain about this, you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper "smartphone" on the market recently. Sorry Palm, I loved you for the Treo 650 and was willing to live with some glitches, but a horrible battery life on the 680 is not something easy to tolerate.  So all I can say is pretty "stupid" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before planning to exit the "smartphone" market? [Despite the prior reviews on this page that were so glowing, anyone who is doubtful of my complaint on battery life, or think that its isolated to just a defective phone here and there, I suggest that you please do a search on the internet before buying this phone, and read the numerous blogs out there on this very same complaint!)P.S.: search under these words exactly on Amazon: "palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked)" to read other reviews of this phone stating similar battery life complaints. Whether locked (meaning tied to any one company like Verizon or Cingular) or not, a Palm Treo 680 is still the same Palm product.
