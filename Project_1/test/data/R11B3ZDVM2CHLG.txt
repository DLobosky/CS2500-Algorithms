Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.I don't want to be blunt but there doesn't seem to be that much to the main plot of this mystery.  Hercule Poirot's (David Suchet) dentist Henry Morley (Laurence Harrington) commits suicide while on the job.  All the people who were his patients (including Poirot) that morning when dentist Morley was found dead said that he was quite well when he treated them.  So when exactly did he die?   Naturally, the great sleuth investigates and he banks on the investigative skills of Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) to aid in the investigation.  Two more of the dentist's patients are eventually killed.As Poirot says, the clue to solving this case "began with a shoe."The major people considered in Poirot's investigation are as follows:1. Mr. Amberioth, one of the dental patients (Kervork Malikyan)2. Former actress Miss Mabelle Sansbury-Seale and another dental patient  (Carolyn Colqumoun) 3. Banker Allister Blunt and yet another dental patient (Peter Blythe)4. Helen, Blunt's secretary (Joanne Phillips-Lane)5. Gladys Neville, Morley's dental assistant (Karen Gledhill)6. Frank Carter, Gladys' boyfriend  (Chris Eccleston)7. Alfred Biggs, Morley's pageboy (Joe Greco)8. Julia Olivera, Blunt's sister-in-law (Helen Horton)9. Jane Olivera, Julia's daughter (Sara Stewart)Of all the actors mentioned above, Suchet's performance stands out.  He does a stellar job in depicting the super sleuth (as usual).  Also the actress who portrayed Miss Mabelle Sansbury-Seale did a good job.This movie compared to the others in this series has less humor in it.  However, the mystery is much more complex and intriguing.  Also, this particular movie began with a slow motion sequence of kids playing hopscotch.  I found this interesting.The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.  The costumes are authentic looking.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.Finally, the DVD (which has the movie is full screen format) has five extras.  Of these, the ones that had the Poirot trivia and quotes were the most interesting for me.In conclusion, this is a fun movie, even if you have read the novel!!(1992; made for TV; 100 min; British drama; 10 scenes; color.)+++++
