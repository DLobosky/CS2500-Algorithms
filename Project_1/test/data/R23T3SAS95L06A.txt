Beside this one, I also own Gigabyte Geforce 460 and Gigabyte GeForce 9800 GT, which are installed in different computer and still in use up to this date. This 670 is build solid, massive card, massive heatsink and the 3 fans deal with heat generate by the card without any issue, runs very quite considering the size of it. Highly recommend, I never had any issue with any of my Gigabyte products. Installed the newest drivers from NVidia webpage and was good to go, passed 48 hours system burn  in test under heavy load without any issuesSystem Specs:CPU: I7 3930K overclocked @ 4.8GHZCooler Master TPC 812 with Dual Fan / push-pullMotherboard: Asus P9X79 WSVideo Card: Gigabyte Nvidia GTX 670 GV-N670OC-2GDRam: 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR3 1866 @ Timing: 9-10-9-27HD: Samsung 830 256 GB SSD (OS), Western Digital Caviar Black 2 TB SATA III 7200 RPM (Data)DVD Drives: LITE-ON 12X BD-R, ASUS 24X DVD-RCase: Cooler Master HAF X RC-942-KKN1 Black SteelMonitors: Samsung 24"1080p, Asus 24" 1080p, Dell 22" 1080p
