I have been very disappointed with the reviews of this movie until I saw it, and then I understood!! It is a movie that you either love or hate and there seems to be no middle ground. Some have said it is too long, the story line is bad, the special effects are lackluster, and only Osment and Law are good. They are probably right, what do I know. I am a movie buff, but hey, I liked - Gone With The Wind - How The West Was Won - To Kill A Mockingbird and hated Citizen Kane. So for what it is worth here is how it affected me. I was quickly pulled into the story and found it a journey very much like the Wizard of Oz and other quests to find our true identity. In this world of possible cloning of human beings and other life, I found the story plausible, but most of all associated with the overall theme of the piece, which I saw not only to be a quest for identity, but love. To me, the movie presented how much love can move our world and more important can move us as human beings, even if we appear to be robots. There are many portrayed in this movie that lack love. The parents, the boy robots maker, the overall outside world. Also, there is another theme, no less important. Not being loveable because you are different. So as these themes emerged this movie more and more held my attention. Then came homelessness. Few assoicate with that, and of those who watch this movie, I would wager to say, they have never been homeless. Then there is seperation and lonliness and fear, and the overiding desire to be like others so we can be loved in return. People have slept through this movie, and I would imagaine those same people sleep through life. None of the above is really important because we have become too self-sufficient to see a need for each other, to feel the loving touch of another, and to be nurtured by another, and most of all, to return the love we are given. We were all hit September 11th and taken down in a great way by our own technology, as are the people in this story. For a while we banded together and love on the streets, to the homeless, to the lonely became important. Now we are back and it is ok to hate again. Ok, to pull others apart as the robots are pulled apart in this movie. But not all. There are still heros. There are still people who reach out, and there are still those for whom the words - I love you - are the most important words in the world. To me, that is what this movie is about. That is what not only this boy robot wants, but we all do, if we stop to admit it. For awhile we did. For awhile we gave it in great abundance. For this movie, most of these loving people do not show up until 2,000 years after our species have gone. So I cried in this movie, more than any other. I cried for the boy who wanted to be loved, and wanted to give love. I cried for the robots who were created different and brought into a society that only sought to destroy them. I cried for the teddy bear who followed along faithfully and asked nothing, only to stay around, and I cried for a society that sometimes pushes love away, or sadly, never reaches for it at all. But hey, what do I know - my all time favorite movie is - To Kill A Mockinbird - it says a lot about love, a lot about being different and a lot about hatred. I put this movie along side it and hope that one day it gets the recognition it deserves. Tall order, but not an artifical one.Just for the record - also thought the special effects were great. The sound wonderful, the score good, and the DVD picture at times breathtaking.
