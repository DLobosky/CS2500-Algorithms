My wife, a registered clinical dietician and a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE), had me on a low fat diet &quot;American Heart Association&quot; diet for years. I kept gaining weight. We read the different low carb books and I decided, with her help, to try the South Beach Diet because it includes moderate fruits. She agreed I should try it, perhaps she had grown embarrassed because I was so heavy given her profession.Week 4.In the first phase, which I had been on for 3 weeks, I have dropped 6% of my total body weight. I seem to have leveled off for the last week as I have begun to add more things back. This is what the book predicts. I had a BMI of 32.5 and now have a BMI of 30.6. I will go back into the strict phase soon to push that even lower. I am targeting less than 25. I include 30 min of exercise per day. The best news is that at no time have I felt deprived.A significant item in the book is the suggestion to add a sugar-free fiber supplement. I highly recommend this as well. It has made this diet very tolerable, plus adds to my satiety. My wife is now a quiet, but enthusiastic believer in this type of approach.Thumbs up Dr. Agatston, this plan works.
