It's good to see how things should be done at a expert level. However, as a beginner, I think a few more instructions would have been welcome.For example, a full split is shown, but no modified or beginner level adjustments were offered. I, for one, can't picture myself in that full split and I have 15 years tai chi experience. Most of the kicks and punches were shown at full speed and full power. Movements done repeatedly and at a greatly reduced speed would have been helpful.I practice with a Xing-Yi, Bagua teacher who once was a Shaolin coach and many of these kicks and punches are used in his classes. As stated in the DVD, the Southern and Northern styles were integrated somewhat after the training halls were reopened in later years. We practice each kick about 10 times in each class, three times a week. Master Zhou says that beginning Wudang training consists of 30 kicks on each side, in each set, done in sets of three  everyday. That is why his form and power are so beautiful to watch. If that is beginning training, what is advanced?The DVD is very clear and easy to view. The narrator speaks in a nicely paced voice. Opening chapter tells a little about the history of Wudang Mountains and the monks who trained there. I for one, did not know that Wudang is the tallest peak in the range and points to Heaven. All other mountains in the chain lean in and point to Wudang.We are told to warm up each and every time we begin a session and to rest if it becomes too intense. Master Zhou repeats that several times during the film. If we are not warmed up, injury will occur. He even states that stances and punches and kicks can be boring and hard to do for a long time, but we must practice them correctly before learning the form.Clear instruction is given for the warm ups, punching, kicking and form work. Applications are also shown for each move. The insert in the DVD case lists the sequence of the form.This DVD is a five star product, but I feel the skill level is off the mark. It is High Level work done by High Level instructors and a must for any serious internal arts practitioner of the Wudang style.
