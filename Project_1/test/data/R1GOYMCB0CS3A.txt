It's frankly an eye openner and really does a great job at resetting what was really going on.Basically Japan had 80million people.  Europe (Britain, France, Netherlands, Spain and the US had a bunch of colonies in Southeast Asia and basically European intervention in the area along with Japanese industrialization was putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the Japanese.I was extremely pleased with this balanced and very comprehensive approach the author took with respect to the political aspects that led to the War and how the war was conducted.This book is extremely readable to a layperson.  Not only the war is detailed but the high politics that led up to the war and during the conduct of the war are also meticulously detailed.I can't say enough great things about this work.  I'm a long-time student of the War in the Pacific during WWII and this book is a wonderful view into that world.
