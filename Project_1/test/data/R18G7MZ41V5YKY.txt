Pirates: DMC is a potentially great movie undone by excess. Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.  But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too much action at the expense of story; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about undead pirates on a ghost ship) and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the first movie' mindset.  Maybe Disney was so surprised by the first movie's box office that they rushed to capitalize on its success and didn't give this one the care and feeding it needed to be a box office champ AND a great movie.  Trust me, I wanted to love this movie but after a while I found myself looking at my watch (never a good sign) and getting restless despite the non-stop action.  Good movie but had the potential to be a lot more........
