I'm the family geek so I get tech support calls from my in-laws and I'm glad to help.  The last call I got was from my mother-in-law and her year old Dell laptop was booting intermittently.  We decided the best thing was to get a new hard drive.I was dreading spending the time to re-install all her programs from scratch so I decided to get this docking station along with the new drive and try cloning the existing drive.Luckily the old drive ran long enough to run Acronis True Image on it and the docking station worked great for this purpose.  I was doing the procedure over USB and it was fine.I plugged the new drive into the laptop and you couldn't tell the difference, except there was more drive space.I got this model on purpose because it has eSATA as well as USB. My plans are to get an eSATA card for my laptop and use this for backup.  I think it's a great solution and less expensive in the long run than buying external drives in their own enclosures.Highly recommended.
