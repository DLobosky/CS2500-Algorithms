Again Frank Sinatra gives another fine performance (he has always been  underrated as an actor in my opinion) and he even directed this film! This  is an interesting W.W.II film set on an island in the Pacific where small  bands of both American and Japanese forces are stranded. This film examines  the human sacrifices made in war and questions if there is justification  for those sacrifices examined through the camaraderie and reminisces of  fellow combatants on both sides. I always liked this one. Listen for an  early score composed by John (Johnny) Williams.
