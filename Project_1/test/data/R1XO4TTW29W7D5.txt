(Each cost about $200. which included shipping). Don't pay full retail for a new one, as long as the vendor will accept a return on the refurbished one if it is faulty. I suspect that some of the refurbs are probably just returns from people who did not quite figure out how to operate the camera. There are some technical issues depending on your brand of DSL or cable modem, wired vs. wireless, network security, etc. which may be too much "techie" for some people. It can take some time to work with the rather klunky but feature-laden software (through a standard web browser) to access the cameras for the first time and get it connected to your network. If someone comes up with a little better setup interface they'll sell millions of these cameras. I did NOT have to call customer service but apparently they (Panasonic) will help you pretty quickly if you get stuck. I just read the reviews here carefully, took notes, and tried the suggested settings. A friend on Windows said the included CD "wizard" helped him get one of these cameras going quickly, but I'm on a Mac so had to work through it more or less on my own. ONE TIP: you must connect the camera directly to your router with a Cat5 cable the first time you access it. Then you can choose to activate the wireless feature if you wish, and flip the switch on the bottom of the camera to wireless. Then re-power the camera and it will work wirelessly.I use and recommend Evocam software ($30.), a Mac utility for working with network and web cameras, and it works well with the Pansonic with a minimal setup time. Evocam adds features such as being able to set up a "zone" you draw on the screen, where if motion is detected in the box you draw, the software will record a photo or video, and even put it into a timelapse movie automatically. Other features can email or post photos automatically, add date/time or other text to the recorded images, and more. (Some of this is more or less available in these cameras anyway, but the Panasonic camera interface is far more klunky and slow). At the present time, I have two of these cameras set up as security cams 50 miles from here and can "tune in" with Evocam or look at past history easily, through the timelapse with date and time noted on each frame.The camera comes with free access to a website/service where you can post your image for your private review or optionally share with others. This does work quite well once you get past the technical stuff. You can access the camera controls and settings from a long distance if you set this up correctly.Do not expect an HD quality image, its 480x640 max but this seems adequate to see what is going on if lighting is fairly good. For as low as $200. you do not get extreme low light capability or high resolution. The sound feature does not work on the Mac apparently but I understand it works OK with Windows. I don't need or miss it.I also don't use the feature for panning the camera back and forth very much, I generally want it focused on a certain area of concern and left there. Be aware that if you pan the camera, it makes a motor noise which can be heard by those who are near it; it will cause them to look up at the camera.
