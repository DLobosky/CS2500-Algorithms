Click on the icon and it takes you to the puzzle. When you solve a puzzle, you click on the answer and it immediately tells you if you are right with an explanation of the solution, or tells you that your answer was wrong, try again.Some of the puzzles are relatively easy and some are maddeningly difficult.  Most of the puzzles involve spatial relationships/geometric comparisons - which is not my strong suit.  I found I got some answers correct but used incorrect reasoning to arrive at the answers.I think I would have enjoyed a more diverse mix of puzzles.  However there are definitely some good things to say about the puzzles.  Some are easy, some will challenge you.  It is all good mental exercise and the fact that it is interactive makes it a real treat.I would rate the entertainment value good for the cost.  Some people may not be disciplined enough to make a serious effort at solving the problem before they go clicking on the answers.  All in all, it is a fun little book that can give you some mental exercise.  It is also great for those times when you are forced to wait (doctor's office, airport, etc.) but don't have the energy to focus on more serious activities.This is a Kindle version.  Please do not dismiss this because you do not have a Kindle.  You can download a Kindle version to your computer and access it there.  It is a great way to start your Kindle collection.
