Some pages have several sheets of drawings on them These drawings appear to be studies done for other works of art and not finished products themselves.   Ingres is famous for his pencil portraits, but I only found 3 drawings that could be called portraits in this collection.  Most of the drawings are of nudes. Each page has caption that gives the medium ( e.g. pencil, crayon etc.) and the museum that contains the drawing.  The drawings have no titles.  The sizes of the original drawings are not stated.  There is a two page essay on Ingres by Stephen Longstreet, where we learn that the name "Ingres" is pronounced like "angry" without the "y".   He says that a drawing by Ingres called "Portrait Aged Eighty-Five" shows Ingres kept his skill in old age, but I don't find that portrait in this book.This volume is one of the "Master Draughtsman Series" published by Borden Publishing company, so I assume its purpose is provide information for students of drawing.  Without knowing the size of the original drawings, it isn't possible to know whether a given drawing is an astounding example of intricate detail or merely an average drawing that has been greatly reduced to fit on the page of a book. It would be silly to review a collection of drawings by a famous artist on the basis of whether that artist could draw.  The question is whether the book does a good job of informing us about his drawings.  I rate this book as three stars out of five to indicate that it does an average job.
