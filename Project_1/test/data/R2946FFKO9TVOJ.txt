This herbal tea (caffeine-free) is certified organic and is kosher.On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Grown in the high desert regions of the Cederberg Mountains, the shoots of Rooibos have been hand gathered by South Africans for generations. It is prepared like a traditional tea, undergoing meticulous drying (oxidation) and cutting. Organic Red Mellow Bush has an earthy vanilla taste and pleasing orange color with hints of autumn straw. With an anti-oxidant level comparable to green tea, Rooibos has no caffeine, is rich in minerals, very low in tannin, and is relaxing to the nerves. No wonder they call it the miracle tea. Discover the wonders of Rooibos!" What an invitation!It is my husband's favorite tea, and is pure premium rooibos. If you haven't tasted rooibos before, it is a pleasant, earthy, herbal flavor that most people like.If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love rooibos, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.*****
