The series spans from 1862 in "How Few Remain" and ends with a cliff-hanger ending in 1942 in the current volume. Mr. Turtledove assumes that Lee wins a decisive victory at Antietam and America splits into two separate nations. The Confederates win the rematch war in the 1880's and the USA defeats the South in World War I (with the aid of the German Empire). Now the series takes a turn and Mr. Turtledove clearly has the South standing in for Nazi Germany during the last trilogy.This new volume opens with the CSA launching a surprise invasion of the North in 1941 and launching World War II. The enjoyment of these books is to see how Mr. Turtledove's imagination works on the changes if we were two nations : as a Southerner, General Patton would be a commander for the CSA, New York Governor Al Smith is the Socialist President of the USA, the racist South has concentration camps for African-Americans and so forth. Earlier books had historical figures as well-drawn major characters (Lincoln, Stonewall Jackson, Custer, Teddy Roosevelt) which was half the fun of reading them. "Settling Acounts" has MacArthur, FDR and others as brief guest stars which is a lost opportunity for this series in my opinion. Mr. Turtledove is not a wordsmith but he is a good storyteller and the map showing the American continent divided into two nations will set you thinking. Because this novel opens without any of the history of the previous 80 years and only alludes to it, I recommend that the reader start at the begining with "How Few Remain" before reading this volume. One can read this novel on its own merits but the reader would miss the layers of richness that has gone before it.
