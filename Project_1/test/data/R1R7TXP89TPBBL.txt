As a freebie, I'm giving the kit Amazon 4-star rating ("I Like It") because it's a pretty good starter kit, though in my separate review of the Samsung SSG-3100GB 3D Active Glasses (the glasses included with this kit), I rated them only 3 stars ("It's OK.") because of some shortcomings that would cause me to purchase different glasses from Samsung's lineup. My review of the glasses is  basically contained below.The kit ships with Shrek I, II & II, with coupons for Shrek IV and Megamind. Samsung allows the coupons to be submitted via their website, which is great because instant confirmation is emailed back and there's no fooling around with post office delays. The movies shipped to me very quickly -- within 10 days. Megamind ships in its own box, while the Shrek disc was in a paper envelope but has a space reserved in the plastic DVD case that was packaged with the starter kit.The remastered in 3D Shrek I is actually quite well done, as is Megamind. I haven't made it through the other discs yet, and my only disappointment is that Samsung couldn't license some more adult-oriented material (aka Panasonic & Avatar), but the cartoons are fun for all ages when they're metered out.In actual use, the 3D glasses are great. A button cell battery installs into one of the "eyecup" pieces; the on/off switch is conveniently located on the right top corner of the glasses in an easy to find / easy to use location. Pairing occurs automatically and the television recognizes when the glasses are on and synced. I have not had any problems with crosstalk or sync issues and, being Bluetooth and NOT relying on line of sight IR reception like last year's glasses, I have no problems when I look away from the screen.There are a couple of negatives. - These glasses are not rechargeable. I haven't run out a battery yet as I don't have enough 3D content to blow through, but I imagine I'll need to stock up on button cells to avoid inopportune interruptions. - These glasses sit a tiny bit high on my large nose. This forces me to slightly lower my head and look at the television dead-on, to avoid the resulting "uncovered area" between the bottom of the lenses and my cheeks. This isn't *necessarily* uncomfortable or unnatural, but it does force me into a more upright posture and doesn't facilitate viewing from a reclined position (eyes lowered). This is a common problem I have with sunglasses, too, and probably isn't an issue for those of you with more "normal" apportioned schnozzes. (I mounted my TV "mid height" on the wall -- not at "above the fireplace" height which might eliminate this problem, and not at "sits on a TV stand height" which might exacerbate the issue). - The wide lenses (my theory) result in reflection from any surface or object directly behind my seated position. I had a box stacked behind the couch with some lettering on it, and the lettering shows up in the periphery of my lens. Two solutions: dark back wall either with lighting or with paint, or longer eyecups /sideguards along the sides of the glasses (yeah, I'm talking about cardboard or construction paper!!) to eliminate the entrance of this light.Of my criticisms, #1 is solved by Samsung's rechargeable glasses, but #2 & #3 would appear to be common problems based on appearance.These, being the least expensive glasses of the Samsung lineup, are probably a good bet to have on hand in the event friends are coming over to watch a 3D movie, if you're so inclined.
