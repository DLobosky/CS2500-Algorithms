PopFlop the stuffed bunny gets to take a balloon ride during the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta (every October--the largest one in the world) one chilly morning. His adventure takes him high above the launch field where he can see the Rio Grande, the Sandia Tram and all the excitement on the ground. Written by balloon pilot Nancy Abruzzo, this is a lovely little story that explains a little about ballooning--how they launch, how they land--in the eyes of a small child. Also available is PopFlop's Activity Book a classroom-oriented activity book that includes reproducible puzzles for older children. In addition to a concise explanation of how balloons work, the activities introduce vocabulary like altitude, parts of the balloon, ballooning history, types of balloons. Like Hot Air Henry by Mary Calhoun, PopFlop explains ballooning without being didactic, and offers the young reader a story with a child who stays on the ground (some stories put a child or an animal in control of a balloon-- even though it's a registered aircraft and pilots must  be licensed.)  Ages 3 to 7.
