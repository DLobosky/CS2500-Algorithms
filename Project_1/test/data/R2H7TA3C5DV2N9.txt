 Pro's:  At 2 hours, a great value.  I love the fact it teaches a bit of everything in the series--sword, isolations/tribal fusion, gothic, wings, hand veil, etc.  The instruction is always clear from the instructors, the quality is very good.  Also, while there are no choreographies I said, "I MUST learn that," there were several things from each one that I can use, which is great.
 
 Con's: Only one, in the fact that the camerawork during the performance, such as Ariellah's, shows the rigging for the lights and backdrop...meant to be shown but my ADHD brain just refocuses on it.
 
 Autumn Ward is the Enchantress.  Her costume is like Gaia, with Mother Nature themes--a flesh colored underlayer with green leaves and a woven overlayer.  Pretty work intensive!  The choreography has a great rising up from the floor, but in the performance, as my son was watching it, he simply said, "Like a tree in an earthquake."  May be the best summation (as opposed to a Nell-ish "tree in the wind").  I haved liked Autumn's work very much, and I understand this is fantasy bellydance, but there is some pretty serious shaking (not shimmying, but an arms/torso swaying) at some points.  However, there is also a sudden punctuation of a pulling in of the abdomen, drawing up the knee, that is beautiful and poetic.  I just can't get into the wild abandon movements.  A good comparison would be Laura Rose on the Gothic BD II DVD, but a bit faster. Her expressions are very good as well, and like with all instructors, her teaching is clear.  However if this is your first time seeing Autumn and you did not bond with the performance, check out her drum solo work.
 
 Isidora Bushkovski is a great dancer, and here is the Warrior Princess.  Granted, check out her Dueling Banjo's on You Tube, and you get a taste of her sense of humor. It is great to have a sword dance taught on DVD along with other things, and to watch her eyebrows and face during the dance adds a level of levity to it, which is not seen so much in fusion.
 It is also good to see how she controls the sword when it starts to spin, and how her fingers never cover the blade bit.
 
 Ariellah is Kali, destroyer and creator.  I love her yoga DVD, and her performances are amazing on the other DVD's by WDNY.  I did not get a sense of Kali from the music choice (Corvus Corax's Fili Neihardii), but the dance is visually interesting, the choreography has lots of usable parts, and Ariellah is a very good instructor, clear and concise.  She's beautiful to watch on film as well as live.
 
 Each dancer, by the way, gives the story behind the creation of the dance, which is a way to get a behind the scenes look at the creation of a dance as well as get inspired for ways to look at a song for your own choreography.
 
 Great DVD series, and great DVD.
