He had diarreha (sp?) initially. He was only on a wet diet when I got him. His fur was a dirty, dingy, dusty black and easily matted. He has been on this since May and his coat is gorgeous! I didn't know he was so handsome! Shiny, so soft and smooth. So obviously... diet affected his fur. Good stuff in, good stuff out. Another side effect - I think they have more energy! They sleep less and are in constant motion. Solid muscle.Rippy's former owner stopped by to visit him. She was amazed at how great he looked. I told her it was all thanks to Halo.I will be trying the sample pack of wet food next once I've used up the Iams wet. Not sure if Amazon has the sample pack, but I know the Halo website does. Great idea, by the way.. the sample pack. Really.. this stuff is very good for your littlest family members.
