&quot;Paying the Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; is one of the best short story anthologies I've ever read -- and every story here, every delightful one of them, has been written by one woman, Rosemary Edghill.  It's very difficult to believe at first that one person can write in so many different styles, as there are quest stories here, fantasies, humorous fantasies, alternate historicals (of a sort), and many more.  The earthshattering fantasy of &quot;Prince of Exiles&quot; and &quot;Scandal&quot; makes way for the more lighthearted &quot;The Maltese Feline,&quot; stopping for the extraordinary fairy tale &quot;The Fairy Ring.&quot;  And there's much, much more; the Aesopian &quot;Two Gray Horses,&quot; the alternate-history (personal) &quot;The Intersection of Anastasia Yeoman and Light,&quot; the alternate-history overtones in &quot;May Eve,&quot; and even a return to the Boscobel League (featured in Ms. Edghill's novels with Andre Norton, &quot;Leopard in Exile&quot; and &quot;Shadow of Albion&quot;), where Silver Stick in Waiting makes the biggest mistake of his career, in trying to prevent . . . well, you'll see.  Ms. Edghill's writing career has spanned several genres, including Regency romance, science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and probably more I'm forgetting at the moment.  And her short story collection reflects the same broad-based appeal as her novels, being as there are several wonderful stories almost too tough to classify except as the general, &quot;Read this!&quot;  Now, I've read this collection at least four times so far (one of these days, I might share, but not just yet), and I enjoy it more every time.  All I can say is, &quot;Read this book!  You won't regret it!&quot;
