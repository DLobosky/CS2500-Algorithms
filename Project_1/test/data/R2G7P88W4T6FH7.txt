During those days and months of difficulty, I recalled the advice given to me by my grandparents...I recalled my childhood with my maternal grandparents, and their influence on me--which is considerable.  I recalled most often the conversations I had with my maternal grandfather...This [book] is based on their insights, their experiences, their love, and their wisdom."The above is found in this slim but inspirational book by Joseph M. Marshall III, a Sicangu Lakota.  He is an author, historian, educator, motivational speaker, and Lakota craftsman.The entire book is in the form of a conversation between young Jeremy and his grandfather (named "Old Hawk").  The conversation occurs because Jeremy's father dies and so he turns to his grandfather asking him the complex question that titles this review.  Old Hawk answers this question by sharing his perspective on life, "the art of perseverance" it requires, and the pleasure and pain of life's journey.At the beginning of the book are two untitled pages.  Initially, I was confused by this until I started reading the book.  These two pages (where each paragraph begins with "Grandfather says this") are keyed to each chapter and have the MAIN bits of wisdom that Old Hawk passes on to Jeremy.  These two untitled pages are repeated again at the end of the book.Don't think that you can read only these two untitled pages and get full value from this book!  Each chapter is actually packed with wisdom and advice.  In fact, one chapter has "the secret of life" from Old Hawk's perspective!Finally, each chapter is simply but powerfully written containing dialogue, stories, and recollections.  After reading this book, I have to agree with what it says on its inside front jacket flap:"Everyone who encounters this stirring guide will draw comfort, knowledge, and strength from Grandfather's wise words."In conclusion, Shakespeare states "brevity is the soul of wit."  The author has proven this by writing a slim but powerfully thought-provoking book filled with life-altering wisdom!!!(first published 2006;  "Grandfather says this" pages (untitled);  prologue;  6 chapters;  closing;  main narrative 120 pages;  repeat of "Grandfather says this" pages;  appendix: the Keep Going prose poem;  acknowledgements;  about the author)XXXXX
