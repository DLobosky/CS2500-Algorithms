The most ingenious one ever! The story that fills the space between the cover is filled with adventure and romance. That pace in the tense moments is fast paced and filled with to the point descriptions that kept me turning pages. The romance made my heart sigh. And as I neared the end of the novel, the only thing I wanted to do was read. They say every book is predicable, and they are, but it is the getting there that is unpredictable. And this book fits that word to a "t". Each twist and turn left me turning pages faster to see what in the world was going on. The dialogue is realistic, the prose lends a wonderful descriptive quality and the hero and heroine are charming characters. How they act and move across the page is visible to the reader and quickly become real. Even the villain, who was all too real!This wonderful piece of historical fiction is everything it should be. Flavorful in setting and overflowing with the stuff that makes great stories. It well earned my five stars!This review is my honest opinion. Thanks to the publishers through CFBA for my copy to review.
