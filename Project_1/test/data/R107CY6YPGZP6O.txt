But I don't mind it. I like it better than fake smells anyway. I don't mind natural shea butter, either. If you can stand the smell of Palmer's Shea Butter (unscented), you'll be fine with this. And I know it's not going to hurt my skin--or give me an allergic reaction. This product has worked on even my toughest spots.I have one spot on my upper arm that gets so red and irritated; every time I get stressed, it comes back. This stuff works. I use it everywhere I have a problem, including my heels. After two days of this stuff combined with wearing a pair of socks to bed, my heels were completely transformed. Not exaggerating, either-- I don't think it would have worked so well without socks, but if you give this stuff a chance to soak in, it will work wonders.I think that if you have skin problems, you should at least give this a try.
