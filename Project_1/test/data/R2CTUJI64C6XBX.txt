First I'll repeat what I wrote in my review of the VHS version of &quot;Damn the Defiant!&quot;: &quot;There aren't a lot of movies about the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, despite the popularity of novels such as those written by Patrick O'Brian and C.S. Forester, but &quot;Damn the Defiant&quot; is an action film far above average. Not only does it boast fine acting by Alec Guiness and Dirk Bogard, it presents an unusually realistic look at life aboard a warship in the Age of Fighting Sail. If you like Jack Aubrey and Horatio Hornblower, then this is a movie you shouldn't miss.&quot;&quot;And I will now state that the DVD version is even better.  It presents both the &quot;widescreen&quot; as well as the clipped &quot;full screen&quot; versions (the VHS has only the &quot;full screen&quot;) and visually the &quot;widescreen&quot; is much more impressive, giving an even better impression of life aboard a sailing man of war.  If you are at all interested in this era of history, this DVD is a real keeper!
