I read one review that said these episodes are edited, but I can't tell the difference since I never really watched them back in the day. If they are edited, the edits are not obvious and don't interfere with continuity or the story line. The stories run for about two and three-episodes and are done really well. I do have to warn you that the last episode on X-MEN COMIC... is a cliff hanger so you'll have to get X-Men, Volume 2 (Marvel DVD Comic Book Collection) [2-Disc] to see the conclusion.If you like the "X-Men" comics or enjoy story driven cartoons then X-MEN COMIC BOOK COLLECTION VOL 1 is a must have.
