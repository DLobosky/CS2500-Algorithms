Had to change to a non meat, non poultry protein source due to my dog's inflammatory bowel disease. This food was my vet's recommendation. This food receives a very good rating on Dog Food Advisor, an impartial food rating site. Also switched to Blue Buffalo biscuits of the same composition. Along with meds and the food change he's improving. Also with free shipping on Prime this is a very good price.
