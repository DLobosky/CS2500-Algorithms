Here are the reasons I like it:   - Quick to knit, relatively easy patterns (this is an important one for me since they grow so fast).  - Easy to follow instructions, with plenty of extra information on sizing, alterations, etc.  - REALLY CUTE patterns. The pattern ideas are neat, they knit up quick and are still really wearable for an active kid.  - Ideas for ways to alter the designs.  - Patterns for OLDER KIDS - most pattern books are for the three and under crowd. It's as if kids just disappear until they can wear adult sizes. This is an excellent book for that older group.  - Patterns for accessories like hats, scarves, and cute little "pals" that can be used as zipper pulls and can be knit by kids.  - GREAT PATTERNS FOR BOYS!!! I have a boy. I need boy patterns. Enough said. This really is a neat book and has great ideas. The author is clearly passionate about the topic and has put a lot of effort into creating a wonderful book.
