I don't know if it is worth buying if you already  have all 7 seasons as the only feature, other than space saving, is a DVD with some extra bonus material. The only thing that I would change is that after the first 2 (or 3) seasons they stopped indicating which episodes had commentaries. So I find that I have to go through the DVDs one at a time to search for the bonus material. The next time I watch it from the start I will write down which ones have commentaries, but it would be nice if the job was done for me.
