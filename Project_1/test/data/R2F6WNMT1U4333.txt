Even at this early age, shows like Star Trek, The Six Million Dollar Man, and Battlestar Galactica were mandatory viewing. But each of them paled in comparison to probably one of the finest comic book to television adaptations ever, The Incredible Hulk. Overseen by Kenneth Johnson of Six Million/Bionic Woman fame, this weekly show took some of the best aspects from the comic book, and added a few of it's own, to create one of the most well-written and acted shows of it's genre ever. Starring Bill Bixby as the forever-tormented David Banner and Lou Ferrigno as the beast of rage trapped inside him, this series about a doctor who searches for a cure to the gamma radiation he inflicted on himself to tap into his inner strengths, but turns him instead into a six and a half foot green monster whenever he gets angry, was so well done, both kids and their parents gathered around their TV sets to enjoy it week after week. Miles ahead in writing than most Sci-Fi series of it's day, this is one show that truly has stood the test of time.The Complete First Season pretty much sums up Hulk's first ever single-season release. You get all 12 episodes (two of which are two-hour ones being the Pilot and the first airing), plus a bonus episode from Season Two. While most fans have grown up with the reruns or seen them recently on the Sci-Fi Channel, the picture quality is much better here. Granted, print damage of specs and a few lines still exist, it's color spectrum and black levels are spot-on, making this viewing seem almost made recently. Audio hasn't changed with a decent 2.0 mono though. As for the shows themselves, Hulk started out with a bang, but does suffer a tad from "first season jitters". Basically following "The Fugitive" handbook, Hulk basically keeps the same pattern, with 2 "Hulk-Outs" per episode. But it's the acting that keeps you in. Not hokey or corny like other 70's shows, but with feeling and drama. Sure, the transformations today look terribly dated, but considering what they had to work with, it should be forgiven. The only other extra is a commentary that was previously released from a single disc version of the pilot, but with all 12 shows you won't feel cheated by a lack of them. A great look into a classic Sci-Fi/Action series humble beginnings.With all the recent Marvel films that have come out over the past ten years, this television chapter should be revisted by all. Minus the hairstyles and clothing, it truly doesn't look aged that much. And I would take an actual actor sprayed green over fakey cartoonish CGI anyday. A worthy addition to your Fantasy/Sci-Fi DVD collection.-RedSabbath Rating (8.5/10)-
