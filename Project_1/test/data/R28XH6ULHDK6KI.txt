The 15-minute recharging time (for I-C3 batteries only) cannot be beat.Note: in addition to the free Rayovac  I-C3 15 Minute NiMH AA Size Carded 2 Pack, inside the package is the actual cigarette lighter adapter usually available separately for the cost of shipping and handling (and enclosing the charger's UPC). The 15-minute recharging time makes auto recharging practical even during local driving.In addition I-C3 batteries do get very hot during their rapid charge, not hot enough to really burn you or to damage the device you put them into, but certainly hot enough to startle you into dropping them if you are not prepared for it. It is also worth noting that the charger switches automatically to trickle-charging in case you want to keep a set of batteries "topped off".
