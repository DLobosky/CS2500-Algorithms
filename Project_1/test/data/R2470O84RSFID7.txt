Box set includes all the big screen movies that contained and focused on the original series cast.  All the discs reproduce the movies in high definition clarity for video and 5.1 surround sound.  You can tell the picture on the older movies came from older filming technology that isn't as sharp as today's cinematography standards, however even the older movies have been remastered to clean up and sharpen the image, making it worth having in high definition.  Many movies include additional scenes which is another treat.  As a Star Trek fan, I felt the quality and price are well suited for this product and worth my purchase.  Amazon also beat all the local stores in price.
