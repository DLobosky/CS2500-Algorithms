I'm on the shorter side (not quite 5' 4"), and I find that when I use the weight benches at the gym, my legs never quite touch the floor when doing certain moves, such as when lying on my back.  With this bench, I've had no problems at all.  It's sturdy, and easy to maneuver into all four positions.  A great buy!
