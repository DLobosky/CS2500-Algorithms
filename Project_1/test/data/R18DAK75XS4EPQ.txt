The video is excellent and is identical for both High definition formats. I gave the BD 4 stars because it doesn't have all the extras that the HD DVD has. I would have given it 4.5 stars if they had half stars. I have both High definition versions and both are great. But the HD DVD version is better because of the extra content.
