My Grammar and I...or Should That Be Me? is a great book for older students who might want a little bit more help when it comes to grammar. Like the other Reader's Digest book titled Write (or is that "Right"?) Every Time, this book is an overview of language arts and would not work as a complete curriculum. With random quotes from Shakespeare, Winston Churchill and Edgar Allan Poe, My Grammar is is written for an older audience than Write Every Time. For example, a gerund is explained in My Grammar, but not in Write Every Time. To be honest, Write Every Time is more readable, but My Grammar is a better reference tool.I received this book complimentary in exchange for an honest review but the opinion stated here is all mine.
