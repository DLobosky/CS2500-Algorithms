I am really starting to love this Nat Geo Field Guide.  I have used many others and consistently reach for this one the most.  Previously, I loved my (often ridiculed, seriously outdated) Golden-Guide to Field Id-Birds of North America, the best.  This NG Field Guide is somewhat similar in format, which makes the transition easier.  It is not perfect; none are.  I would have liked to see a more permanent binding and cover, also, better detail on many of the drawings and more behavioral details.  I like the thumb tabs, fold-out, indexed covers, extensive drawing coverage of variations and larger maps.  I, usually, use this one along with Peterson Field Guide to Birds of North America, which is a VERY close second.  All-in-all, a very good field guide.
