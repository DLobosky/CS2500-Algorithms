A good movie for people who1. Like/love "Wierd Al" or who don't know much about him.2. Have seen a lot of movies and enjoy paradoies of both music and movies.3. Want a clean family comedy4. Are of all ages5. Mildly warped sense of humor-- Plots 'R' Us mortuary; Teaching poodles to fly.For those people who have seen the movie...  I thought the funniest part is when the boy get's to "drink from the fire hose..." I was in tears laughing so hard.
