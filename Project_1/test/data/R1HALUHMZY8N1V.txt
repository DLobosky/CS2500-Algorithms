It's better written than the last few books of hers, flows nicely, has a lot of action, and it reads well.  I read it in one day.This review is for the other kind of readers.** SPOILERS **First of all, don't put me in the "bitter because it isn't Soph/Deck camp".  In my review of ITF, I stated that those two weren't going to be together, and I was right.  That being said, I thought Soph and Dave were a horrible couple, and I skimmed most of their scenes.  If I hadn't, I would have rated the book one star.  I guess my main complaint is that Brockmann changed the personalities of 4 people.  Sophia became SuperWimp, Dave became SuperDave, Deck - good grief, and Tracy became TessLite.  And there was no need for this.  Dave was a fine character in his own right, he didn't have to became like the SEALs he resented to win the girl.  Why not play up his strengths?  Instead, he has to become a superhero.  It didn't fit.I won't get into Sophia because there are so many more interesting characters.  Suffice to say I'm glad those two ended up together, because to see them with anyone else would have been even worse.Tracy and Decker.  Okay, I'll buy this pairing, not necessarily believe they'll be together forever, but at least for a while.  Tracy in this book has become super smart, wise, strong; why she'd settle for the mess that is Decker I'll never know.  My favorite line in the book is hers, when she told Decker he's pathetic and would end up alone, because that's what I always thought.  To me, Decker was always a messed-up version of Max, and like Max in his own book, once Brockmann opened up his head, you kind of wished she hadn't.  Decker is prudish, repressed, and not very likeable in this book.  Yuck.  And after the big reveal about what kind of sex made him tick, I thought we'd get more interesting sex between the two.  Maybe I've been reading too much erotica, but, lame.Tess and Jimmy.  Ah, THIS who I read the book for.  And she did these two perfectly, they were themselves.  The only thing I didn't buy is that Tess would have waited 5 years for Jimmy to tell her the truth.  Smart and resourceful as she is, I think Tess would have tied Jimmy to a chair after about a year with her list of what she knew and made him tell.  But aside from that, nice payoff.  Finally.  Jimmy had the best lines in the book and hands down is my favorite character.  The love Tess and Jimmy share could light up a room.  Now that's romance!I was jarred to find Sam and Jimmy in scenes together, though, like seeing Clark Kent and Superman in the same room.  As Decker is messed-up Max, Jimmy is messed-up Sam.  And while I'm glad to see Sam so darn content, his soulful, wisdom-dispensing is kind of forced.  But it was cute so I'll let it go.Very nice scenes with Jules and Robin, nice cameos by others, in all it was pretty well done.  Not the book it could have been, and really, I don't get why it took 5 years to tell.  It's the end of the arc, and I find myself really glad.  Nice while it lasted.  I'm done, because I have no desire to read about Izzy with his child bride, and while Lopez may or may not get his story, I've lost interest.  The SEALs and Troubleshooters are among the best written and involving series out there, but everything must come to an end.  This wasn't a terrible way to end it, I guess.
