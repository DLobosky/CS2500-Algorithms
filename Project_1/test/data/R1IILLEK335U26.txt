The majority of the movie contains archival news footage with Moore narrating but there are some interviews.  This is balanced with Moore's own brand of humor and satire.It's title comes from the 1953 novel entitled "Fahrenheit 451" that depicts a society where independent thinking is discouraged and books are burned.  (451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that's needed for paper to burn.) This movie was written and released just before George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 as president of the United States.The end credits of this documentary reveal who it is dedicated too:"This film is dedicated to...all the soldiers from the Flint [Michigan] area who have died in the Iraq war...the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our [that is, the American government's] actions."As a very brief overview, this movie begins with the strange events that occurred during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush.  Then we hear and see the horrors of September 11, 2001 and the president's response to these horrors.  From here, the documentary tells and shows us key things with respect to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.  The movie ends with a "Congressional Recruitment" by Moore.Moore also has some candid interviews in the movie.  Most revealing is the interview with a serviceman that had recently returned from Iraq.  When asked if he'd return to Iraq if asked he said "No" even if this decision meant "possible jail time."  His reason:"I will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people [e]specially when they pose no threat to me and my country...I won't do it."As I mentioned above, the majority of this documentary contains archival news footage, some of it graphic.  Despite Moore's occasional narration, this footage speaks for itself.  (I found it helpful to turn on the English subtitles when viewing this movie.)Of all this footage, one thing stood out for me: when Bush referred to himself as the "war president."Who will you see or hear in this documentary?  I'm not going to list all the names but here are some:Michael Moore, George W. Bush, George Bush, Britney Spears, Ben Affleck, Colin Powell, Bill Clinton, Robert De Niro, Al Gore, John Ashcroft, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, Dan Rather, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleeza Rice, Laura Bush.As a piece of filmmaking, I think Quentin Tarantino (who was the Cannes' president) said it best when this documentary won best picture at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival:"You [Michael Moore] won because we thought it was the best film that we saw."(The above quotation was obtained from the first extra found on this DVD.)As the more than 1800 reviews below this one attest, you will either dislike (even hate) or like (even love) this movie.  But isn't this a sign of a good movie--to illicit strong emotion?Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has ten extras, all of which I found to be very interesting and informative.In conclusion, I urge you to see this movie documentary for yourself and discover why this was the "first ever documentary to cross over the $100 million mark in the United States."(2004;  2 hr;  widescreen;  28 scenes)+++++
