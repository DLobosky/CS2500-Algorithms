Stick Medium Point Ballpoint Pens, 12 Blue Ink Pens (3311131), but there was a period where I couldn't find them (didn't think to shop on Amazon--Duh!) and so I was forced to look for an alternative and I'm glad I did. These Zebras are better than the Paper Mates in the following ways:    - One-handed operation. Simply pull it from your pocket and click it, instead of having to use two hands. (Horrible with a capped pen when one hand is holding something and have to sign a sales slip or something.) I will never go back to a capped pen.   - Rarely if ever blotch. (I can't remember them ever leaving a blotch, though can't guarantee that.)   - Rubber tips on thicker barrels lead to less finger strain and those indentations you get from having to grip a pen too hard.    - With the chrome clips, these pens almost look classy when they're sticking out of your pocket. They announce: "Hey, I look good, but I didn't pay a fortune to do it." : )    - Like the Paper Mates, they write smooth, the ink glides out of the pen, and feels good on the paper. And, wow,I've been buying them at an office supply store and been paying (I can't remember exactly) either $15 or $24 or something. This amazon price is incredible ($8.95 at the time of this writing).
