Her style is beautiful and impressive, with sweeping crescendos and perfect tonality and musical progression, all with great thoughtful lyrics and a sense of soul and heart that shines through. This is masterful songwriting and musicianship at its very best, and is not to be missed.There are only 6 songs on this EP, but it's practically a full album because you'll play them each twice. This is one of my favorite sets of all time, and that's saying a lot. Highly recommended!
