Didn't like the version of Persuasion.It was boring. You could not feel what Anne and Frederick are going through after seeing each other after 8 years,no emotion or feeling and expression.The 2007 version is better.Its not exactly like the book,but a lot  better and the Actors play the role fantastic.
