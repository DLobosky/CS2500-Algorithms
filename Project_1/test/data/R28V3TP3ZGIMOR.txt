In this volume, the reader learns a secret about Kyo Sohma... and this secret becomes a test for Tohru.This volume of the series, as well as this part of the anime series, is where Fruits Basket begins to take on a little bit more of a "darker" tone; this particular storyline is more emotional than any of the storylines that preceded it.  Personally, I think this is the perfect spot in the series to begin to start playing around with things a little, because the series wouldn't really have been able to continue on for much longer if this change in tone hadn't appeared where it did.If you have already read and enjoyed the previous five volumes of Fruits Basket, then I would recommend reading this volume as well.  This is the point in the series where you really begin to see some more character development, and see them start becoming a little more complex and even more interesting than they were before.I wrote this review after checking out a copy of this manga volume through the King County Library System.
