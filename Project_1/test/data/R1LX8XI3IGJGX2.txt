This product is very similar; in 22 categories like Travel, Food, Opposites, and Weather, each with around 25 words (for a total of more than 500 words), this program allows you to interact with the vocabulary in 5 different ways: by viewing them in a list with their meanings, by doing a multiple choice test, by completing a hangman-like game (with 5 mistakes allowed), by typing in the words (without accents), or by looking at flashcards. In each activity, the word order is randomized and for the multiple choice, puzzle, and write in activities you can save your percentage score. Each activity includes all the words in that category; it doesn't seem to remember what you've already demonstrated learning. There was one significant difference with the Spanish Vocabulary program - an additional category was added for "Thoughts" which included emotions and more abstract words; was this a nod to France's philosophical culture? This program was well suited to my Kindle 3 and loaded fairly quickly. I'm not sure I'd call it "fun" as the product description does, but this is a well-thought-out program with a decent amount and variety of vocabulary, at a reasonable price. I would have no problem recommending it to French learners in middle school, high school, college level, or adult learners as a useful vocabulary review tool.
