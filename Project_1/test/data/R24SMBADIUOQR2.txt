After a year of sewing, I don't think cutting the fabric is all that fun, but it has become much easier since I invested in good shears.  With the exception of sheers and knits, I use these for all my fabric. They are nice and heavy.  They are very sharp and slice through fabric like a hot knife through butter.  Denim is not a problem at all with these. The spring really does ease hand fatigue. They are perfect!
