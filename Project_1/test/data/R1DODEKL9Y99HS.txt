It covers the same core set of common analyses as the second edition but this one adds in more graphics, better coverage of repeated measures, it uses mixed effects models instead of older repeated measures ANOVA methods(don't worry if you don't know what that means), there is a bit about power calculations and throughout the book the code has been updated with modern syntax and new language features.  The information on the new diagnostics associated with many of the old procedures is extremely valuable.I highly recommend this for students or doctors who want to get their hands into the guts of SAS analysis code.  What it lacks in statistical rigor and proofs it more than makes up for with easy to read instruction and well annotated code examples.*** My review of the 2nd edition ***I have been teaching biostatistics and data management for many years and on the first day of the year I always tell incoming MDs, masters and PhD level students who are not mathematicians to go out immediately and get this book. When they graduate, they frequently spontaneously tell me that it was excellent advice and they tell me the book "saved" them either in class or on their projects. I have never heard a complaint about this book and that is REALLY unusual with a statistics book.Walker writes short chapters centered around common statistical methods. He gives a clean paragraph or two saying why you would use a statistic. Then he writes-up a little math, with the algebra usually worked out. After that the vast majority of the chapters are completed examples with datasets, code and output. The code and output are annotated with notes and numbered labels so you can quickly figure out what each part of the output and code means (in clear English).If you get stuck in an overly theoretical statistics class get this book and you will be able to actually do the work you need for biostatistics projects that use SAS.
