The wise words of Jonathan Livingston Seagull live today as well. "You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way." This movie is something the whole family can enjoy. And if you haven't already buy the soundtrack on CD and Richard Bach's book. It's a pleasant dream when you need one. That is one bedtime story I want to wake up to.  And for those of you who are going to ask me, "hey didn't you say these exact words when you reviewed the VHS copy?", you better believe it because now we can appreciate Jon's story forever on DVD.
