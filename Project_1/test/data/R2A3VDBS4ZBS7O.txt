This book, which from what I can tell the guy wrote in his spare time and beavered away at getting published, started his career as a professional hard rock and metal journalist. This book is set out in alphabetical order and amounts to 430 pages including appendix' and it contains 1 942 reviews of albums by Popoff himself. As such it is a veritable storehouse of information due to the fact that the albums are set out in chronological order with added info such as the record company and year of release. Popoff has copped a bit of criticism over the years for inaccuracies in this information but as he points out, some of it is estimated and other info is derived from the pressing he has to hand. My reasons for liking this and the other Popoff books that have a similar layout (he has also written some biographies of bands) are as follows;Popoff is a fan, he isn't some hack who wanted to rip the genre apart to make it look stupid. He really loves this music and as such I feel he has more right to vent his opinions than certain authors who have written books about hard rock and metal who had no affinity for the genre. Secondly his enthusiasm is infectious. He readily admits in later books that his writing does suck pretty badly in places but I'm willing to be very forgiving in this regard because to me it sort of allows his aforementioned enthusiasm to shine through and keeps things light hearted. Thirdly the very size of the number of reviews on offer covers a gamut of sub genres and this is where I think Popoff has done well - he hasn't taken the tunnel vision path of just covering a couple of genres. Plenty of styles of hard rock and metal are covered. Some readers of his work seem disappointed by this - the guy is happy to cover hard rock hair bands like Motley Crue but he'll also cover Metallica and Megadeth as well as Slayer etc. He'll cover quite happily a range of sub genres understanding that the average hard rock loving fan will understand that Def Leppard AND Deicide should be in this book.What he doesn't cover, it must be said, is punk - he's not really into it. Ditto for hardcore. He doesn't much like live albums and I can understand his reasons for this though I may not agree with him wholeheartedly. He doesn't bother covering greatest hits which is probably fair enough given the number of them out there, often multiple best of collections by the same band can be found with very little differentiation in track listings.All up, due to the sheer number of reviews and information gathered in one place this is a great buy to snap up for the hard rock fan nearest you. They will undoubtedly laugh as Popoff rips into one of their pet bands, nod sagely when he has written something they agree with and shake their head in wonder at how the author didn't dig one of their guilty pleasures.Some people tend to write off Popoffs books of reviews because he rubbish's their pet genre or pet bands but really - when you buy a book of reviews do you really expect to agree with everything written therein? More pertinent and important problems with this book are that it can be difficult to find nowadays, the binding quality - at least on my copy - was very poor and the whole thing finishes in 1993. And while I've given this four stars and mostly said positive things about it you would probably be better off getting his later books - his collectors guide to heavy metal series which now covers the 70's, the 80's and a few months prior to me writing this his 90's guide was released. Given they cover a specific decade each they won't date, if you take my meaning. And taken together they are a far more comprehensive collation of the worlds heavy sounds than this single tome from 1993 could ever be.
