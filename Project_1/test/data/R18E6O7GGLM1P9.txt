Finally a history of the political dogfight over the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Most books focus on the creation of the Constitution in 1787 and treat the dramatic ratification fight, state by state, as an afterthought. Catherine Drinker Bowen's classic "Miracle at Philadelphia" (1966) is a good example. Mr. Chatwick ignores the creation and goes straight to the ratification brawl between states's rights candidates and those favoring a strong central government (including the triumvirate of Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison). The history shows that ratification was not a sure thing due to the uncompromising nature of Madison and Hamilton. The climatic close vote in New York (30-27) was a reaction of many factors including the early departure of four negative voters. My only quibble with the book is that he focuses exclusively on the four large states (with passing comments on New Hampshire)-- it would have been nice to have covered all the states with a parargraph or two. Still, this is an excellent book on the begining of American politics.
