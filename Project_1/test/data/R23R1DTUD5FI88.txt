Prior to seeing this fine flick (for a Literature & Film class, no less), my concept of Hong Kong cinema was of late-night kung-fu fistacuffs, not the action extravaganza contained herein.  Boy, amd I glad I found out about John Woo!  I went out immediately after class, went to every movie store until I found the movie, and brought it back to show all my friends.Shining endorsements aside, Hard Boiled really is one of the finest action movies ever made, and as John Woo's Hong Kong swan song, the pinnacle of his action film career.The story is fairly simple.  Tequilla, a hard boiled cop to do Mickey Spillane proud, is out to nail the head of a local gun-running triad (read: Chinese mob) over the death of his partner.  He runs afoul of a planted police agent who has become so deeply entrenched in his triad cover that he even kills the head of a rival gang, and the two must eventually team up to defeat the psychotic triad boss and his gang of gun toting thugs.The opening minutes are sheer action ecstasy as a stakeout of a local tea house quickly turns into a shootout where tons of innocent bystanders and policemen are caught in machine gun fire and that ends with a flour-covered Tequilla putting a point-blank shot into the crook's head.  Talk about intense action and imagery!Later action scenes take place in one triad's smuggling warehouse (into which Tequilla drops and singlehadedly takes on and wipes out most of the bad guys) and the climatic hospital-filled-with-babies-and-invalids sequence occupying perhaps the last 45 minutes of the film.The film delivers all anyone could want, from one-liners to intense action--and for those wanting something artistic, the film gives us Tony's (the undercover triad/cop) story of wanting to escape the darkness for somewhere it's always light, and Tequilla's mission to not fail his partner again.  There's enough art anyway for it to have made my Lit & Film class.As for the DVD, the video transfer is fine.  However, there is not yet a 5.1 channel version out there--and since other John Woo films made in Hong Kong have 5.1 sound, I can't believe there aren't tracks out there for a suitable mix.  Still, the film is so outstandingly outrageously supreme in terms of action that I STILL rate it at 5 stars overall, for to do anything less would be an insult to the film.If you like action, you MUST check out this film.
