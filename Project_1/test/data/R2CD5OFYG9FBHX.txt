This review is after nearly two months of owning the device. I won't go into the useless wireless and garbage dongle that they sell for this item as that is more applicable to the Cinema go package. But if you intend to add the wireless feature in the future, forget about it. Just move right along if you have any such inclination. Absolutely awful worthless junk. They might as well have not included the feature at all.The player itself is very buggy. Sometimes it doesn't turn off. You turn it off, it shuts down and powers right back on. This is very common. If you want to attach a hard drive, you MUST turn the hard drive on after powering on the device. And then it doesn't always "take". You might have to turn the hard drive and/or the device on and off a couple times.The codec updates are sparse. You'd think they frequently update software to allow for various codec changes, etc. Not the case. This thing can't even play files with the flv extension. Oh, it can play flv files. If you rename them to mp4 or whatever, they'll play just fine. It's simply the flv EXTENSION that it has a problem with. And the support team can't fix that. Great job! Not to mention it can't play mkv files with header removal compression. Something easily fixed. But they can't seem to get it done at Brite-view. So you'll have to use software to edit the mkv header compression yourself. Honestly, I thought the biggest benefit to buying this unit would be software updates as needed. Boy was I naive.I try to contact brite-View for return of a defective dongle. It has been weeks with no contact. I try to contact them to replace or return the malfunctioning main unit. I don't hear from them for weeks. Terrible support all around. Maybe my credit card company will be willing to give me a replacement or a refund. As it is I'm going to buy the Patriot Box Office and give that one a shot for a while.------------------2010-12-27 update------------------This company is horrible. I contacted them to replace the defective dongle. They emailed telling me they would forward it to their RMA department. Didn't here form them again. I contacted them again about it, expressed my displeasure and asked to return the device and get a refund altogether as the whole thing is buggy and malfunctioning. They told me they'll forward the request to the RMA. Never heard from them again. This company is a joke. Do yourself a favor and do not buy anything from this company.
