I own a copy of that one (unfortunately) and  in the 50 Movie Pack Hollywood Legends boxed set by Treeline which is an erratic but generally good print, though some scenes have poor sound and others have clearly edited jumps, most likely from a repaired print that anything else. (I am giving this a one-star rating for print quality whereas the movie itself would be 2 or 3 stars). This 1931 Swanson vehicle was directed by future film legend Leo McCarey but his direction is one of the least inspired things about the movie which often seems stagey especially in the first scenes. The movie also can't make up it's mind what it is, starting out something of a soap melodrama with songs and then turning (more creditibly) into a wacky comedy, an very early screwball. Swanson stars as a successful New York businesswoman who is in a sexual romance with heel Monroe Owsley. She ends their affair when she learns he is seeing other women on the side. Time passes (although that isn't too clear in the film immediately) and Gloria falls in love with novelist Ben Lyon and is about to announce her engagement when her young sister Barbara Kent shows up with her new beau who just happens to be Owsley. Gloria vows to find a way to free her sister from the rogue even if it means putting her own romance in jeopardy. Gloria sings two songs in the film and one of them, "Come to Me", twice. She's gorgeous and is hilarious in the later scenes when she is out to make a bad impression at the Owsley family estate in a scene that foreshadows Irene Dunne's not dissimilar machinations in McCarey's 1937 classic THE AWFUL TRUTH. Best in the supporting cast is the hilarious character actress Maude Eburne as the girl's devoted aunt. One hopes a great print of INDISCREET will surface one day, it's lovely sets are depressing to view in a occasionally scratchy or blurry looking print. In the meantime, Gloria and company do their best to make an uneven screenplay and McCarey's indifferent direction work with the results fairly appealing.
