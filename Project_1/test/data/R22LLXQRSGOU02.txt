Both units had issues with the effects and the first unit's iPod jack didn't work at all. Unfortunately the problem was a loud screeching and/or buzzing that would occur when the guitar wasn't being played. Let me reiterate - I LOVE THE SOUND OF THIS AMP!!! And it is LOUD - play just fine with a drummer loud. I am incredibly dissappointed in the unreliability of the product. If you have a reailer nearby that carries it and don't mind returning if the need arises, than I would still risk it, but an online purchase was just too much hassle for me to stick with it. ***So in a short amount of time, I've burned through a lot of gear searching for the perfect "at home" set up. I currently have a Mustang, had Vox, Line, Crate and have played extensively the Roland Cube and Peavy Vyper. For those keeping score at home, that's pretty much every thing out there for mass consumption. The Crush is the only one I gave 5 stars. It has far fewer features than a Cube 40, Vox VT, Mustang or Vyper. So if you're looking for a feature heavy toolbox of an amp, this is probably more like 3 stars. If you are thinking, "just by a tube amp" - the closest in price - Vox AC4, Pignose or Laney Cub - are still simply to loud for home use and suffer from their own unique set of issues). sooooo...I went with what I felt was the closest to that tube feeling...The Crush gives you hard rock/blues tones that you can control either via footswitch or simply the gain channel, amp volume and guitar volume. The Orange also has a voice that is simply fuller than any of the above mentioned amps. The only other solid state that came close (opinion) to tone was the Frontman 212r, but with the 212 set up, you get more bottom end by default. For a single 10, the Crush is surprisngly full sounding.This amp doesn't model. In fact, it behaves like a tube amp. The "gain" channel with the gain and OD set around 12:00 gives you a very smooth and natural break up that has it's own voice, but can get really loud in the house to acheive the effect. The notes are articulate, even with the gain and OD dimed. That was what I just couldn't find, until now in any of the other amps listed above. Some have wonderful models (Mustang) or amazing clean channel (Roland) or are screaming metal machines (Line 6), but I wanted an amp with solid state features that behaved like a tube. It has a headphone jack, output jack for iPod and some effects that are usable.In regards to the effects, I will say that you cannot manipulate or stack them - you get 16 combinations that Orange chose and a nob to control the intensity of the effect. That's it. Fender, Vox and Roland all kill the Crush in this case. I use the room reverb and a Boss DS-1 distortion pedal. I get perfect rock, hard rock tones at low volume. Be aware, you will get some fizz if you dime the Gain and OD channel and really crank it up. On the other hand, with the volume on amp and pedal cranked, just using the guitar's volume to push the level of break up works flawlessy and gives me a tone that I couldn't pull with the other amps. For the price (around $200 - $250 for amp & pedal) and sound alone, it's just a dynamite value. Although both the Vox and Mustang series do a good job of emulating their big, toob filled brothers, the Orange Crush LDX wins in the tone department for me. Ultimately that's all a matter of preference. But after months of exchanging and borrowing various practice amps, I've found the amp that I hear in my head when everything is turned off.
