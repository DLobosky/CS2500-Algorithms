I initially gave this a solitary star because this sort of error should not have been made. However, I have since persevered and read it in comparison not only to the Tyler translation but also the 2010 Arthur Waley translation (Tuttle Publishers) and personally found that Seidensticker reads most easily among the three. Seidensticker's first line read: "In a certain reign there was a lady not of the first rank whom the emperor loved more than any of the others." Tyler's: "In a certain reign (whose could it have been?) someone of no very great rank, among all His Majesty's Consorts and Intimates, enjoyed exceptional favour." Waley's: "At the Court of the Emperor (he lived it matters not when)there was among the many gentlewomen of the Wardrobe and Chamber one, who though she was not of very high rank was favoured far beyond all the rest;" sic. Not familiar with Japanese, I am unable to say which was the more faithful translation.The Introduction by Seidensticker himself was about as informative as that in Tyler's. Denis Washburn's Introduction in the Waley translation was mainly a long synopsis of the story.
