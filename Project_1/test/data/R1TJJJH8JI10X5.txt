This delightful DVD shows the mechanics involved in creating the Beatles' first movie, the 1964 classic, &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot;  Footage of the Beatles joking around on the train and in their hotel room is included and this makes for a very delightful package indeed.  One gets the feeling of riding on the Beatle train, next stop 1964! during the train footage.  Each Beatle has his distinct brand of humor and input and it is just this individuality that makes this such a treat.  As much as I enjoy &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; I find this an added bonus because one can index the songs as well as follow the Beatles as they prepare for their very first movie.This movie will have you shaking your bangs, singing Beatle songs and shouting out a hearty YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!  Ideal for any Beatle themed shindig.  I LOVE IT!
