After replacing, I honestly found these work better through the night over a longer period of time. I decided to do a little research on Wikipedia to find the reason.These Moonrays batteries are Nicd, on the page it says: "The primary trade-off with NiCd batteries is their higher cost"But the advantage it says is: "the NiCd battery has a lower self-discharge rate (for example, 10% per month for a NiCd, versus 30% per month for a traditional NiMH under identical conditions"that means that over time, these batteries will hold their charge longer than others. The other type of rechargeable batteries are the NiMH batteries, and their page also says: "NiMH cells historically had a somewhat higher self-discharge rate (equivalent to internal leakage) than NiCd cells. This is not a problem in the short term, but makes them unsuitable for many light-duty uses where the battery would normally be expected to last many months or years."Either way, Moonrays DOES sell NiMh batteries, they're just a bit more expensive than these. These are all the moonrays batteries i've found on amazon. Moonrays 97125 Rechargeable NiCd AA Batteries for Solar Powered Units, 4 Pack &lt;- same battery as above, but in a 4-pack instead of 8Moonrays 97143 4-Pack AA NiMh Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries for Solar Lights, 1500mAh &lt;- NiMh instead of NiCdMoonrays 97142 4-Pack AA NiMh Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries for Solar Lights, 1000mAh &lt;- NiMh instead of NiCd
