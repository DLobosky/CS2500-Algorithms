They feel ashamed at needing her so much, especially when she's so happy to begin a life of her own.But, as Morgan learns, nothing is perfect. Just because she and Tom were so in love doesn't mean they won't have to adjust to actually sharing a life. In the meantime, Julie begins to explore her future as well, contemplating her unrequited love for Tom's older brother Geoff, her relationship with a longtime childhood friend...and what it means to stand up for what you believe in.
