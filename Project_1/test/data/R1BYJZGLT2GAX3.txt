I'm not disappointed that it's not in this collection. As to why it's not here, take your guess from one of the following possibilities:1. It being the last game for the Neo*Geo, SNK Playmore wanted to keep it available only for that system.2. SNK Playmore USA wanted to add it the North American release, but took it out to keep its Teen Rating.3. Seeing the negative response that the American-made King of Fighters Collection- The Orochi Saga got from gamers, they decided to just localize the Japanese version.Like the previous collections (the Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting & World Heroes ones), the main screen has a beehive design. From there you pick which mode you wanna play (arcade, vs. & training mode) & from there pick from the 5 Neo*Geo Samurai Shodown games. The first 2 games have virtually no loading once the game starts while the rest loads between matches & the load time is very brief. Of the 1st 5 games, the only one I found to be a dud is SSV due to the fact that bosses are very cheat & the fact that there are no endings. (the XBOX version of Samurai Shodown V had endings) Even III had endings albeit text ones & is more enjoyable despite the bad balance that game had.Samurai Shodown VI is separate from the 1st 5 games & has to switch emulators as it runs on different hardware than the other ones. Basically a dream match, bringing back every fighter that appeared in the 2-D series, it's the "Street Fighter Alpha 3" of the series. After picking your fighter, you choose from 6 "spirits" based on previous installments. Unlike the other games in this collection, this isn't based on the arcade game but the PS2 version & for good reason; there's more fighters, extra spirits (including one where you can customize your own spirit) & extra modes like training, & survival mode. As this is based on the version found in the Japanese version of this collection, everything's already unlocked from the get-go (in the PS2 version that came out a few years ago in Japan you had to unlock everything on your own.). Also unlike the other games in this collection, there's no blood or gore & for the record, the arcade game didn't have it either. At the end of day, you'll either love or hate Samurai Shodown VI. I happen to love it...a lot. Love the large number of fighters you can pick from & the new fighters (esp. Andrew who's based on President Jackson & Iroha). While the final boss Shin Gaoh is a bit of a cheat, he's easilier to beat than Gaoh in V & the endings are some of the best I've seen in the series. While not the best game here, it's WAY better than V will ever be.Even without V Special or even unlockablies, this is still a great collection & Samurai Shodown fans should rejoice. When you have cousins who play mostly modern 3-D games & can't wait for this to come out, you know this will be a big bestseller. Now I'm waiting to see if King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match gets released in North America something in the future.
