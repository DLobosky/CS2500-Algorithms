In this book you will travel with P&eacute;re Isaac (as he was called by the French) on his adventure sharing the Word of God with the Indians. He was born in France to a comfortable life.  As a young boy he heard stories of the New World, and decided he wanted to become a missionary to the Indians. He arrived in Quebec in 1626 and served as a missionary to the Huron Indians.  While traveling with them, he was captured by the fierce Iriquois and tortured and held as a prisoner.  He later escaped and returned to France, but he did not wish to remain there.  So he returned once again to minister to the Indians and died as a martyr.The Indians called St. Isaac "Ondessonk" meaning "bird of prey" because of his piercing eyes and quick movements.  This book contains a lot of interesting facts about  the Indians and their culture:  such as how they made canoes, how they lived, and what they ate.  This is truly a fascinating book for kids that I am sure they will enjoy.
