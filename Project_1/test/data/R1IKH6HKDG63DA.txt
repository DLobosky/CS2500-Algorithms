"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A single act of both compassion and arrogance leads to a war unlike any other -- and to the RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.The cast led by James Franco (as Will Rodman) & Andy Serkis (as Caesar) is great! The directing by Rupert Wyatt is excellent! The story & screenplay by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver (both of them also produced the film) is excellent!The music by Patrick Doyle is excellent! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is excellent! The film editing by Conrad Buff IV & Mark Goldblatt is excellent! The casting by Debra Zane is excellent! The production design by Claude Pare is excellent! The art direction by Dan Hermansen, Helen Jarvis & Grant Van Der Slagt is excellent! The set decoration by Elizabeth Wilcox is excellent! The costume design by Renee April is excellent! The special make-up effects design by Bill Terezakis is excellent! The visual effects by Weta Digital is excellent!This is an excellent and well-made action / summer movie that keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. This is just as excellent as the original "Planet Of The Apes" (1968). Andy Serkis' performance as Caesar is terrific. This is one of the best movies of the summer and of the year, so far.
