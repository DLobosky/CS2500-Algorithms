Young people desperately want to carve their own niche and acquire competence in the 20s.  In the course of doing that, they can fall into stalled thinking about living up to others' expectations and achieving  perfection.  This modest book is a good antidote to those misconceptions.   The advice encourages humility and realism.  Because Maria Shriver is a  celebrity who works in television, this message will get through to even  the most starstruck.The weakness of the book is that she tells her own  story, but doesn't use anyone else as an example.  So it's really a slim  biography of Maria Shriver from the end of college to now.  She is not  one of my favorite people on television, but she comes across as  well-meaning in this book.  Even if you don't think you like her, take a  look at the book.  You can tell after a chapter or two if this is for you  or not.  Of her advice lists, I thought that 'pinpoint your passion' and  'be willing to fail' were the most pertinent to young people today who are  just graduating.  The reason these are important is that your passion  will get you through the ups and downs in your chosen direction.  Failures  are your best learning experiences.Naturally, if someone you know wants  a career in television, this book also contains some useful information  about what the process is like.  It's more hard work than many would  imagine!
