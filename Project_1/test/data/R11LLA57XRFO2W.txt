The extra hundred pages do add a lot and are definitely worth buying the book again for.  However the book does NOT have anything indicating which sections are new.  It would have been nice if there was some annotation to indicate which parts are new.  I also wish that there had been more comments by Feehan giving her opinion on the new sections and why felt they were important.  These things are not there.  The story is just presented as a whole story.  It's a great read, and a must read for Feehan fans, but it's presented as something you have to read as a whole story.  It doesn't give any analysis.Below is my review of the book in general, because some people may be considering reading it for the first time.  If you're thinking about it, buy this!  You won't be sorry.This book is excellent! I knew the male angst in it along with the vampire element would make me like it, but I had no idea how much. The world created by this book is what really intrigues me. It's a canon universe full of nothing but angsty males longing for their soulmates, STRONG females that can save them. It's perfect!Here's a brief description. I don't consider it so spoilery that it needs to be behind a cut, but it does contain a little bit, just a description of the universe.The Carpathian's are another race of beings, strong, powerful. But they are dying out. They are almost all males now. Carpathian's NEED a soulmate. Without one, they lose the ability to see color, the ability to feel emotions, and eventually lose themselves to the darkness. As the time passes on and a Carpathian male reaches that threshold, he has the choice to kill himself and meet the sun or let the evil and darkness consume him and become a vampire. So, in essence, you have an entire race of dark, despairing males searching for a strong woman to save them from their anguish.I really liked both the lead characters in this story. Raven is strong and non-whiny. What? A decent heroine? Yes!!! Mikhail is powerful and aristocratic, but fully at her mercy. I love his role as prince of his people. He's the perfect mix of confidence bordering on arrogance and need, despair, and pain. I really wish I could read more stories focused just on them. But, at the same time, the side characters definitely intrigue me, and I am very very very much looking forward to reading about all the other Carpathian men, Gregori, Jacques, and Aidan the most. The possibilities for the set-up the author has created are unlimited. I went ahead and bought all the books in the series right away.I will warn that some parts verge on dubious-con, but they are soulmates and happy together.The only negative I will say is that the actual writing style is very jarring to me. The perspective switches frequently. One sentence is Raven's thoughts, and the next in Mikhail's. Mildly annoying but easily overlooked since the plot is so amazing.
