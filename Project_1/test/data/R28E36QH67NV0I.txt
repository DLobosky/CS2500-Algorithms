I generally don't buy knives which have blades under 3 inches..  Just a thing for me. So, I've been eye-balling the larger version of this knife from Boker-Plus (The Armed Forces II).  I thought, maybe, I'll check out the smaller one and pay a bit less, and the bigger one might come after review.  I'm pretty impressed with this tank-like tactical folder - it's a mid/heavy duty knife which the handle closely mimes the revered Stryder customs knives out there.  The handle is a nicely checkered G-10 (my favorite handle material for feel, grip, and light-ness); it's vigorously jimped on the top and bottom and offers exception gripping ability - probably the best grip design for any tatical folder I own.  Nice job Boker!  I love this handle (and you will too).  However, this handle is not for dress pants/slacks - the jimping could tear your pants-pocket up.  Continuing... The handle is comfortable and aft for this small-bladed knife.  In fact, the handle is a bit bigger than you might expect considering the blade length is only about 2.6 inches.  This knife has a well-built pocket clip for right/left/tip-up/tip-down carry (another nicety); it does however, ride a bit low on the knife.  Their are finger flippers on the top and bottom.  The one on the bottom (when open), is really their for looks more than anything, but I do like the design (because this knife can be used like an Emerson - just flip the pocket clip to tip-up carry, and when you pull the knife out of your pocket the low flipper catches on your pocket and the knife will open as you pull it completely out of your pocket (see you-tube vids for further details on how this works).  The tanto blade on this knife is 440C, and it's mid-road steel which has good toughness, and corrosion resistance.  I find it hard to sharpen on my other newer Boker knives - but am unsure on this one.  This isn't a bother, because this knife is really for self-defense and show more than anything.  The blade is thick for a small knife, and the bevel is interesting in that they ground-down one side and left the other.  Out of the box, it's very sharp (shaves hair), and will be easier to sharpen in the field with just one side to hone.  I'm guessing the the angle on the single-bevel is about 30 degrees.  I mentioned earlier that it could do some mid-heavy duty things for it's size, but there are better knife choices for a daily working-tool.  This really isn't a working tool for repeat business (daily box cutting etc.).  The thumb studs on this knife are not good for deploying the blade, the flipper works good though (and has some nice jimping); the studs basically serve as stops for the blade when fully opened.  The lock-up is vault solid and the pivot looks to be large - yay!  The construction is hex-screw together, and the over-all weight feels balanced and good in the hand.  Lastly, the liner lock works nicely with assured clicking noises when opened; this little knife is over-built for tough use, but the liner lock is behind the other features - seems like a normal liner lock - not a bad thing for a $28 knife.  Made in China, but no worries - the QC is high quality here (smooth operation, solid lock-up, no blade-play etc) - if this were made in America this knife would be $60 plus - maybe more. I will be purchasing the Armed Forces II because of this little tank of a knife. You will not be dissapointed in this tough little knife - it has bigger arms than you think at a very good value!  Get u 1 and you'll be pleased/surprised!
