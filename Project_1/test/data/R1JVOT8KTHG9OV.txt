Our family is a military family which means that we are ALWAYS moving. I have a ton of these that I bought for moving but also for storage. I've had the cheaper versions where the lid just snaps on rather than latching on and I prefer these. The lids are also stronger and the clear plastic is slightly thicker. Clear plastic means that I don't have to open every tub to find what I'm looking for, which is awesome when you're in the middle of unpacking. They also stack very nicely in a moving truck and in closets. The only problem with these is that the bottom isn't flat - but that's so that they stack really nicely - so this isn't the ideal storage solution for dvd's, games, and blu-rays. I would suggest getting the 30-quart version if you want these for dvd's.
