If you have relied on processed food in the past and now are going to try cooking from scratch, you may find this book helpful. However, if you have always been cooking, this book is a big waste of your time and money. As another reviewer mentioned, all you have to do is get out your Joy of Cooking and omit whatever your child is allergic too from the recipe and you have this cookbook. The author's tone is enthusiastic and good for her for trying to help others, but if you are egg/dairy/soy sensitive, find another cookbook because all the recipes contain one, if not all, of those three.
