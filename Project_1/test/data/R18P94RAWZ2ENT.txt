I was not sure how many screen protectors I would get with this purchase, since it did not specify, in the past most packs come with three.  However, this pack only included one.  I was kind of bummed that it only included one (since it was like $7), however, after carefully putting it on (do it right, since you only have one and once you put it on it cannot be used again).  It was easy to put on, clean the screen with the included towel, place it carefully on the screen and then press down on it from top to bottom (or bottom to top), carefully making sure it goes on straight, I do top to bottom since the holes at the top need to align perfectly.  Then use the hard card to press out the bubbles (this is tough so be patient -- I find do this once right and it will last for years (depending on use, based on my iPhone's screen protectors).  I finally got in on perfectly and got the bubbles out (you cannot even tell it is on there).  The first thing I noticed is that when viewing white screens on the phone you can see this type of fuzz on the screen (wiping will not take it off, it is just the screen protector).  I was not happy with that at first, but after using the phone for some time, I have found that the phone does not collect finger prints (the grease it does get on it wipes off easily), and it does not reflect light, so It does not have that mirror affect that my iPhone had (where you see yourself in the screen), which makes using the phone in high lights area easier (like outside).  It does not glare, and I am able to keep the screen brightness down without having losing the ability to see and am able to save the battery!In the end this helps reduce smudges and allows greasy residue to wipe off easily without streaking.  The phone is also easier to see since it does not reflect and makes it easier to see the screen in brighter areas.  My only flaw is that a white screen adds this weird fuzz to it, but for the anti glare ability of this screen protector I can live with that!  It is very nice, I wish it came with more for the money, but as long as you do it right the first time you will not have to do it again for years (based on past usage of screen protectors).  If you are using an XPERIA Sola, I highly recommend this screen protector!  I wish I found one like this for my iPhone back when I had it.
