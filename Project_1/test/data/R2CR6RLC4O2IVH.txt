

Strait-laced attorney Jane, on the fast track to partner, discovers that she was Janey, the inspiration for a mega-hit song about a party girl 15 years ago. Now the one-hit wonder rock star is making a comeback, and being reunited with Janey is part of the promotion. Jane tries to connect with her inner Janey to figure out what he'd seen in her all those years ago, and ends up learning about herself. With a couple of small threads left hanging, and a couple others that weren't developed quite as well as they could have been, this could have been an excellent book if it had about 100 extra pages.
