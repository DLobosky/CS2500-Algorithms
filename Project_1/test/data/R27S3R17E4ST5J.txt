All I can say is  shame on American TV producers who are stuck in the ruts of "reality" TV, and CSI ad nauseum!Can you believe that they are even going to re-make Hawaii Five-0???? Jack Lord will come back from his grave to "Book 'Em!" But on a purely technical note,  I have noticed that some people are having trouble accessing the "closed captioning" feature. It is NOT on the discs themselves. You must have your TV set up to access them. AND if you are using a HDMI cable(as I was), instead of the one your set came with, you can't access at all. Try changing cables. Fortunately, Series 6 has subtitles accessed from the disc menus.  Now for Series 7,8,9, etc:ScottPS Sometimes we Yanks have trouble understanding the cockney accents in British TV. Or is it my age!!!!????
