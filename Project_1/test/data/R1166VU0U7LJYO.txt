These actors, writers, directors, and everyone else involved in this amazing production obviously care very much about keeping it real in this partially supernatural world, and they succeed. I can't say enough about the acting on this show, this is a very talented group of people who bring the books to life, but also add even more dimension to the characters and stories.  The books are told from Sookie's point of view, and that handy little gift/curse she has, being able to hear other people's thoughts. The TV show is able to follow other characters stories as well, and it's wonderful the way they have kept the voice of the author, while expanding the stories to include more details about the other characters lives.  It all feels true to the spirit of the books.It's easy to see if you will like this, just watch a few of the clips included above.  The stories have sex, action, adventure, self-reflection, desire, bigotry, prejudice, life and death situations, parental issues, fanatics, despair, relationships of all kinds, friendships, and all of this is set in the ever-present "world" of the deep south.  It adds a flavor that is has everything from cajun spice to homemade jam.  It keeps you wondering what will happen next, and caring about all of these people.The DVD commentaries are very good, and it's really fun to hear all of the actors speak in their real voices, and various real accents,  as well as appreciate just how good these actors are.  It's obvious their is a lot of appreciation among cast and crew, and they do a great job of giving insider information that is useful and interesting.  My only negative is that they didn't include a gag reel!  WHY?  Loved it.
