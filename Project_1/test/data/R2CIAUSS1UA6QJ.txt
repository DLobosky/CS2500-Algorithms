The fourth grader has a full plate with homework, peers and watching her delightfully high spirited sister, Ramona. Ramona is a delightful, strong character and not a tiresome "girly-girl" cliche.  She is daring and fearless and has a mind of her own.  I could always relate to Ramona and she was one of the very first female characters I really loved.Ramona loves books about construction equipment, despite Beezus' sexist misperception that "girls aren't supposed to be interested in machinery;" loves all kinds of machinery, insists that her name is written with a series of scribbled i's and t's because she saw Beezus writing her name "Beatrice" in script and liked the way the i's and t's looked; she had wonderfully original expressions such as her eyes were "brown and white," she throws a party without permission and she has the police escort her home on one occasion. My favorite part was when Ramona accidentally ruined Beezus' birthday cake. She placed a rubber doll in Beezus' cake while it was still in the oven. Her explanation? She was pretending to be the witch in "Hansel & Gretel." I laughed until I cried at that part. It was hilarious! Luckily, the girls' Aunt Beatrice saves the day by buying Beezus a birthday cake. She regales the girls with stories about how she was a "Ramona" to their mother, her older sister. This is truly a classic that I still love. Ramona was my first favorite fictional female protagonist. She was bright and high spirited and I could relate to that. I still love Ramona.RAMONA THE PESTWhirlwind Ramona barrels into kindergarten, just as this delightul, irrepressible high spirited child has barreled into the hearts of her readers. I have loved this book since I was a child.Ramona is a delightful, strong character and not a tiresome "girly-girl" cliche.  She is daring and fearless and has a mind of her own.  I could always relate to Ramona and she was one of the very first female characters I really loved.  She also has high reasoning abilities; when told to leave for school "at a quarter past 8," she waits until 8:25 because "a quarter is .25c."  That shows high intelligence.Ramona, now 5, is a "big kid" now. She and her friend Howie Kemp are in kindergarten and they love their teacher, Ms. Binney. Ramona is still wonderfully expressive, and very funny. She names her doll Chevrolet, she lends Howie her battered stuffed bunny for show and tell, she pulls her nemesis Susan's long ringlets to see them "SPROING!" I love the part where Ramona draws a house with a smoky chimney because the "chimney is stopped up with Santa Claus." I laughed so hard at that part!Ramona's hair pulling has gotten her into big trouble. A parent conference is scheduled and Ramona has been suspended. Luckily for all, Ramona's kindergarten status has been reinstated and the lovable, Dutch-bobbed moppet is once again bringing many smiles to faces of all ages. I still love this one. It is very funny.
