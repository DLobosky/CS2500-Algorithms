He tells her about safety rules, how to operate the bike and more. And D.W. practices. She starts learning tricks and becomes really good at it. But then --- D.W. wants to remove her training wheels. What will happen?Another charming story featuring Arthur's sister D.W. D.W. shows how to be "can-do" and work to learn to be good at something. The illustrations nicely convey the action and have a sweetness to them as well.
