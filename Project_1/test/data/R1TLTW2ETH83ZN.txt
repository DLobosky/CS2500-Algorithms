It's not that this is that bad, it is that it is so catastrophically boring. She has eschewed the dance-latin-pop vibe that had an irresistible ...-shaking quality to it, for an impossibly bland, mid-tempo sound.The worst thing about this album is that when you try to hum or recall the tunes afterwards, you will most likely end up humming a different song done by somebody else. These are too generic."On The 6" and "J. Lo" are much better, with much more personality, and some catchier-than-hell tunes.
