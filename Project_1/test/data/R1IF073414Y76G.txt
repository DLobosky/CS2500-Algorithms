A rip-roaring thriller, The Palmyra Impact tears off to a start with an asteroid's impact in the Pacific Ocean.  The shock wave it triggers tests the tsunami warning system to its limits, and equally strains the nerves of the books' characters and its readers as disaster looms for the Hawaiian Islands.Boyd Morrison's taut prose plummets the reader through a series of disasters, near misses and anguish for the fates of deftly drawn characters, some of whom readers will quickly take under their wings as new friends.  As in all disasters, not all loved ones survive.For sheer readability, thrills, plot complexity and plain old nail-biting fun, Morrison's book earns a place on the top shelf among thrillers of the year.
