TO ALL YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE KNOCKEN THIS FLICK ,ALL YOUR LETTING ME KNOW IS THAT YOUR NOT TRUE &quot;T.C.M&quot; FANS OR REAL HORROR FANS!!!!!!!!!!!because if you were you would realize that this is not only the best addition to the &quot;T.C.M&quot; collection since the original its also a great horror movie on its own!!if you don't like this movie then your the kind of person that thought &quot;I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER&quot; was actually a scary movie!!!GET REAL!!!!to the true &quot;T.C.M&quot; fans the double disc set is awsome its everything a dvd collector is looking for,you will see what i mean when you get it!!the best part of the extra feature's is a little documentary on ED GEIN called &quot;the ghoul of plainfeild&quot; now this is for all the little kiddys that believe that there was a real leatherface running around with a chainsaw killing anyone who crossed his path!?!?WRONG!!!HA!HA!HA! here you learn the real truth! here you learn that the truth can acually be more crazier scarier&amp; darker then the movie!!!!!!! THE ORIGINAL TEAXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE IN MY EYE'S IS BY FAR THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE!! NOT BECAUSE OF GREAT ACTING/PICTURE QUALITY/ALOT OF BLOOD/OR SPECIAL EFFECTS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS WITH THE EXCEPTION'S OF THE GREAT!!!MARILYN BURNS&amp;GUNNER HANSON THE MOVIE CONTAINED NONE OF THE ABOVE.WHAT MAKES IT THE BEST!! IS ALL OF THOSE FLAWS MIXED IN WITH NEW YOUNG GREAT DIRECTING(tobe hooper) GIVES IT A DOCUMENTARY FEEL AND IN MY OPINION THERE IS NOTHING MORE SCARY THAN A REALISTIC SITUATION!!!!!back to &quot;T.C.M&quot;2003 with the exceptions of the picture quality&amp; the soundtrack it pays great respect to the original!!! so hurry up and get this awsome horror movie they don't make as good as this these days!!!!BUT LIKE I SAID, BEST SINCE THE ORIGINAL!!!!!!!BUT NOT A REMAKE!!!!ITS A GOOD HORROR MOVIE ON ITS OWN!!!!!!!!!!!
