This film was very exciting to watch.Is this film worth seeing?Definitely!How is the CGI since the movie has a lot of it?Well the CGI is much better than I thought it would be. The CGI is better than most other movies.This movie has a ton of CGI since it mostly takes place in outer space so it is good that it is decent.How is the acting?The best performances come from Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong. Most of the other acting is good but of course it is not oscar worthy.How are the special effects?The special effects are what make this movie. They are top notch and outstanding.How was the dialogue?Dialogue is passable. It is decent but remember it is a superhero movie.How is the directing?Well the directing is above average. The movie flows nicely but there are a few problems in some parts.Do I recommend you see this film?Yes! I highly recommend you see it because it is just plain fun. Just go in and have a good time.I do have just a few complaints with this movie. The character development in this movie was not asdeep as in other films. The story is not very deep but I was not expecting it to be. Lastly, the GreenLantern was just a little too powerful. I would've liked to see him have just a little less powerbut it is just my opinion. The Green Lantern franchise has a ton of potential and I can't wait tosee what they do with the Green Lantern.Overall, this is one above average superhero movie. I know some people don't like superhero moviesbecause there are so many of them but give this one a chance. This movie impressed me and I hope impressesyou too. This movie is just plain fun and made for everyone to enjoy. This is definitely a great movieespecially if you like the Green Lantern as much as I do. I recommend this movie especially to kids butalso to anyone who enjoys superhero movies.
