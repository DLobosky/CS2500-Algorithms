From all the sequels I have seen I would have to say yes. The 5th episode in the `Star Wars' saga is by far the most well put together installment. The acting is superb with a lot of heart and the story is just incredible. Before `Revenge Of The Sith' was released this one was my favorite.  What makes this movie a cut above the rest is the fact that the forces of good and evil is extremely intense because both sides now know what they are fighting for and each side will stop at nothing to win. You can see it in the way the characters are. The heroes are closer with one another (especially Han and Leia) and the villains are fiercer. I mean Darth Vader has gone so far to the edge he kills his own men for making mistakes...God man! There are also new characters introduced in this film. The bounty hunter Boba Fett, who's past, is now known. He still manages to be the bad ass that he is. Yoda returns (remember we are going from Episode 1) I love Yoda in this movie as apposed to the others because we see how strict of a teacher he can be without the flashy light saber techniques. Of course, who can forget about smooth talker Lando Calaressian? Just like Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams brings a whole new level of scum to the story and it couldn't be more enjoyable to watch. This movie is also C-3P0's time to shine. He delivers the best lines and best comedy and a fun fact for all of you Jar Jar haters...3P0 was hated just as much in 1980 so leave Mr. Binks alone.Even though the entire story is complete on film and the story of Anakin has been seen...the moment where he tells Luke that he is his father is still an amazing moment, probably the greatest moment in movie history. This scene is much more emotional to me because I now that I know what happened to Darth Vader, it makes me upset to see someone who has been through so much reaching out to his own son, but the question that we are left with when the movie comes to a close...Did Darth Vader really want to bring Luke into a world of darkness and evil? Find out the answer in the final installment of this 6-part review.
