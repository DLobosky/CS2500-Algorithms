Lucidly  analyzes the tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism to show their  striking parallels with the latest discoveries in cyclotrons.&quot;       --New York magazine &quot;Fritjof Capra, in The Tao of Physics,  seeks...an integration of the mathematical world view of modern physics and  the mystical visions of Buddha and Krishna. Where others have failed  miserably in trying to unite these seemingly different world views, Capra,  a high-energy theorist, has succeeded admirably...I strongly recommend the  book to both layman and scientist.&quot;      --V.N. Mansfield, Physics  TodayTruly a worthwhile book. The man who wrote the Foreword to my  own book, THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS, John Cantwell Kiley, M.D., Ph.D., attempted  a similar feat in his doctoral dissertation, which did not have the popular  circulation of Capra's book, of course, and was far more  abstruse.Kiley's book, EINSTEIN AND AQUINAS: A RAPPROCHEMENT, is an  attempt to compare Albert Einstein, the theoretical physicist, with Saint  Thomas Aquinas, although they would seem to have little in common. Kiley  studied at Princeton when Einstein was there, and so had a close up view of  him, and he knew Aquinas from his studies of the Saint. He found the  rapprochement he sought in their respective epistemologies.Kiley says  he is seeking to bring his book back into print, but it is a harder read  than Capra's. I recommend Capra's book.Joseph Pierre,  author of  THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS
