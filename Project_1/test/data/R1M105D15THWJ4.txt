Anyway, I haven't had many problems; when I did have a BIOS issue, I called Customer Service & was able to solve the problem on the first try!!! It's lightweight, and the battery life is pretty decent for a 14" laptop (I can get around 5-5 1/2 hrs), but only if I'm NOT running a whole lot of power-consuming apps. I've had a few IE "not responding" issues, but that's Windows.Processor is awesome, but the speakers are lousy. I'm not a gamer -- the most I play is Jewel Quest Solitaire or something like that.  This laptop really isn't made (spec wise) for high-use gaming.  I haven't had any problems with the touchpad, though some people have. Haven't had a chance to wirelessly stream video content from this laptop to my TV, because I don't have the adapter for that. Bluetooth comes in handy & I love using the MediaSmart option!  500 GB comes in handy for storing lots of movies & music! Don't be afraid to purchase this computer - it's great for students (because it's not very heavy to carry 'round), and for those of you who don't need a desktop replacement PC!
