The velcro strap is also easy but secure.  I can strap the phone high on my upper arm, run the earphone cable under my shirt sleeve, and I'm out the door for a jog quickly.  The case is thin and flexible enough that I can operate the volume and on/off buttons through it.I waited until an armband reviewed well, trying one every now and then, and this is the first that warranted regular use.  It's inexpensive too.I use it in conjunction with the Sennheiser PMX 680 headphones for running, with the Klipsch x10i for biking and working out.[11-29-10, lost one, ordered yet another.  Remains in use both at the gym and for running for both of us.][5-31-11, ordered yet another.  One at the gym and one each for us running.]
