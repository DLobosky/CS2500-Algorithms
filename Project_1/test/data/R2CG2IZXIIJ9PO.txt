The author dumbs the writing down just a little too much for a suggested audience of "Ages 10 & up," the book shifts randomly from past to present tense, and there's at least one paragraph that's repeated almost word for word more than once.But, that said, it's one of the ONLY books about the Aleutian Islands, and as far I can tell, is the ONLY book period about kayaking along them.  For that alone, it's worth a lot.One of my dreams is to kayak from Anchorage, Alaska to Russia, along the Aleutian peninsula and the Aleutian Islands, and in my research for this trip I've come across very few books on the topic.  My wife found this one for me.Not only does this book contain some beautiful photos (by Barry Tessman, R.I.P), but it gives a good idea of the dangerousness of the waters, of the area's history, of the general terrain, and of the preparations neccesary for such a trip.It's a quick read, but for those in love with Alaska or this area in particular, it will haunt you for days.
