I'm not sure why, its just no one could be very specific about what it was about, so it all sounded dull to me, the most I heard was "Its about a guy going in to people's dreams."  Other than that I didn't hear much else.  I have watched films by Christopher Nolan before, such as "Momento", and the new Batman films, but not because he did them, just because they sounded intriguing.  I learned a while ago not to pin expectations on any director, just to watch a movie and hopefully it'll be semi-enjoyable.        With my mindset as it was, having never seen a preview or anything, I actually feel VERY blessed.  The truth is is that you are better off not knowing anything about it as this movie is so complex and has many mysteries in it that it is just worth experiencing it and having someone try to describe it to you is kind of a waste of time, just go see it.  I will just say that it is hands down the best action film of the year, though its much more than an action film.        The thing that you should know about this movie is that it seems, from the reviews I have read and the people I have talked to whom have seen it, what will determine how much you enjoy this is a. Your expectations of the movie. b.  If you want something that makes you think as opposed to only a thrill ride.  or c.  You have an interest in dreams.  As many have said the film is slow and boring, but for me it was a very intriguing analysis of the sleeping state of the mind, but it definitely would have fared better with everyone if it had a more concise script.  The acting was pretty good, I am not particularly a fan of Dicaprio, but he did a pretty decent job as did all of the cast with what they were given, and other than Dicaprio's character and one other character, there was not a lot of character development, but there was definitely enough in his character alone to keep it interesting.  It is nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a higher profile movie, and its also nice to see Ken Watanabe and Ellen Page again as well.  The script had some glaring problems such as, at times, a lack of momentum and a lack of character development outside of the main character... but those are pretty minor since the movie quite effective and enjoyable for the most part and delved deep in to human emotions such as guilt and the long-term effects they can have on us.      I want to do an analysis of the film's ideas, but I will not do that here as that's about as much as I can say without ruining anything about the film.  Although this movie is not flawless and borrows from many movies from the late 90's, it does it, for the most part, fairly successfully. Overall, I would say, in a summer (as all summers are) full of midless action films and tired comedies, this is a much welcome reprieve for many movie fans.        God Bless ~Amy
