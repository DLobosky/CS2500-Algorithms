The fit in the ear does have some sweet spots and Shure provides a number of ear plug options to help everyone find something they like.  I have compared these earphones to my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones sitting in the rear of a jet while travelling (next to the engine).  The less expensive E3 beat out the Bose headphones with better high and middle end definition and equivalent outside sound isolation.  The Bose headphones have a bit better low end.. but nothing is bone shaking with earphones or headphones anyway.  As for Shure customer service--I had a suspected loose wire in one of the earplugs (used for 8 months) leading to dropouts when I would move my head.  I got a return form off the Shure website--filled it out and sent it along with a copy of my receipt to Shure.  Within 10 days, they had sent out a completely new pair at no charge.  THAT is great service.  The thing I have not told you is that despite the fact that I had a problem with the E3's, I could not live without some earplugs--so I went out and bought a pair of Shure SE420's while I was waiting for my E3 "repair".  (I had already given my E2's to another friend--who says he loves them).  Now I have my new E3 and the higher end SE420!  The only reason that the E3 did not get a "5" is because the SE420's are definitely richer sounding--something I would never have thought possible without having both to compare directly.  Can't live without em!  I would recommend the entire line of Shure earphones, buying whichever one best fits your budget.
