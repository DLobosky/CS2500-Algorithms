We advise you pay close attention to the sellers feedback. The 420 was a gift for our son in the military who wanted to stay in touch with us and his friends and brother back home. Both a webcam and a 1.3 MP camera. We didn't want to invest a large sum of money due the the fact he is young and travels alot and the camera is going to take some abuse, (Chad if you read this it was mom's idea to say that not me). As a webcam the resolution is excellent in all sorts of low lighting (indoors) and the colors are vivid and crisp. The audio portion is excellent ( I have a minor hearing impairment and he comes in loud and clear on our cheap speakers)As a digital we were impressed with the 420's images our son sent back again the colors were sharp and true. The hue & contrast were very good sharp and bright. Our son tells us he has droped his 420 several times and it has not deteriorated the quality of the pictures.Are there cameras that take better pictures than the 420? Absolutly; You will get better quality pictures with a high end Minolta, Olympus or Nikon etc; but not a better value for the money invested or the abuse this camera takes.If you want a webcam-digital that is easy and simple to use. That takes good quality pictures this is an excellent "starter" or first purchase camera to get; that is if you are not turned off by the plastic case. this is a good investment.When we rate products here on Amazon we take into concideration Level or class(1.3 MP in this case)Price.Value.QualityEase of useDurability
