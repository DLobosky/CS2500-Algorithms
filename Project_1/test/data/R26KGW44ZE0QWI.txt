It's all semantics.Anyway, if my face and I were going to work at home, I wanted to do it in comfort. So I set about making myself an ergonomic space to work in.If I really wanted to cast off the shackles of workplace injury, I had to escape from the desk. With this keyboard, I can type in any position -- sitting in my chair, holding it in my lap, lying on the floor, or stretched out on the couch.ESPECIALLY stretched out on the couch.Granted, I can't see the monitor from there, but as long as the keyboard is in my hands -- or by my feet, or under my head while I'm dozing -- then I'm 'working'. An awful lot of my emails start out "Dear fksannnnnnn...", but that's a small price to pay for eliminating repetitive motion injuries and wonky back spasms. Awesome product!
