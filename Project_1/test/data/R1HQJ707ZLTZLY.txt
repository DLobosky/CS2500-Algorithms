This film has a great premise and starts out brilliantly and only falters just a bit in the third act. Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are very good. However, Tommy Lee Jones looks about 15 years too young to be from the same era as the other three. Yet, I felt Jones came off the best and his character truly comes to an endearing end, which makes up for a lot in this film. All considered the camaraderie these four actors have really comes across and saves the day making the film really enjoyable. The animosity between James Cromwell and Clint Eastwood is central too the premise of this film and that also is enjoyable as it harkens back to the days when Dirty Harry bucked the system run by self-absorbed bureaucrats. As with most newer films, this Blu-ray version looks very good.
