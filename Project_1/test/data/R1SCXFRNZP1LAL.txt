I picked up this book with a little bit of skepticism because of all the hoopla surrounding the book. A few days later I was glad I read it.But here is a word of warning: If you are an ardent catholic this book might offend you. If you are not this book should fascinate you.It is a well written and researched book that excites and propels the reader's interest to turn each page. It grabs the readers from the very beginning takes them on a wonderful journey and never lets up until the very end.You will learn about the Illuminati and the Priory of Sion one of the oldest and most secret of societies and their relationship with Leonardo Da Vinci.You will also read about a Roman Catholic organization called "The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei", commonly known as Opus Dei. The Opus Dei gets a bad rap in the book and here is where the Catholics might be offended.Nevertheless this is a work of fiction and maybe the Catholics just need to develop a better sense of humor. And the ending in my opinion is well worth the effort to get there.This illustrated version helps you see what the author is talking about but I still get more out of looking it up on the internet.I guess you can tell that I really enjoyed this book and if you read it maybe you will too.
