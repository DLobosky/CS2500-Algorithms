The first part of the DVD is on the ground, longing, relaxation, and helping the horse to move naturally.  Then he explains the use of the aids of the bit and the hands and how to get the horse to be continually receptive to the bit but also in supporting himself so he is not leaning on the hands.  Karl demonstrates the ground work which includes working the horse in hand for various exercises including shoulder and haunches.  He begins to introduce the gymnastics to the horse.  In the second half of the video, Karl does mounted work using the same exercises that he did in hand and explains the moves.  However, this is not a step by step beginner video on "how to".  It is assumed that the viewer already knows how to ride and apply balance and aids.  It is more a lecture or even a workshop type of lesson on applying the aids and what to look for in the horse's response.  Because the horse pupil he uses in the DVD is a typical front-end heavy jumping style horse, the lessons are helpful to train the horse to find his balance and not lean on the forehand.  There is no hind end collection asked of the horse in these lessons because it introductory.I enjoy Phillipe Karl's work because his philosophy of "Legerete", the Philosophy of Ease, is inseperable from the training.  Using patience, kindness, and working with the horse's mind and body, Phillipe demonstrates masterfully the art of classical dressage.  This is the beginning of the foundation of his DVD's and collection is found in his other DVD's.  I've used the techniques and training philosophy in my own training and found it made the most incredible difference in my horse's flexibility and collection and overall wellbeing.  He was able to move much more freely, naturally, and with much more collection.The classical training is not geared towards contemporary competative dressage although many of the exercises in all his DVD's can be used for estabilishing balance and flexibility in the horse which leads to the end result of suppleness and mobility.
