I loved this movie,and I'm actually pretty picky about what i think of the movies I see. But Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are awesome!  The skeleton Pirates were so cool it's like a thrill ride.  I took my eight year old brother to see this movie, I honestly thought it would be to scary for him, but he (and my dad) loved it!  This movie seriously made being a pirate seem like the most fun ever!!  If you haven't seen it you really really should!!
