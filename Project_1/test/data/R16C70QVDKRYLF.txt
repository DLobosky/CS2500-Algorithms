There is so much to like about it and I especially like Ravi and Ana's calming voices..Ana is amazing..the video is 60 min and the workout is very easy to follow. I am not very flexible in certain areas and after a week of doing the video I found I could stretch further and felt more extended. The best part was coaxing my 80 yr old mother to try some of the video! She is rather skeptical about such things but after a couple of sessions she really started to look forward to doing some of the stretches and poses. I never thought I would see this as she has never even watched a workout video before but I raved about this one so much I guess I had her convinced. I could not touch my toes and have my hands flat on the floor and after a week of doing this video I can do that now. I cant wait to do this regularily and improve my flexibility and strengthen weak areas. I am so happy to have discovered Ana and Ravi and will definitely purchase any other videos they make. I even look forward to doing the video when i get home from work when before all I wanted to do was curl up and read a book or watch tv. Now when I do the video I feel I have done something so good for myself. Do the same for yourself and treat yourself to the great videos Ana and Ravi have created. These videos are a must have!
