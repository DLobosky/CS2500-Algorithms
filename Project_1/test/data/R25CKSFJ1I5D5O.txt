Much like in A is for Apple, the pace was great, the story was engaging and then the ending.  I felt that the motive was again ridiculous.  I can't imagine killing someone for that!  The Sophie/Luke drama took front seat in this book, which was annoying in parts as well, however I didn't roll my eyes at Sophie as many times as I did in A is for Apple.  It's a quick read, fast paced, entertaining, with a bit of fun raunchiness.  I might try the fifth book if there is one because I really enjoyed the first two. You can read this as a stand alone book even though it's part of a series.  It does involve the same characters and some of the storyline continues from book to book.
