Otherwise what we've got here is a mishmash of tired old Irish characters, caricatures, cliches and battle-of-the-sexes banter reminiscent of old '40s movies, way too many mishaps involving getting drenched and falling down in the mud in high heels; a script that does neither its stars nor its scenery justice and borrows its ending from the better-done Hugh Grant-Andie MacDowell not-exactly-a-proposal scene In "Four Weddings and a Funeral."
