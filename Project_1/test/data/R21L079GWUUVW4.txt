These bows are cute! i only took away one star because they were really smashed they were smashed into these small individual bags. Also some had hot glue on the ribbons so i had to take my time and peel off all the hot glue strings. But over all for the price they are worth it. They are extremely cute and everyone loves them when my daughter wears them.
