However, this is one of the weirdest, strangest, demented and oddest, [throw in any adjective that you like] films that I have seen. I thought the Japanese made some of the weirdest films around: And they do! but this one takes the cake. This Hong Kong film, by the Shaw Brothers, is one of the strangest I have ever viewed. Moreover, it is not for the weak of stomach. And if anything, it boasts some of the cheesiest special effects you are likely to view. Is this a great film? No! Is it a good film? Not really: Unless you are into extremely bizarre films. And after awhile viewing the film, you may not even care, as the film veers into so many strange areas that you wonder what in the heck you are watching. Also, don't expect too much from the special effects, as they are about some of the silliest you are likely to ever watch.So what is the fascination with this film? Who knows. Some will like this film as it is a cult classic. For me, after sitting through the film I actually got to the point where I just wanted to see where the film was taking me. And it takes you everywhere. I could not figure out some of the Buddhist symbolism the film employs; but at some point I really stopped caring. Then there is the journey the film takes you on that really gets bizarre. With Buddhist monks fighting the forces of evil, the director takes the viewer on a really demented trip. The Shaw Brothers give the viewer one mind bending piece of cinema that goes everywhere and anywhere. Moreover, fans of weird films might like this excursion into dementia. For this is not a typical horror film, or martial arts film.What starts out as a martial arts film, where a Thai boxer and Chinese boxer are fighting in a ring, then segues into a black magic film where everything goes. And I mean everything. As I was watching the film, I kept wondering what the script writer and director were thinking when they made this film. It never stops getting weird. And actually, weird is an understatement. This is a psychedelic mind trip that just keeps on getting stranger. The reviewer Morgoth has given a review of the film, and describes some of the strange parts of the film, however, he only scratches the surface. You have to see the film [or not] to believe it. Extreme caution is advised for those who wish to watch this film. It may be a cult classic, but it is very difficult to watch more than once. The film will not appeal to the vast majority of people, therefore, before buying, I advise that you rent it first.
