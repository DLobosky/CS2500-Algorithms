Now, of course, they must face love's challenges: new sleeping arrangements for Father Tim's sofa-sized dog, Cynthia's urge to decorate the rectory Italian-villa-style, and the growing pains of the throw-away boy who's become like a son to the rector."Add a life-changing camping trip, the arrival of the town's first policewoman, and a new computer that requires the patience of a saint, and you know you're in for another engrossing visit to Mitford - the little town that readers everywhere love to call home."----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Once again, Jan Karon has managed to pull off a near impossible task - making a story about a small southern mountain village into an adventure to remember. Mitford holds the best for readers - a delectable mixture of peaceful relaxation and beautiful imagery with a dash of adventure thrown in for flavor. The result is a dually charming and engaging novel that readers won't be able to put down! These High, Green Hills is an improvement on A Light in the Window, the second book in the Mitford series. The ingenious characters introduced in the second book saved it from a four star rating. In this third book, there are no new characters that I felt deserved any special note, however the plot development is better than that in book two. All balanced out, this leaves it with another five star rating and two thumbs up!Part of: The Mitford SeriesAt Home in Mitford (Book One)A Light in the Window (Book Two)These High, Green Hills (Book Three)Out to Canaan (Book Four)A New Song (Book Five)A Common Life (Book Six)In This Mountain (Book Seven)Shepherds Abiding (Eight)Light from Heaven (Book Nine)
