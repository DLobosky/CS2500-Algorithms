As with the other 'in Death' books, this is superb.  A truly unsettling crime spree mixed with deeply touching emotions and relationships makes for an excellent read.The characters, strong to begin with, just continue to strengthen and grow and draw the reader in.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and pleasure.  Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main cast members as they come into play and develop into first-rate characters. This series is additive!  This is the third time I've read Visions and I still love it.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author of Dark Nights and Sweet, Sweet Jessie
