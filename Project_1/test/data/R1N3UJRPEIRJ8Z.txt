To think that humans are nothing more than energy for machines. That the world, as we know it, has been pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth!If you have not yet seen this movie, you are probably dead or in a  coma. It's a mind bending movie that should not be missed. From the  storyline to the sights and sounds, it's a visual candy store that will  make you wonder for quite some time, what if this were true?Rent it, buy  it, do whatever it takes to see this movie. If you have a good sound  system, crank it up as loud as you dare, then sit back and?
