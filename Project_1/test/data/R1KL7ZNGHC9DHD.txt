All the quotes selected are focused on the spirit of the soul which knows no restrictions or borders.  A few selected quotes include the following:  "We never know how high we are till we are called to rise." Emily Dickinson.  Look at yourself through your soul's eyes. See the beauty of your being."  Sanaya Roman.  In conclusion, if you love inspirational quote books, you will love this one.  Rating: 4 stars.  Joseph J.
