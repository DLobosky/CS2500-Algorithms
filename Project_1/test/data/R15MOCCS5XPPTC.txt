I have this little book and love some of the patterns in it.  I've tatted for over 45 years and have also written a "learn how" book on the subject, Beginning Tatting:  A Lesson Book: Arts and Crafts Collection, yet I still collect pattern books like this one and have a large collection of them.  (In my opinion you can't have too many!) Even if you're an accomplished lace maker, there are new ideas, especially those for the use of tatting, that can add to your repertoire of patterns and techniques.
