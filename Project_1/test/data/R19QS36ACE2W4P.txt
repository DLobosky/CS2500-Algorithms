However after the first few episodes of season three, the show lost one of their main cast members. Robert Guillaume, who stole scene after scene in the first two seasons as Benson, left "Soap" to star in his own spin-off series titled (appropriately enough) "Benson". Certainly it was great to see Guillaume get his own show (and deservedly so), but in the process "Soap" lost a little of its comic touch without him. Nevertheless, the show for the most part continued to be very funny throughout season three. I just thought that the first two seasons were much funnier. Most of the other regular cast members returned, and two of the actors were honored with Emmy Awards for their work. Richard Mulligan and Cathryn Damon (as Burt and Mary Campbell) won lead acting Emmys in 1980 for their roles on the show. It was nice that "Soap" got a little bit of Emmy recognition in the four years that it aired. The year before in 1979, Robert Guillaume won a supporting Emmy for his role as Benson on "Soap" just as he was departing for "Benson" (Guillaume would eventually win another Emmy as a lead actor for "Benson" in 1985). "Soap" deserved the awards it got. It's too bad it didn't win more awards. This is a very funny and very entertaining sitcom.
