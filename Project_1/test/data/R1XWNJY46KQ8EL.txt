This movie proves great actors and stories can come from the Christian community.Besides the acting, the story itself is a winner. It is a very touching, emotional movie that will bring tears to your eyes.The Grace Card is full of hurting, blame, loss, forgiveness and sacrifice.The main story is when someone does something against you, you will forgive them and love them even if they don't ask-that's The Grace Card.My three youngest children 17, 18 and 20 watched it and approved it. They are hard to please, but have really loved it and will watch it again.The end of this movie is so fantastic and amazing you will be brought to tears.I give this the highest rating possible. A must see movie!"Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.
