It is an excellent likeness of the character, with very nice coloring and tons of detail.  The spacesuit has plenty of creases sculpted into it to give it a realistic appearance.  Since I'm choosing to display the figure in its packaging, I can only guess at its articulation, but it does appear to be limited: the arms appear moveable, and perhaps the head.  Medicom released its series of 19 POTA figures in the year 2000 and, as you might guess, they have become true collector's items.  These figures were made in China and one of the stick-on labels on the package is written in Chinese.  The rest of the packaging, however, is in English.  The back of the package features a photo of the Cornelius astronaut figure, the Milo astronaut figure, and The Greatest Ape (the Lawgiver statue.)POTA fans should love this figure and I strongly recommend it to collectors.
