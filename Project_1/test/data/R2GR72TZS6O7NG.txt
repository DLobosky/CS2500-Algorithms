As the other reviewer pointed out, the robber clothing will become de-shaped, loosened, unstable, slippery and frequently covering the buttons making them difficult to use.  $30 replacement for every year is ridiculous.  If this does not improve, the entire product would have questionable value as the pen itself is indispensable.An Update: If you are buying a Wacom pen separately for your Graphire tablet, get the new Bamboo Fun Pen instead. It also works with the Graphire tablets (CTE-xxx). I bought it to replace my less than two year old Graphire pen.  This is of much much better quality. Looks like Wacom has realized that it produced a terrible pen for an otherwise excellent tablet when they made the Graphires. I'm glad that Wacom made the new pens for the new Bamboo tablets compatible with the older Graphire tablets. So far, it seems 100% compatible and I've run into absolutely no issues. The new pen is better in all aspects. The buttons are much easier to access and are much better designed and made. And it lost the hated rubber cover.
