They tried to wrap Tora, Tora, Tora; From Here to Eternity and Thirty Seconds over Tokyo into one film..and failed miserably on all counts.Have you ever regretted buying a DVD ??  This is my situation... This is a sappy; historically inacurate, LONNNNNNG piece of filmmaking garbage... Like the previous reviewer, I couldn't watch the whole thing either...  Thank God, I have the new DVD of Guadalcanal Diary to fall back on.. I'm putting my Pearl Harbor DVD on ebay and hopefully I can recoup some of the cost...
