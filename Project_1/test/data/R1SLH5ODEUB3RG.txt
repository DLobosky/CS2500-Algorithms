The plot is a farce and Baron Ochs is a very annoying character and certainly not a funny one. But that is secondary, the two most important characters are Marschallin and Octavian, and in this production they are fabulous. Their development through the plot is what makes this opera great together with great music. The best of all is the last scene with Marschallin, Octavian and Sophie reflecting their souls into music. Far away from a comic situation, it is wonderfully realized with an almost static staging. Simply great!!The singers are good and act their roles well, but Anne Schwanewilms stands-up from the crowd, a real treat to listen to her and see her act in this introspective role (Marschallin).The staging is very well done and pleasing to watch. It is supposed to be set after WWII which makes some parts of the libretto seem awkward, but it does not distract from the plot and the music. This Blu-Ray disc is a joy to watch and to listen, although it appears that the sound is weak and you need to increase the volume much more than other similar discs. Strongly recommended.
