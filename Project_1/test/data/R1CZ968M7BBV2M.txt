It was again a fast pace with some very funny parts, but as a whole I felt it fell flat.  The premise of putting Sophie undercover at a high school was cute, maybe a bit of a stretch but these books are all in good fun.  However, the ending is what disappointed me!  I don't believe I am spoiling anything I say that the motive behind the crimes was ridiculous.  It just seemed silly and the wrap up was a bit too quick.  Also Sophie annoyed me a little in regard to the ongoing Sophie/Luke drama.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the pace so fast and I just had to keep reading.  It was the end, not the book as a whole that disappointed me.  Plus, I'm going to read #4.You can read this as a stand alone book even though it's part of a series.  It does involve the same characters and some of the storyline continues from book to book.
