This is a great horror movie. Good suspense, lots of blood and gore, everything a good horror film should have. So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? It was good, but not my favorite in the series. My favorite is Part 6: Jason Lives. This one comes in a close 2nd, though. If you're a fan of the series and you havn't seen this one, do yourself a favor and buy it.
