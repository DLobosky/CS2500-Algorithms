I've noticed some think the Batman movies were better with Tim Burton directing and Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.  While I preferred Keaton to Val Kilmer, this movie was 1) close enough to the original to fit in the series, and 2) was more likeable to me with Schumacher's approach.One thing that interested me in this movie were the villains.  Two Face never made it to the TV series I grew up with, but he was my favorite comic book villain.  The Riddler did not have much time in the comics that I saw, but I loved Frank Gorshin's Riddler from the TV series.Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face took me by surprise.  My impression of the comic character was more of a somber, sinister, intellectual man who was disfigured (and the animated Batman of the early '90's fit that image).  Jones portrayal was as over the top as Jack Nicholson's Joker.  I wasn't expecting it, but I liked it.As far as the Riddler:  my first impressions of Jim Carrey were negative (not based on seeing "In Living Color" or any of his previous movies, which I never watched), and thus I was disappointed to see he got the role.  Watching the movie, though, made me a fan of Carrey's.  Yes, I still like Gorshin's better, but this is close.There was only one thing I did not like about Kilmer's performance as Bruce Wayne, and that was his hair color (it did not matter after he put Batman's cowl on).  Kidman was great as the love interest.  Chris O'Donnell did an excellent job as Robin.  Drew Barrymore did okay in her small role.  Hinkle and Gough returned for round three, and fared as well as they did previously.As far as comparing the story with the comic book/TV series:  The series did not deal with the origins of Batman and Robin.  In the movie, Dick Grayson's family died as heroes, trying to save the lives of the circus audience from Two Face's bomb.  In the comics, I don't recall the same heroism in the deaths of the Graysons.  The first two movies clearly avoided any allusion to the TV series.  Not so with this one . . . there is a hilarious scene that makes fun of the TV Robin.This was my favorite of the three, and I would recommend it.  It has the action of the second movie, but it does not have the same gloominess of Burton's two movies.
