I brought a new Links wireless WRT160N from Walmart; sorry Amazon, router and have been trying to get it to work for the last 2 days; but it wouldn't connect, whatever I did. Finally, out of desperation,  I switched over to Firefox and EVERYTHING started working!!!!  My probelm all along had not been the new router or Network preferences, but SAFARI!!!  It was screwing things up.  I would recommend that if you are upgrading to a new 'N' router, stay away from Safari and use Firefox, to access your 192.168.1.1 Linksys page.  Webpages load super fastand everything is allot smoother.  I'm switching over to Firefox.I don't know what it is about Safari, but Linksys wireless router, definitely do not like it.
