I am not a movie critic and watch them only as entertainment so will leave the big trashing to others.  I bought this after watching it on Netflex. I have The Cutting Edge in my collection and decided to try this one. I thought it as good as the original without the sex and crude comments. Both actor and actress were great. Her big dark eyes and smile would melt the heart of any male from 15 to 80. The story line was about the same but I didn't feel it distracted from the movie as it was so well done. If you liked The Cutting Edge then try this one. I hope you will like it as much as I did. I watch them both about every one to two months when I need a good feeling fix.
