All of the Harry books are of consistently good quality, rather similar (Harry gets into trouble, there are misunderstandings, everybody gets along fine in the end).  This one follows the formula as well as any.  Harry just hates the shrill opera singing of the lady next door, and does everything he can to get her to shut up.  It's funny and our little boy liked it very much; we read it together many times.
