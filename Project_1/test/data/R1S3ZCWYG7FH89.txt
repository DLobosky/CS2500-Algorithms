Totally amazed with the top quality stool I received, and was totally assembled. Amazon was out of stools after my purchase of 24, so I saw another seller (Van***) with the Baxton Studio Veronica advertised and ordered 16 more............WOW ! ! What a nightmare arrived 3 weeks later. Wobbly,Puney,Poor Quality Reproductions made in China and comes in a box to be assembled.Buyers be VERY careful when making a purchase that is not sold and shipped by Amazon.
