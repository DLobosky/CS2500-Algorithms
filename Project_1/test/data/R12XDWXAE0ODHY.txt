This was a very fun movie, and though I did not see it in the movie theater, I have to say that I wish that I had now that I have seen it in my own home. The Director did a great job at developing great dynamics between the characters and the actors made the movie real (even though some of the situations were definitely over the top). On top of the comedy itself, there was also a great love story at the bottom of the plot which everyone will love as well. So get ready to laugh and have a good time as you watch this movie!
