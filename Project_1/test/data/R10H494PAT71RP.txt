Why won't Vizio fix their unstable base?  They have been using this terrible base design for over a year!I got a similar Vizio monitor (E370VL) with the same base. It was very unstable and tipped over, shattering the screen, which was quite fragile due to a very thin layer of glass (unlike most LCD computer screens). I checked several Vizio models in the store with this base and they were all very unstable compared to other brands.Either wall mount this or keep it somewhere it won't get bumped at all. Since many (if not most) people will use the base stand it comes with, I thought this was important to let people know. Very disappointed in this design.Recently, Vizio added this to many of their new manuals:"Use only with the cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table specified by manufacturer or sold with yourHDTV. When a cart is used, use caution when moving the cart/HDTV combination to avoid injuryfrom tip-over. Do not place your HDTV on an unstable cart, stand, or table. If your HDTV falls, itcan injure a person and cause serious damage to your HDTV."
