Stephanie Soechtig gives a behind-the-scenes approach to the bottled water industry that tries to control and profit off of this precious natural resource and the wastefulness of what happens to the P.E.T. bottles.75% of the planet is covered in water, but only 1% is drinkable. America's largest bottled water corporations are bottling our natural waters everyday and selling it back at 1900% of the cost of tap water. Some states like Maine, California, and Michigan are fighting back and are in trials with Nestle, the bottler of Poland Springs water for the rights to their community water.When so many documentaries focus on our dwindling natural resources, the loss of water would be much more frightening than oil. The truth that these companies like Nestle, Coca Cola, and Pepsi don't want you to realize is that bottled water is not cleaner, purer, or more healthy than tap water. They do not come from magical natural springs but from the same public sources as tap water. It is a completely unnecessary cost to the consumer budget that creates more waste and hurts communities that live around the refineries from pollution.The question left to be asked is how much of these facts are scare tactics and how much is a valid threat that needs to be acted upon immediately? Concern about waste, the environment, and the health of people in our community is certainly very important, but it would be very difficult to convince our country that more attention needs to be paid to water when it is so focused on oil. It is sad, but true! I encourage you to check out this documentary which I fear might not get as much attention as it deserves without grassroots word-of-mouth behavor. It is AMAZING how many people purchase bottled water when a filter on their faucet would work just as well and be cheaper in the long run. Bottled water is a luxury item, there are water fountains everywhere you go and it is much more environmentally sound to buy one reusable bottle and take it wherever you go.This DVD comes in an environmentally friendly slim case much like its predecessor, "An Inconvenient Truth" among others. It has won awards at several international film festivals including Honolulu in 2010, Anchorage in 2009, Eugene in 2009, and Charleston in 2009 as well as the Best of Fest award at the Colorado Environmental Film Festival in 2009.Bonus Features:It is AMAZING how many people purchase bottled water when a filter on their faucet would work just as well and be cheaper in the long run.

This just goes to show the abundance of information that Stephanie Soechtig and her team dug up on anything and everything related to the water before channeling the focus of the film to keep her audience on track. These are all interesting subjects on their own, but they do veer off the path of the most direct message she was aiming for and makes a lot of sense that these were edited out.
