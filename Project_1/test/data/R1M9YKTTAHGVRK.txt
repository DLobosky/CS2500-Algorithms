What About Bob is one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, and one of Bill Murray's best roles as the neurotic Bob Wiley, who seeks help from renowned psychiatrist Dr Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss). As Leo's patient, Bob follows Leo to his holiday house at Lake Winnapasokee, where the crazy Bob pesters his exasperated Doc for answers to his problems. The gradually- increasing craziness between Dreyfuss and Murray is fantastic, with an outstanding script and superb comedic timing.The film also stars Julie Hagerty (Airplane) as Leo's wife and Charlie Korsmo (from Spielberg's Hook) as Sigmund 'Siggy' Marvin. But this movie belongs to Murray. His brilliant comic timing and neuroticism provide some great laughs (&quot;I want, I want, gimme, gimme, gimme, I need I need!&quot;).  Which is exactly what people are saying about this DVD. Must-have comedy.
