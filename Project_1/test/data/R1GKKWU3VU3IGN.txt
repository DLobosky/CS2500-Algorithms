Gypsy Handheld Design Studio for CricutI have two Cricuts, the recently discontinued Coluzzle System, a Yudu and some other provocraft products that work great. In hindsight, I did not read enough of the reviews on the Gypsy in the Cricut Community boards before I ordered the Gypsy. I got caught-up in the frenzy of trying to get a Gypsy from HSN before they ran out again. BTW, I do not have a problem with HSN -- rather provocraft (yes, that lower-case "p" is intentional).There are "oodles" of people who are very happy with their Gypsies -- but if you research and read, you will see that there are plenty of purchasers who are not. So that I avoid sounding like a lone-nut, I won't go into any details about the problems that I experienced with the Gypsy. Rather, I will encourage you to go to the Cricut homepage and visit the community boards. Join (it's worth it), then search/filter on Gypsy and go to the tech forums.As for me, I am returning this product to HSN for a refund as defective.  After fairly extensive -- albeit LATE reading about provocraft customer service, I will not be sending the Gypsy to provocraft for repair. The Gypsy is potentially a great gadget and a fantastic concept but.   I can see where it could become addictive because it is sooo freakin' cute and portable. I really want one -- but one that works.  Unfortunately, it has been my experience that the quality and stability of the Gypsy are currently hit-or-miss.  Even with "4 interest-free monthly payments", $300 is too much to pay for an inconsistent,  battery operated paperweight.  Congratulations to those who got good ones.  Yes, I read and followed the instructions carefully and treated it with kid-gloves.  I even sat through an hour + call with provocraft customer service to diagnose the problems.  Provocraft admitted the devices were defective.  I want one but I'll wait until this sucker has been on the market for at least a year.  Oh -- and don't be too enamoured with the "exclusive" totebag offered with the Gypsy. You can find very cute purse-styled camera bags that are much more attractive should you decide to buy a Gypsy.  Happy crafting!Gypsy by Cricut personal design studio with Accessories
