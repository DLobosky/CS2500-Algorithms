However, the twists this novel takes to get you there will have your jaw dropping.Those that enjoy the J.D. Robb series will notice similarities between Ladd's Nick and Claire with Robb's Roarke and Eve, but the characters in this series are unique in their own right - and live in real time, not the future.Looking forward to the second installment - and hoping to see more of the really sexy Nicky.-- Angela Wilson
