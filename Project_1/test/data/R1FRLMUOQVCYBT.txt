THE FACTS OF LIFE was a sitcom that was a spinoff of DIFFERENT STROKES regarding the Drummond's former maid Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who takes a job as the housemother at an all-girls only private school boarding facility called Eastland School in Peekskill, New York who took care of 4 girls which were the spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), the obese, but impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest and gossipy Dorothy "Tootie" Ramsay(Kim Fields).Eventually, Blair and Jo had graduated from the Eastland Academy in the 4th Season Finale in the Spring of 1983 and in the Fall of 1983 Mrs. G and the girls had all moved out of Eastland School and into a house next to where Mrs. Garrett starts a business of her own called "Edna's Edibles" and had Blair, Jo, Tootie, and Natalie working for her at the shop.This 1985-86 Season is the season when THE FACTS OF LIFE was moved to Saturdays in the Fall of 1985 and when Edna's Edibles was burned to the ground and was rebuilt the store into a pop culture-influenced gift shop that the girls all ran together and had won the timeslot over its frequent rivals such as AIRWOLF on CBS and BENSON on ABC.This 1985-1986 Season was also the season when Mackenzie Austin joins the cast as the orphaned Andy Moffett and Cloris Leachman joins the cast as Edna's sister(Beverly Ann Stickle)who takes over the new shop.This season also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was "Let's All Be There" and to when I was 13 years old in the 7th grade and when I used to watch this show on Saturday nights at 8:30 PM before watching GOLDEN GIRLS at 9PM.
