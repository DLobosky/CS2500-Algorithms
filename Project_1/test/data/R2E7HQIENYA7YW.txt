I bought this shirt along with the 2010 on Brown with the African Colors (see review on that page-same company) and I absolutely love it. I was going to get an official Adidas World Cup Tee but in my Amazon search I came across these and loved the design of the other shirt and decided to buy this one too. I am a 2X but can fit an XL and it fits fairly true to size, it is roomy in the body and is on the long end for a 2X but not longer than expected for a 2X.  The only thing about the size that was a bit unusual was the sleeves are on the short size and takes a bit getting used to but is still quite comfortable. The only negative say is that the YELLOW color you see in the product photo, if your monitor is fairly accurate, is really nice and looks polished but the actual shirt is more of a mustard yellow, just as the "Dijon" in the DESCRIPTION READS and feels great but does not look the same...the silk screen design is perfectly represented and I highly recommend this shirt.
