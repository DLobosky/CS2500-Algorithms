I've had this calculator since junior school, and its still more than enough, at least for freshman+ level college math/physics/chemistry courses.One of the best features of this calculator is its programming language. If you need a function that is not built in, program it yourself! For example, I've written a 3D graphing program that enables me to graph objects in 3D, and it has been very useful.Not that the built in functions are not impressive. Although the 89 has many more functions, most are not necessary, at least not for the higher price. The 83 has all the basic calculator functions you would expect, and need. There are literly hundreds of functions built into it. Its graphing ability is especially robust, with full zooming capability, tracing, value table listings..etc.It is also extremely durable. I've dropped it more times than I can remember, but it has still survived without a dent.All in all, I highly recommand this great calculator.
