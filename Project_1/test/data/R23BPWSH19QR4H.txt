Since Peter Drucker first popularized the idea of business strategy, there have been vastly more strategies conceived than there have been strategies successfully implemented.  Much attention has been paid to devising better  strategies, and little to implementing strategies. The big pay-off is in  the implementation, and THE BALANCED SCORECORE hits a home run in showing  how to explain what needs to be done to successfully execute strategy.  You  must have more measures, and different measures than the accounting system  provides.  You also need to link measures to the key tasks that each person  must perform.  This book is simply the Rosetta Stone of communicating and  managing strategy.  THE BALANCED SCORECARD is the beginning of the  practical period of maturity in the field of business strategy.  Read this  book today to enjoy much more prosperity!
