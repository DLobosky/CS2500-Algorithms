I think students would enjoy these books that are specifically geared toward their interests. For those who are still learning, these are probably best for teen or adult learners. These books are fun and not too difficult, though not really meant for little kids. There are crosswords, matching games, picture games, etc. and you can work on a puzzle that is somewhat challenging, working your way up to very challenging. My only complaint is that they could have had just a little more instruction for those who are very new to signing, or for kids, and it would be fun for a wider audience. This is the only reason I gave it four stars. Using both of these books has been an interesting way to boost my ASL knowledge and help me find new ways to test those skills besides simple memorization. I definitely recommend them once you have a little understanding of ASL.
