If you ask ten movie fans what their favorite David Fincer movie is, eight are probably going to say 'Fight Club.'  I am one of the minority.  Seven is not only my favorite Fincher movie, but it is one of my favorite movies ever.  It is so much more than a crime drama.  It is nothing short of a masterpiece.Seven follows two detectives, the calm, wise, and soon to retire Somerset (Freeman) and the young, gifted hotshot Mills (Pitt).  These two, opposite personalities arrive at the scene of a particularly grisly murder of a morbidly obese man.  I will not disclose details, but the killings are reminiscent of the style shown in "Silence of the Lambs" and years later, "Saw".  During a second inspection of the crime scene, prompted by plastic shavings found in the stomach of the dead man, "gluttony" is found carved into the wall behind the refrigerator.  Soon after, a lawyer turns up dead in another bizzare murder, and "greed" is spelled out in his own blood on the carpet.  The killer chooses victims who embody the Seven Deadly Sins.  Somerset and Mills take the case.  They pick up on the pattern and know that the killer will strike agian and follow his trail.  It becomes evident early on that this is no ordinary killer, though.  He has every move plotted well in advance, and his killings make a stark commentary on the flaws of society today.  He uses each victim's sin as the central instrument in his elaborate, almost artistic executions.  He offers an alternate and thought provoking viewpoint on justice.  It makes the viewer think more than any standard fare thriller ever would.  The ending is superb as well.  Don't listen to any of the other reviews, it comes as a complete shock.  I really want to go more in depth on the plot, but it would be doing this movie an injustice to give away too much.  Just know that different than the rest of the crime movies you have ever seen, and so chilling and thought provoking.  It is scary not because it is overly gory, nor is it scary due to cheesy special effects.  Seven is frightening because the events in the world represented in the film could all too easily be real, and that is an entirely different type of fear.The Final Word - An absolutely amazing movie that will floor you with it's originality and intelligence.  Nihlistic and frightening, it is mainstream cinema at its absolute best.  It suceeds in every way imaginable.  A must have for any true movie fan.
