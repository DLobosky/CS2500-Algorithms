This happens to the original black and blue toners. After I replaced them, the problem went away for only a few hundred pages. Then it came back for black toner. I checked the manual and found that we have to clean two areas. One is the drum unit. It produces equally spaced stains on the page. The other is the spill of the toner. I have to constantly clean it.Brother has a unique design that toner cartridges and drum units are separate. So you don't have to replace them all together like other brands. . All the Brother color printers share this design. They all use the same toner cartridges and drum units. It apparently reduces the production cost greatly. But it seems to me that with this design toner cartridges and drum units are very flimsy. I have done the cleaning of toner carriages and drum unit so many times that I can do that without taking out the drum unit. I never have to do this to other laser printers. And I never know so much detail about laser printers before I own a Brother printer.If unfortunately you own one and would like to keep it, the other thing you have to watch out is the cost of toner. It will stop working after a preset number of pages even you still have a lot of toner in it. You can follow the instruction below to reset the toner cartridge. It will save you a lot of money.Amazon won't let me post the url. Please search the web for the instruction. You have to open the cap and turn back the wheel in the cartridge. Good luck.
