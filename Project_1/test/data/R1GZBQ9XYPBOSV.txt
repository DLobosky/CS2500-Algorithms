When I bought the dvd of this film, a friend saw the dvd on my room and looked at the cover and the back of the box. She thought the Beach would be a romantic love story that takes place on a Beach, and that the movie would be all fun. I warned her that the Beach had a romance story in the film, but that the story is more of a Thriller than a sweet romance film. So people, be warned: don't expect only butterflies and sweet romance, cause then the Beach will be one big shock to you.The Beach is a film that follows a young Backpacker called Richard (perfectly played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who travels through Thailand, looking for adventure. He meets a man in a hotel who gives him a map to a secret beach where life is perfect and beautiful. Together with two French friends, Richard goes in search of this magical beach and finds it. But he soon finds out that the perfect life doesn't excist at all...The beach is a nice, almost warm film with some Thrilling moments for the first hour. You will be entertained and thrilled by tense situations and the most beautiful locations. The Beach itself almost feels like a character in the movie. The locations in the film are some of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. Although the first part of the film has some dark moments, it shows how great paradise can be.Now the second half of the film is very dark and moody. Be warned, cause there is alot of blood and alot of shocking moments.That's what made me dislike the Beach for the first time I saw it. The first hour was great, magical and fun to see. The second half was shocking and a realistic look on life that made me not look at the film for a long time. But now, after I've seen it again a few times, I realise that the Beach is a perfect film for Thriller lovers, a perfect film for people who like Adventure movies, for people who love Drama films, and for people who just love to see a good film.The Beach is now one of those films I like having in my collection: it has grown on me over the years.The technical elements of the film are fantastic. Great cameramovements, great lighting and great effects. It all flows perfectly and defenitly entertains. Congrats to the director who has done a great job creating a story in a kind of way that keeps you watching.The acting is also of a high level and shows that DiCaprio can also play a shocking character next to a heroic romantic character. The man can act for sure. Virginie Ledoyen is absolutely stunning and drop dead gorgious in this film. She acts great and is part of the beautiful aspects of this film for sure. The rest of the cast which includes Robert Carlyle (acting great in a shocking role) and Guillaume Canet (who does a good job as &Eacute;tienne) all act fine. So don't you worry about the the acting bringing the movie down, cause thats not the case in this film.Now, the Beach has become a great film with a pleasing result, which is a great acquisition in your moviecollection if you are a fan of thrillers, drama, DiCaprio or Ledoyen. But beware: it's not all pleasant sunshine in this film.Prepare to see whats paradise is all about and what the exact opposite of it is.
