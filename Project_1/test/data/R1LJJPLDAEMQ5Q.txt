I mentioned in my review of 50 Ways to Hex Your Lover how much I liked Nick, but he's even hotter in Hex Appeal. He's so sexy, so strong, and so supportive of Jazz and her quirks. There are quite a few more love scenes in this book than in the first as well, and they're smokin' hot. The romance is also more present and more believable in this book, and the ending is quite a bit closer to a true HEA than the "Happy For Now" ending in the first book.Linda writes great characters. The entire cast of characters in this book is amazing, from ghostly Irma and the shoes that are actually living creatures, to Jazz's witchy friends and the sexy geek roommate Krebs.The villain in this book is scary awesome, and way cooler and more involved in the story than the villain in the first book. The dream sequences are really creepy and good, and Jazz goes through some pretty terrible but funny things while she hunts for the creep polluting her dreams. The secondary plot that has Fluff and Puff accused of murder is cute too, and I wish it had been developed a little more. I love the werecreatures that were introduced into the Fluff and Puff storyline. I hope Coby the werewolf spends more time on the scene in the third book. He's dark and sexy and I'd really love to learn more about him.As much as I enjoyed this book, I still had a couple more problems with it than with the first. I felt really lost a lot of the time during the book. I kept having the feeling that I was missing something really important, even though I had just finished the first book in the series a few days earlier. It was easier to forgive this aspect in the first book because I thought it might be cleared up in the second, but it wasn't. In fact, there were even more loose threads and more characters with unexplained backgrounds in Hex Appeal than there were in 50 Ways to Hex Your Lover. The characters in this series are so fun and so interesting that I couldn't help but want to get to know them. Jazz and Nick have some really fascinating friends. Even the bad guys are cool in these stories. I really felt like I was missing out by not knowing more about their history.My other quibble is more of a personal preference than something I feel like I can deduct review points for, but I never really felt like the ruling bodies and the leading witches were on Jazz's side, and I never understood that. I can't see how anything she's done should cause her to lose the support of her own teachers and leaders. Anyway, like I said, a personal thing. I'm a geeky psychological person that wants to get into everyone's head, and it always bugs me when I don't "get" a person. That's a very minor gripe, and it probably won't even register with most other readers.Other than these two little issues, this is a great book. I had a hard time finding any actual flaws in the writing or in the world building (other than loose ends), which is unusual for me. Ms. Wisdom is clearly a very talented and experienced writer, and it shows in her work.I may have a few more quibbles with this book than with the first book, but it's still a lot of fun and the positives far outweigh the negatives. Hex Appeal is a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed getting to know Jazz and the gang. I haven't read many witch romances, and these books make me want to hunt for a few more.I definitely recommend this book to fans of urban fantasy and paranormal chick lit with light romance. This book is a blast. But don't forget to read 50 Ways to Hex Your Lover first. Hex Appeal will make a lot more sense that way.
