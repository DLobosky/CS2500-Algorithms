I have not heard this recording and base my rating on reading about public reaction to the first performances in Salt Lake City. It would be great if someone would release this performance on CD.Journal of Book of Mormon Studies: Volume - 8, Issue - 2, Pages: 4-13. Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 1999:Salt Lake City, 1953: Studio Records, produced by Allen Duff Associates (i.e., Allen Jensen of KSL Radio and Marion Duff Hanks), 5303-RC long play, featuring the Utah Symphony, University of Utah Choruses, and soloists: D&eacute;sir&eacute; Ligeti, Harold Bennett, Kenly W.
