I thought this movie was going to be a boring biographical film, I was wrong.  Aside from missing some content I feel should be in the movie, this is one of the best biographical films I've seen.  I feel there were parts excluded from the Dalai Lama's life that shouldn't have been.  However, they covered the Dalai Lama's life from a baby until he moved to India very well.  Judging from outside research they did a very good job &quot;sticking to the script&quot;.  I think they captured the setting and mood of the Dalai Lama and his people very well.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Tibet and/or the Dalai Lama.
