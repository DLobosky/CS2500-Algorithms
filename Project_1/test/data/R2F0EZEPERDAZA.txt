Being that it takes place mostly on a space station, there is little exploration here. Instead this tries to be a darker show and focus more on politics and intrigue. There is a looming war threat that spans most of the seasons and finally plays out. Overall its pretty well done, and there are some great episodes. However, in my opinion the cast of main characters was not as great as the other Star Trek shows, and I just didn't enjoy the show as much as the others. It does however have a large cast of side characters, (more then any other show I can think of) that make frequent appearances throughout the span of the show. The collection is the individual seasons and the packaging is not very good.
