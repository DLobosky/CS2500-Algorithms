This review does not relate to the movie, but it is focused on the ridiculous process to download the digital copy.  After creating accounts for both Flixster and Ultraviolet, linking the accounts, enabling WB to view my personal information, the system hangs and doesn't download the movie.  I contacted Ultraviolet first with the issues and error messages.  After a day, I was told this is not an Ultraviolet issue, but a Flixster problem.  I then contacted Flixster.  They responded by sending me to the FAQ.  To date, I have not gotten a proper response from Flixster on the error messages.  I plan on canceling both accounts and will NEVER buy another DVD tied to Ultraviolet.  This is a complete rip off and WB should be ashamed of this dreadful service. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy the movie with the digital copy.  If you want a digital version, just got to iTunes.
