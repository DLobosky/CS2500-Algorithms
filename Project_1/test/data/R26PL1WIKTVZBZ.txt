When I couldn't get Easy Riders to play and the sound was bad on Tender Mercies, I reluctantly pulled Le Samourai out of the bottom of the bag.  Sometimes it's better to be surprised.I am not a cineaste so I couldn't compare this film with those of Tarantino or whoever else various readers here are discussing.  So don't expect a technical analysis here; others have done that. I just liked it! Melville states in an interview with him that he considers it essential to please the audience; a film must entertain. Another film critic stated that this was a tremendous box office success in France when it came out.  So, don't be put off by all of the high-flying discussions--it is a lot of fun to watch.  Fun may be an odd word for a film noir but I found it so cleverly constructed and with such a sense of meticulous irony that, yes, it was fun. There are parts where he does seem to be parodying himself but that is part of the fun. He is a tremendously smart and clever man.The idea of presenting a modern day Parisian hit-man as a samurai is fascinating.  The hero, or anti-hero, Jeff Costello, portrayed to perfection by Alain Delon, is the epitome of self-containment, as a samuri must be.  One can only imagine the depths of his loneliness as we see him move through life, never dropping his mask like expression.  Only when he is dressing a gun shot wound in his bathroom do we see the muscles in his face relax.  Even with his sometime girlfriend, played by Nathalie Delon, he rarely drops his guard. A beautiful Black jazz pianist in a nightclub where he has been hired to kill the owner seems to  get through to him in  some mysterious way.  We don't even know her name and their relationship is unclear.  (Melville explains in the interview that he likes to leave the audience a little confused about what happened.) The way his eyes seer into hers in the closest thing we see to some deep human emotion.  (She is wonderfully played by Caty Rosier in a performance that totally wipes out that of Nathalie Delon, in my opinion.)The story is fascinating.  It is set in Paris of 1967, when the film was made and it's thorougly enjoyable to see the trappings of that time and place.  There are some terrific scenes in the Metro which should bring back memories to anyone who has ever tried to navigate the underground rail system. The nightclub with the Courrege style decor is fun to see. Mostly it's a character study.  We don't know anything of the background of this mysterious guy...no case study of what drove him to crime. His personality is totally submerged beneath his handsome, glossy surface, dressed in perfectly tailored suits and the requisite beige trench coat and fedora.  Only a tiny bird in an antique cage shows that there is a real human being sharing the space of his monochromatic gray apartment. I don't want to tell too much to spoil the enjoyment of the story unfolding.  Warning:  some of the reviews do spoil the ending...so be careful what you read if you haven't seen the film.  I think it is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels.  It has been revolving around in my brain ever since I saw it.  The interviews with Melville, Delon and others are good for those who want to think about it, but for others, it can simply be enjoyed as a good exciting film. I'm definitely going to look for more of Melville's work.
