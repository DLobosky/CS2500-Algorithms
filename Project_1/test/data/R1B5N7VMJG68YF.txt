

Eleven:Eleven is an amazing album. Every song is a dark and intense stew of hellish blues, relentlessly driven by an aggressive double-guitar attack---all anchored by a rhythm section capable of starting and stopping on a dime.If that doesn't work for you try this: it's what would have happened if Pink Floyd recorded Animals on heroin instead of acid.If it's not available here, try to get it from Matador directly or from your local used music shop. Definitely worth the effort of seeking it out.
