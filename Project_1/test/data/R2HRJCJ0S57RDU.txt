Why is that so many good battle histories lack decent maps?  The maps in this book, to use a adjective favored by my grandchildren,[are bad].  Prange's prose is dense and detailed and the absence of good maps limits the ability of the reader to understand him.        This is a good book -- maybe the best about Midway, the most important battle of the Pacific War.  People these days seem to forget that in 1942, Americans were probably more worried about Japan than they were about Germany.        Prange tells the story of Midway from both the Japanese and the American side.  The insights from military leaders -- now virtually all dead -- make this an irreplacable source of information on the battle.  I suggest a new deluxe edition of this book -- rewritten in places to improve the comprehensibility of the prose and with detailed maps, timelines, a glossary of military terms, and more photos of the battle and the equipment in use.  I would like to see, for example, photos of the many different aircraft participating in the battle.
