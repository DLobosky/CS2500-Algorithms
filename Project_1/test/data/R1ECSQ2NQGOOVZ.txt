I have read many of the Inspector Ian Rutledge novels, but have not necessarily tried to read them in order.  This one was first published in 2007, and the series has gotten considerably better since this book came out.Rutledge is ordered by Chief Superintendent Bowles to leave a case he is working on in London to go immediately to the small town of Hampton Regis on the south coast.  A telephone message has come in to Scotland Yard that a situation has developed there with hostages taken and the man will only speak to Rutledge.  What he finds when he arrives is that the trouble is just beginning for everyone in this small town.This series of stories set in England just after the end of World War I has been a favorite of mine since I fist discovered them.  Sadly this particular book did not live up to the standards set in other Rutledge novels.  For one thing, the hostage situation was completely unbelievable.  After all, who was the one in charge of that situation?  Why did Rutledge allow Stephen Mallory, the man holding two women hostage, to dictate what would and would not happen in the unfolding situation?  And that went on for days.  It really was a circumstance which did not even come close to feeling believable.  There are all the usual characters from a small village represented in the novel including policemen, nosy women, village gossips, the local doctor and his wife, the local clergyman, people who had moved down from London, many characters with secrets and "a past", and local fishermen, but I never seemed to feel much empathy or even compassion for any of them.  One particularly noticeable phrase was used four times in the novel ("like all the imps of hell") and that simply doesn't usually happen in a Charles Todd novel.  It was very disconcerting to see it so many times because it seemed to go along with all the other things which just kept repeating over and over, as if the authors had simply run out of ideas and had to recycle what had worked pretty well so far in the book.This novel will not be counted as one of my favorite Inspector Rutledge stories in the series, but I am glad that I read it.  It had a slightly different feeling to it, almost the same as previous books yet not quite.  By having Mallory be one of the soldiers who was in France and under Rutledge's command we were able to find out some new bits of information regarding what Rutledge and Hamish MacLeod went through during the fighting.  Rutledge is still fighting to gain control over his shell shock suffered in the war, and the voice of Hamish is very active within his mind in the book.  If you are new to the series, I would suggest starting with a more recent book, perhaps The Red Door: An Inspector Rutledge Mystery (Ian Rutledge Mysteries) or A Lonely Death.  Both are excellent stories and will give you a very firm understanding of the mental relationship going on between Rutledge and Hamish - the fatality which haunts Rutledge night and day.
