End result - a lot of dead people that are up and walking around. How did this happen? Well, it looks like everyone is blaming you and some of the survivors and, amongst your critics, the military. Solution - hang around and figure this out while staying alive and handing out some much need lovin'.I'm not going to pick a system or try to turn this into one being better than the other. I love my 360 and that is that. I'm sure PS3 owners feel the same way about their stuff. I'm glad we can all experience the game. This is a lot like the last one in some ways, too, only there are some beautiful little things that have come a long, long way since the inception. First, you have that same safety area. You get calls and you run missions and you field a lot fo traffic. The GREAT thing is that the AI isn't stupid this time. In the first DRing, they stood and let themselve be gobbled up without you. Now, they run and you run, and that makes things good. I'm not saying that this is a perfect world - far from it - but it is a great thing that has gone well beyond what I expected.You level up just like before, and you get some of the same stuff. Streength, speed, health blocks, item bnlocks; you name all that stuff and it appears. The difference now is that it is a lot more interesting in the way you level. You get your player points all sorts of ways: you can kill, complete missions, play little games, and dabble in mall materials. There's a lot to do in a Casino with malls literally glued everywhere. The place is HUGE.One difference is the combo weapons, where you make somethingf rom two or more items. The first thing I got was a spiked bat, which is a nail and bat creation. Then I got a drill bucket - and I don't want to ruin it or the others that came after. Basically the game just added a new element and that is pretty. Player likes.Another thing I like is the ability to aim. When I find something and want to hit someone with it, I can. Arrows, lawn darts, bullets; it isn't like the last go. you can actually put the projectile in the face of that lovely shambling mess and think "i AM good at this." You can also utilize your moves and getyyourself out of jams, making even button mashers have a chance to get out alive. It takes and makes something that all expereince levels can exjoy while rewarding you for getting better or trying harder. Tjhose bosses - some of them are jsut plain evil.There is a lot in this game and it is easy to keep on keeping on. you are a different person, you know that right aweay, and have different needs. I dso have to say that not having the camera was weird at first, but the mall and the amazing size of this establishment just boggled our minds. We got an early release so this has been a week of playing, too, and thwere are only minor glitches as well. I've had tweo that had zombies take me out after they were gone and one stick me in a wall. Still, with all the hours I've logged, its a fair shake.Gore - yes. Fun - yes. What I expected - a lot more. i know some people might find a fault here or there, but judging it fairly will show just how beautiful this game is. The snozberries taste like snozberries! It is a great, great thing and I hope you pikc it up regardless of what you thought of the first. It will keep giving and has more story than before. for the multiplayer reviewing, I am not the person to say if this is great and admit it. So, that is one thing I have to say that I cannot provide much detail on. Still, I'm sure an ocean of reviews will come out and you can find out as much as you want. Turn to the editorial piece if you need more on what is what there and take a look at those zombies and note how good they are depicted. In my wildest dreams, I didn't think I would see thousands of beautifully rendered teeth chomping that chomp and yet I did. It is well in the 5/5.
