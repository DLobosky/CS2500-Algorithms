&quot;The Snares of Death&quot; is the second, and one of the best, in Kate Charles' delightful Book of Psalms series. Readers who like English-cozy mysteries, especially those with a Church of England setting,  will find much to enjoy here. There is never a dull moment, with continual  goings-on involving the High Church vs. Low Church controversy,  animal-rights activists, lots of interesting and likable characters, and a  very unlikable murder victim.
