My problem with this book is one that has been stated by a couple other reviewers:  Is it reliable as a source of what actually went through the people's minds and hearts during the era and in the locale in question as its author and its proselytes proclaim it to be? - My answer is, in a word, &quot;No.&quot;  No book can accomplish this feat.  But that doesn't mean that attempts such as this one can't be &quot;beautiful as shipwrecks from paradise,&quot; to borrow from Shelley.   To cut to the chase, what the book succeeds in doing is not in demarking the Middle Ages from the Renaissance, but in contrasting the Middle Ages (as Huizinga would like to see them anyway) with Huizinga's own age.  I'm not going to belabor the point, just one citation will suffice: On page 235,Huizinga asseverates, &quot;There was no great truth of which the medieval mind was more certain than those words from the Corinthians, 'For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.'  They never forgot that everything would be absurd if it exhausted its meaning in its immediate function and form of manifestation, and that all things extend in an important way to the world beyond.&quot;  Really now?  How does he know this?  Has he conducted extensive interviews with the illiterate serfs whose lifetimes were a fraction of ours and who spent their waking hours trying to keep food in their bellies?  What Huizinga is describing here is a mystical perception of the world prevalent among poets and mystically inclined philosophers throughout all ages and lands.  Huizinga's own citation of Corinthians undermines the notion that this view was exclusive to the Middle Ages....But it's a beautiful picture nonetheless, though it be untrue to the reality.In conclusion, Huizinga is a poetic, artistic historian, and the insights in this book are such as one would expect given this approach: Fascinating, richly textured, but, well, not verifiable or entirely true in many cases.  Enjoy.  But you may want to hang your critic's hat on a medieval peg somewhere.  Surely you have one.
