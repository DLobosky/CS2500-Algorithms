WHAT ABOUT BOB is one of the funniest (and most underrated) comedies ever and one of my favourite movies. The master of craziness Bill Murray has one of his best roles as the neurotic Bob Wiley, who seeks help from renowned psychiatrist Dr Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss). As Leo's patient, Bob follows him to his holiday house at Lake Winnapisokee, where the crazy Bob pesters his exasperated Doc for answers to his problems. Directed with aplomb by Frank &quot;Yoda&quot; Oz, the witty back-and-forth and gradually increasing craziness between Dreyfuss and Murray is fantastic, with an outstanding script and superb comedic timing. It's also one of the few comedies that stands to repeat viewings to catch the numerous gags.The film also stars Julie Hagerty (Airplane) as Leo's wife and Charlie Korsmo (from Steven Spielberg's Hook) as Sigmund 'Siggy' Marvin. But this movie belongs to Murray. Only betterd by his brilliant Phil Conners in GROUNDHOG DAY, his neuroticism provides some great laughs (&quot;I want, I want, gimme, gimme, gimme, I need I need!&quot;). Which is exactly what people are saying about this DVD. Must-have comedy.
