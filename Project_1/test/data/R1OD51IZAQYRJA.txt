Good plot and sub plots involving Eric (a pushy and manipulative master vampire), the Shreveport weres, the panther shifters and a couple good sex scenes.  Some humor as when Sookie's brother (a long time Tom Cat becomes one in reality).  Good fun and still good characters a fine read without silly trappings that detract from the storey.
