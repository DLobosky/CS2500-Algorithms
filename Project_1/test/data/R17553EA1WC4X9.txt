I totally agree with all the other reviewers, especially the review from &iexcl;§superpope_dot_com's.&iexcl;¨ Indeed, it is criminal for Disney to hold such great films and not share them with the people in The States. The marketing people at Disney have no vision at all.Me too, I've gotten the Castle in the Sky on DVD from Japan Town long time ago. What a wonderful film. And I think I know why the Disney does not release it until now. Because the Atlantis and the Treasure Island (the wannabes of the Castle in the Sky) were big failures and box office luck busters, and the Spirited Away has claimed a huge critical and monetary success. Now they finally open their short-sighted eyes, knowing they have the real gems, which are far much better than their own copycat products and try to tap in to Miyazaki&iexcl;¦s master pieces after all that.
