This is a wireless iPod accessory dock to combine with an existing Sonos Wireless Music system or to go along with a newly purchased Sonos system.This item took me 9 minutes from opening the box to listening to music on my iPod Nano.  It was a breeze.  After unpacking I plugged it in and read the 3 step directions.  I grabbed my Sonos Controller, pressed a Sync button on the back of the dock and updated my system wirelessly. The next thing I knew I had an icon for my iPod with my songs, playlists, etc.  Easy and simple just the way the Sonos system is.I can now zone the music together-so I can play that music from my iPod in multiple rooms (only the same music) at the same time, or play iPod in one room and Pandora in another.  Of course it does this with a low profile-the item is very small like most accessory docks and also while charging your iPod.  I can play the songs on the iPod, Playlists, artists, etc.  I have also tried the dock with my iPhone 3G and it worked well-although it does take 30 seconds or so to sort of "read" whatever iPod you dock.  You can also play music while you search for other playlists to artists within the iPod that you want to listen to.The fidelity is very impressive.  I have some floor standing B & W Speakers connected to a higher end Yamaha amp and the music  sounds great-better than Pandora through Sonos-and Pandora sounds pretty darn good.  I also an running it through a Denon Amp and some Gallo a 'Diva Speakers that sound great as well.  Apparently the dock takes the music right off of your iPod vs. converting it to analog-which is huge for original sound integrity.  I found this to be the case.UPDATE:  I have now had this dock for 5 days and still love it.  There is question as to why one would need this if their iTunes is already synced with Sonos and a thought is that if you have others that visit your house often-they can bring their iPod and sync it with your Sonos.  An example would be if you have a significant other not living with you or Mother/Father that have different musical tastes.  The dock itself has volume +/- on the side and a sync button on the back.  Note that the sync can be easily accidentally pressed when trying to move this dock-as my wife did when she was cleaning the countertop.  It will sort of re-set the iPod and dock again and your music will not play properly until it has reset itself fully.  Just something to get used to once you know it's there.  One sized dock should fit all iPod except the Shuffle.I love theSonos system and left a review for it several months ago singing its praises but a critical comment I made of it was that I thought I was supposed to be able to wirelessly connect my Mac and iTunes to the Sonos system and always access my music library.  I have not been able to do this after quite a bit of trying but admit to not calling their tech support.  I have been resigned to listening to my iTunes via wired LAN connection-essentially my MAC hooked up wired to one of my Sonos 120's or 90's but now I no longer have to do that.  My Mac can be off, it can be with my wife away from home or it can simply be in my lap and not plugged in to the wired connection-but I can still access all my iTunes music library that is stored on the iPod docked to this new item.For it's price point-this is a must have for anyone that has an existing Sonos system and doesn't have an ideal set-up to hear their iTunes library whenever they want.  The fact that it charges the iPod and also plays the music with such great fidelity are also huge plusses.  Sonos hit a home run with this one.
