She has tried every product on the market for massage creams and oils. This is the only product she uses after trying them all. She demands the best for herself and her clients, and Biotone Dual-Purpose Massage Creme fits her needs perfectly. She has not find a product that comes close. If your a massage therapist, try this product out - its worth the premium if you too demand the best.PS - I hope this review gives you some insight and help with your choice, and a little knowledge from an unbiased owner.
