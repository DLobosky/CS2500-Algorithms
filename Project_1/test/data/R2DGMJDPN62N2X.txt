In two new books, "Today I will Fly" And "My Friend is Sad" he introduces two  new characters to his cast--Piggie, an upbeat and optomistic pig and her best friend, Gerald a more melancholy, 'realistic' elephant who wears glasses.In this book, Piggie decides that (as the title indicates) she will fly today.  Gerald doesn't think a pig can fly and tells her so, inspite all of her efforts by the end--with help from another friend she teaches Gerald a lesson and he too wants to fly.This is a great book (though I think the other book in the pair is a little stronger) its on a similar level as "Green Eggs and  Ham" and clearly the publisher realised this as it is very similar in shape, size and general physical design to the smaller Dr. Seuss books.  Definately great for a young audience.
