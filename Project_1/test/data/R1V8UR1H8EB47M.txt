Really pretty design but that's about all. It's kind of rough on the skin and doesn't offer much warmth. You still need another comforter for those very cold days. My daughter seems to like it though and I got her the sheet set that goes along with it. It pills up after washing so be careful. Overall pretty good value though not the best.
