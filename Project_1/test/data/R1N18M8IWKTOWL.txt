I don't read a lot of romantic suspense, but Lynette Eason is one of the authors whose books I always like to read.  This story sounded like it was going to be good right from the start, and it was.  It didn't take long, just a few pages really, for the action to get started and it never really stopped.  Sometimes it almost felt like there was too much going on, but in order for a suspense book to hold my attention, I need a lot of tension and a lot of excitement.  When the Smoke Clears certainly did that very well.This book is very fast-paced and I could not seem to read it fast enough to find out what was going to happen.  Now, I knew that this book was the first in a new series, but there was so much that was left hanging and left unanswered at the end that I can hardly wait to read the next book.  Lynette was very clever the way she did that because it seems to be a bit different from the way she has written in the past; at least the books I have read.  So, overall, if you like romantic suspense, When the Smoke Clears is a winner.  I think this is my favorite book by Lynette Eason so far and I am looking forward to the rest of this exciting series.
