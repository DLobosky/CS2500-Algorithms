He too had diarreha (sp?) initially (as mentioned by the previous post). He was only on a wet diet when I got him. His fur was a dirty, dingy dusty black and easily matted. He has been on this since May and his coat is gorgeous!  I didn't know he was that handsome. Shiny, so soft and smooth. So obviously... diet affected his fur. Good stuff in, good stuff out. I would suggest transitioning to dry if your cat was only on wet previously.  Start by giving this as a small handful of treats. Then put next to the wet food, then one meal wet and the other dry, and then all dry.  That is what I did. Now the wet food they get once or twice a week as a treat.I will be trying the sample pack of wet food next once the Iams wet is used up. Not sure if Amazon has the sample pack, but I know the Halo website does. Great idea, by the way.. the sample pack.Really.. this stuff is very good for your littlest family members.
