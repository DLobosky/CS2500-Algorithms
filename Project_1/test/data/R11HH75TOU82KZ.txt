As a Level 1, it's really meant for a parent to read with them anyway, but my 6-year old is probably reading Level 3 or 4 of this type-series, where they are supposed to read independently and would need help with some of those words.  It's nice that they include a list of the fancy words in the back with their definitions.  In this one they are beret, gallery, landscape, lavender, masterpiece, merci, observant, overjoyed, portrait, spectacular and still life.As other reviewers have mentioned, so much of this story takes place before leaving on the trip and on the bus rather than at the museum which is a bit disappointing.  And the throwing up thing is gross -- plus if my kid threw up on a field trip, they'd make me come and pick her up.  I do like how the teacher made her feel better about what happened though and helped her make the most of the rest of her day.Overall though, it's not the best one I've read... I liked Fancy Nancy Sees Stars (I Can Read Book 1) much better.
