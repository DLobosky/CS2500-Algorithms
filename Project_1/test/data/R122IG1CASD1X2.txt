Craver handles this story with a smooth touch and loving caress. "A Gift Forever" tugs on the reader's heart. There's a very strong element of faith and family that shines throughout the novel.The plot flows organically. The first person narration is well done and Craver captures the voice of a seven-year-old effortlessly, putting the reader right in the scenes next to Debby. Craver's authentic descriptions and dialogue allow the reader to picture Finley, Ohio easily.The novel's rich characterization is the best part of the story. Debby is warm-hearted, yet a bit mischievous. She's also honest and sincere. Debby's father's determination to overcome a challenge is inspiring, but what I really enjoyed is that the story involves the entire family. I especially liked Gail's story. She has a second change at love, but will she take it? Does Carl possess the conviction to change the course of his life? Will Kathy overcome the handicap of polio?"A Gift Forever" is an inspirational fiction. It embodies the hope, faith, love, and joy of the season. An emotional and engaging read!
