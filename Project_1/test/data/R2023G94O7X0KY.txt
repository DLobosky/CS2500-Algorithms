This is a nice case for the AT&T Samsung GS2. I really like the matte finish on the back and the glossy edge of the front bezel. It looks very attractive on the phone. The case fits almost perfectly. My only complaint is that the Samsung OEM micro USB plug doesn't seem to make a good connection into the phones jack. I'm not sure if I got a defective case. If not for this, it would have received 5 stars.
