I have only had this for a little over a week. I got this for my CQ60 and it fits perfectly. You may have to move it around a bit but you will hear it snap in place I tried pulling it loose and it would not budge. If you are used to just sitting your computer down near you on the couch or something like I do then you will have to stop, or at least not leave it there too long because the battery does get hot and  things get a bit iffy but it seems to only happen only after I have left the computer on the couch in a position where no air circulates around the battery. I did the battery health check and since it was my first time with a new battery I was almost pissed. It will at first tell you the battery is no good if you just click on the test but  you have to actually start the test for it to test the new battery and mine came back good. No cells appeared to be out of order cause hp will let you know! lol It does set the computer up at a nice angle when placed on a desk, when its on your lap it feels a bit weird. I have been able to get the battery charged up to 100%, I say this because I read a lot of reviews on batteries and the companies selling them and on some I saw ppl saying that their battery would never charge passed a certain %. I have been without a battery for so long I dont recall what a good battery life would be but I think this one is pretty good. Yesterday was my first day back at work and I had left my power cord at home my battery was at 32% at 1pm when I got there and when I decided to just shut it down it was at 17 and that was at about 2:45. I dont think my original battery stayed charged more than 2-3 hours on a full charge so its good to me. It was not heavy as I expected from reading some reviews of 12cell batteries I really did not notice it but I do carry mine in a backpack for work and school so that could be a big part of the reason although when I first installed it I did really notice the extra weight but you will get used to it because I no long notice the weight change. What is noticeable is the way the battery comes down on/between your legs. Also if you are used to being a little careless with your computer you will now have to pay more attention to it when sitting it down. I sit mine on the couch a lot and the first few times(because I also have pillows and stuff on my couch)it would tip over, just sit it down flat and you wont have this problem. This was a good purchase(so far)I hope it doesn't just make it to day 31 and then act up but if it does I will be back to edit this review. BTW the two nice little stoppers that came on the battery did not make it after our first trip in the back pack but thats not really a big deal to me
