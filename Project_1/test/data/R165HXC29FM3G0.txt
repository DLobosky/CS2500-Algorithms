Instead, you will find 8 challenges that can be completed individually, or presented to your quilt guild or group. Each challenge stipulates the pattern to be used (and yes, they can all be found on the internet--and that is a good thing because they are not given in detail here) and gives a fabric requirement--either a particular color (or colors) that must be used, a specific fabric that must be included, or a type of fabric that must be used (such as batik, reproduction, or pastels, etc). An example--one of the challenges is to make nine-patch units in black and white with one other color in the entire quilt. You can include other blocks and techniques in this challenge, but it must include the nine-patch block. The variety of finished quilts includes everything from black and white star-like blocks made by adding points to the nine-patch and set in the Fields and Furrows pattern among a log cabin variation block, to a soft black and white nine-patch backdrop for bright red appliqued flowers. The authors, Sharyn Craig and Pam Mostel, are experienced quilters, designers and teachers. They have each completed at least one quilt for each of the challenges and they have invited quilting friends to participate as well. That means that for each challenge you see at least 6 and sometimes 8 different completed quilts. The quilts are extremely different and it is amazing at the new look these basic blocks take on in the hands of the individual quilters. This is the kind of book that gets my creative juices flowing. I have never been one to take a quilt pattern and make the quilt that looks exactly like the one on the cover. I always mix it up somehow, often trying to do it with what I have in my stash. I also love to buy orphaned blocks at thrift stores, yard sales and on the internet and try to finish a pleasing quilt with what someone else has started. If this all sounds familiar to you then I think you will like this book. If you are looking for a pattern book or a book of basic instructions, there are other books that will meet your needs. This is for someone who is comfortable with quilting and is looking for something to make them think beyond the pattern. If you are in charge of projects for a quilt guild you will find some fun ideas here. Other than the Improved Nine-Patch (which is the only pattern included in detail), with its curved seams, the patterns used are within the reach of most skill levels. Some may wish that detailed instructions were included for the basic pattern on each challenge, but I can see how that would present problems. Since there is no specific size of the block to be used, what size pattern would they provide? Most basic quilt books and the internet can provide the patterns needed and experienced quilters can draft their own. Throughout the book the authors share their thoughts on the different challenges, offering insight and tips. I enjoyed reading through and gathering information and inspiration. My only complaint about the book is that I would have loved to see more challenges included. For me, eight was not enough.
