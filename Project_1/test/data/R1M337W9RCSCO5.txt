Constant charging when the battery is at maximum charge will wear it down and make it so they can't hold a charge.My advise is to place the controllers on the charger only when the controller is getting to the point of dying. Then place it on the charger and let it charge all the way before removing it. As soon as the light shows that it is charged take it off base.I understand that at times you need to use more than one controller or one might be dying before the other is charged but I promise you that if you can follow these steps your battery life will last much longer.P.S. I love my charger =)
