This was a nice Spin on the J.L...I think ultimately The company was trying to appeal to the older generation of fans...as well as show the newer generation of fans how they got down down back in the day...and the story was fitting to the artist and concept...however, ultimately..theres a reason why DC and Marvel are doing better today than they were before..meaning...nice attempt but lets keep in in the present or future...Ultimiately...The product was accurate and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 4.8/5I would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others, due to FAIRNESS in PRICING and INTEGRITY
