Tunnel Vision is an SNL/SCTV-like series of skits, of about the same consistency of a typical episode of either.  Some skits are very funny, some not so, but all in all it was probably the second-best of the "skit-flix" of the time.  Of the genre and time period, only The Groove Tube really stands up better.  Both set the tone for later films such as Amazon Women on the Moon, and the multitude of National Lampoon and ZAZ farces that followed.This film is particularly funny for those of us who are old enough to remember the TV shows, political hearings, and commercials that are being parodied... and the general tone of its TV-industry, societal, and political satire is (unfortunately) just as valid today as then.One supposes it's a matter of taste... but those who think that, say, Kentucky Fried Movie was better, really need to justify their opinions with something other than simple sarcastic spewing.  The writing in Tunnel Vision is at least as inventive and clever, and it's really only the 70's themselves that make it "dated".  Yes, it obviously had a lower budget-- all the more reason to appreciate its accomplishments.  KFM was glitzier, and had more "starpower" (assuming you consider Bill Bixby a star), but in essence, was only a derivative attempt to latch onto The Groove Tube's inertia. Tunnel Vision is much more original.And to complain about language and nudity-- in this day and age?!?  Well, there's just no accounting for hypocrisy, I guess.  Some people just seem to forget that nobody forced them to watch anything.  (P.S.--there's a LOT more nudity in KFM.)If one doesn't care for the 70's in general, then yes, "it doesn't stand up well".  But I would suspect that the real motivation for that opinion might be more rooted in personal disdain of the noticeably anti-authoritarian, don't-believe-the-corporate-bullsh$$t attitude that pervades MOST of the successful movies of that era, including this one. One has to remember that the country was still in recovery from Nixon, Vietnam, and a fairly major recession... an era all-too-reminiscent of the quagmires of today.  No, this isn't a movie for die-hard Republicans....And it is interesting to recognize some of the cast members (mostly comedians) so early in their careers, who would go on to other flicks, sitcoms and later stardom... Such as Chevy Chase, Howard Hessman, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Phil Proctor, Betty Thomas, Tom Davis, Neil Israel, a chubby(!) Larraine Newman, and yes, senator Al Franken (who is also billed as a "creative consultant"... i.e. contributing writer?)If you liked The Groove Tube, and the unedited Putney Swope, you'll like this Flick.
