I love that I can get a replacement battery hear for my Myfi delphi ToGo XM radio. It came pre-charged and I put it right in, and it laster over two hours and I decided to plug it in and let it charge. I love Sirius/Xm and this is great, I don't need a new radio, I can keep using the one I have and like allot.Update, after a full charge the battery lasted 4 hours and still have charge on it. I am very pleased with it.
