He would get a lump on his neck wherever I would apply it, so I stopped using topical insecticide for flea control. I really like Program. It controls fleas for a month, and I never have a problem with my cat getting sick. I put the medication into a little bowl with tuna juice from a can, mix it up, and he drinks it right away. Even if your cat has a flea infestation, just give them a flea bath and use Program. It's so much safer for the cat. I'll never use anything else.
