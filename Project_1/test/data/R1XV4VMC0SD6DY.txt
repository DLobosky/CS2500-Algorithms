If you are the type of person who needs to tweak your EQ until it sounds just right, the S9 will not disappoint.  Only Rockbox is better, in this regard.- FLAC / Ogg Vorbis support.  Open source codec support is always a good thing.  Cowon players generally support FLAC And Vorbis, as do many Sandisk players.- Video.  The AMOLED screen is beautiful, but also coupled with that is the ability to playback XVID AVI's WITHOUT CONVERTING THEM.  What a huge time saver!   It even plays back AC3 encoded AVI's, which I was happily surprised about.   It does not playback MKV's, DIVX AVI's or MPG's, so it's not perfect.- No software required.    Do you have your music already, and just want to get it onto the player?   No problem - just drop it via Explorer / Nautilus / Finder.   What could be easier than that?- Community support and frequent firmware updates.  Granted, Cowon will probably slow down the updates at some point, but it's nice to see that they listen to their users and actually try to fix things.  One recent update added gapless support, for example.  And there are excellent forums in [...] for any questions / issues you might have.- (Optional) video-out cable is not as bad as I expected it to be.  I tested this on a 640x480 XVID pumped out to a 52" LCD, and it's definitely watchable.   Granted, it doesn't look like HD, but it is a composite cable so that makes sense.The not so good:- No AAC support.    Not a big deal for me, but if you get your music from the iTunes Store, then this will be a problem for you.- The UI is pretty mediocre.    You can change this somewhat via community built themes, don't expect it to be a snazzy as an iPod or Zune HD.- Proprietary USB cable.   I really hate that - requires me to buy a second cable, just in case my primary one is lost / broken.Also, keep in mind that this player does NOT have Wifi or an App Store.  Yes, it plays some flash games, but I wouldn't buy the player for that.  Buy it if you are looking for an excellent portable music and video player, as that's what the S9 does well.
