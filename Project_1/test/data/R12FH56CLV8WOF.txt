When writing these types of ads, you have to make every letter count.The same principle applies with Twitter. You only have 140 characters to say what you want to say. If you want someone to share your tweet, then you have even less. Again, you have to make every letter count.In this book, author Joel Comm will teach you how to make every letter count. He takes you step by step through Twitter and shows you how to set up your marketing campaign from the beginning.In fact, it's to the point of being annoying. Comm spends an entire chapter on how to set up your profile (If you already have a Twitter account, you may want to skim this part.) You'll find plenty of photos to show you exactly what your profile should look like and how to get more from your profile by creating a background and personalizing everything.Now don't get me wrong. There are some valauble tips here, like how to get the most your biography on your profile (it can only be 160 characters long.) He also includes some good information on how to write your tweets so you get the most out of them.Something he talks about in this book is choosing "quantity over quality" when building your following. I think this is an important issue, but being the egalitarian I am, I won't stop someone from following me unless they really are spamming me with stuff I'm not interested in, like certain types of medicines for men (you know what I mean).Comm also includes information on using the Twitter API, as well as some top tools that he recommends you use. Most of these tools are free, so they will help you with your marketing.You'll also find a lot of "Twitterers" throughout the book, and you may even want to follow some of these people/corporations. (I would highly recommend you study some of them as it may help you with your own Twitter marketing.)Although I enjoyed reading this book, and I got some valuable tips, like integrating a background into your profile in a way that allows you promote more of your sites, some of the rest of the advice seemed somewhat time consuming. I am a one person business, and both my time and marketing time are limited. I simply don't have time to sit on Twitter waiting for someone to "tweet" me. This information makes for good advice if you want to add it to your current marketing plan, which I will do. Just don't make this the main part of your marketing plan unless you really have that much time.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Twitter beginner. It will help you understand the finer points of marketing with Twitter, and it has a nice 30 day action plan to help you get started. If you are an expert marketer, you will want to go beyond this book for information on integrating Twitter into your overall marketing plan.Jinger Jarrett, AuthorInternet Marketing For Free: The Guide: Internet Marketing To Go!
