I'm so glad I didn't read the reviews for this book before I bought it, because then I wouldn't have bought it and would have missed out on a great read.  It appears that this is part of a series, but I have read none of the other books in it.  So if you've not read the others, you can still enjoy this one.  The start of this book was not good for me.  I felt like a lot of the circumstances and scenes were forced by the author.  I thought I would really dislike this book.  But shortly thereafter, I really got into the story and I could not put it down.  Others have said this is a better mystery than a romance and that could be somewhat true.  I just enjoyed the book and found it an entertaining read, both from a suspense and a romantic perspective.  I definitely recommend it. 4.5
