This is a very well written police mystery in the mold of Patricia Cornwell.  The author demonstrates a very good knowledge of forensic analysis and the value of evidence.  His chapter on autopsy is very well done and his command of medical terminology is evident.  The story begins quickly and holds interest throughout with an unexpected solution and tense ending scene.  I look forward to seeing more of Alex MacLean's work.This novel was received as an eBook from the author in exchange for an honest review.
