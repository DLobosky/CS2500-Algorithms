Note: I made some immature Mormon  angry over my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as I post them.So, your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksA short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie.This is a super romantic movie that even men will like. It's a wonderful romance involving a Korean War veteran who returned home to a changed world. He's married and leaves on a train trip selling chocolates. On the train, he meets a young woman who is going home to her family's vineyard in Napa, California. A warm movie about family and love. Anthony Quinn is great as the grandfather.I always hesitate to say too much about a movie for fear of ruining for the first-time viewer. This is enough, except to say that I've watched it a million times--well at least fifty.
