This film felt like the first draft of a screenplay. There were huge leaps of logic, slow points, weak dialog and even more slow points. Most importantly, it was impossible to connect with either of the main characters, so what could have been an interesting exploration into how they understand and forgive each other becomes a snoozy stare-fest that competes with Drive for 2011's Most Overuse of Staring Award. Did I mention the slow points?The central premise is a question of whether the hero can undo the deaths she caused, all wrapped in a pseudo-science fiction front cover. It loses its footing when they establish that all the inhabitants of the other Earth are identical to the ones here, so there's no reason to believe that the car crash in question didn't happen on Planet B. They could at least have thrown the audience a thread of hope that it might be possible, seeing as we had to watch the two main characters moan constantly for 90 minutes.There's also a very two-dimensional aspect to the entire setup which may be due to the lack of supporting characters in the film. It's hard to imagine the man as a father because we never get to know what he's like in that role. It's hard to see Brit as an inspired, intelligent student whose life is ruined by drinking and driving (don't do it, kids) because it's all rushed through with exposition. So in the end, it seems more like a play with two people with no real depth or engagement.I'm all for watching thoughtful, introverted movies but this one missed the mark by the mile. If you want existential-done-well, try watching Danny Boyle's Sunshine for an example of how this should have turned out.
