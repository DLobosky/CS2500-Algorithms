But the problem could be applied to IP4500 since IP4200, IP4300 and IP4500 all use the same ink cartridge.***********************************************************History: I am very happy with my previous Canon S750 inkjet printer. Specifically, Canon inkjet has been one of the most easy-to-refill printer. The inkhead is wearing out under 3 years heavy use. So, I bought the IP4300 to replace the S750. Starting from IP4200, Canon added chip to each ink tank to prevent the printer from using any user-refilled ink tank. There are work-around for people to still use refilled ink tank with IP4200/IP4300 (not sure about IP4500). Problem: For my brand new IP4300, after 1 month of use, the printer started to complain that cyan ink tank (not refilled, the original one that came with the printer) was not recognized. So, I had to open the lid, take out the cyan ink tank and put it back to the tank slot again. The printer would then recognize the cyan ink tank. After 1 more week use, the printer just could not recognize the cyan ink tank anymore. Took the cyan ink tank out and put it back would not work. Investigation: I searched the Canon web site, but could not find any useful infor to solve this problem. I then searched the web and realized quite some people had the same problem with IP4200 or M500. Based on other people's feedbacks, it seems the chip on the cyan ink tank is defact. So, I call the Canon support. The tech support "seems to familiar with" this kind of problem. He quickly proposes that the cyan ink tank may be bad. So he send me a new cyan ink tank with fedex 2-day shipping. I put the new cyan ink tank in and the printer works fine now.Asssessment:   Pro: I am happy with IP4300's performance, it prints fast, it does duplex printing automatically, it gives out great photo print, it has two seperate paper trays to ease the loading of plain paper and photo paper, it has 5 different ink tanks that can be easily re-filled and there are quite some vendors to supply IP4200/IP4300/IP4500 inks for refilling.   Con: It's too bad that the printer just stops if not all 5 ink tanks are installed.        I still don't know how often the chip in the ink tank will go bad (reliability issue?).*****************************The is an incremental update after owning IP4300 for 3 months (IP4300 and IP4500 are similar). Canon adds chip to each ink cartridge to scare people away from refilling the cartridge. However, it's fairly easy to work-around that chip. I have successfully refilled the ink cartridges and I am able to disable the printer from complaining about the refilled cartridges . The biggest surprise: The 3rd party ink produces beautiful photo prints also (really can not tell it's not from Cannon's own ink). Well, this credit should go to the ink provider, not to Cannon though.  Given that I am able to control my ink cost by refilling ink for my  IP4300, I definitely recommend this powerful IP4300/IP4500 printers to friends.
