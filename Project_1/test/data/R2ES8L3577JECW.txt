I have some very good ear buds, but they do not have a microphone, so I can't use them for phone calls.  The Skullcandy Mic Ear Buds are designed for cell phones.  They came with two sets of silicone ear buds, and the mediums size buds are exceptionally comfortable...something that obviously is hit-or-miss as everyone has ears that are vary in size and shape.They were designed for phone conversations, so they boost the voice to be louder than the bass and treble.  That boost to the mid-range makes voices easier to understand, but it gives male voices a bit of a hard, metallic quality.  And, that boosted mid-range does not work well with some sorts of music.  Mick Jagger's voice was deliberately buried in the mix of many Stones songs, but with the INK'D Mic, his voice is way out in front of the band.My own voice comes through the mic the same way, loud and clear, but with a bit of a robotic/metallic quality...people can understand what I'm saying, but they also know I'm talking through a mic.If being able to understand your callers and have your callers understand you is your TOP priority, these are a good choice.  If you want your voice to have a warm, natural quality, these are not for you.They have a control switch that is supposed to turn the mic on and off and pause music tracks.  That feature does not seem to work on my phone...the mic is ON when I accept a call, just as it should be.
