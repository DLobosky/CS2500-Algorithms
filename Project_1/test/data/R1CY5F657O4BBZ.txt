Amazon was the cheapest I could find for just the raw batteries, not packaged with a charger or anything.  They arrived fully charged and ready to use.  This is my second batch of Eneloops that I have purchased and am once again 100% satisfied.  They do everything regular non-rechargables can do, but no ongoing cost of purchase and obviously no wasted heavy metals going into the ground.  After much researching, Eneloops had the best specs and satisfaction of any ultra-low self discharge batteries... thats why I went with them, and so should you.
