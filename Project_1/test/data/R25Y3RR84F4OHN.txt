I will say Thank You for all those people who left comments on my review of the documentary called: The Atheism Tapes which was Wrongfully Deleted. I Will NOT be posting anymore Reviews on Amazon.com! I WILL Only be responding to comments and that is all I will be doing here on Amazon.com! Thanks again.)Justice League: The New Frontier is unique. I really like it for it has a classic look to it. The classic look is a 1940s to 1960s art form to it. I loved it when Martian Manhunter transformed into the classic and famous cartoon character named: Bugs Bunny. I love Bugs Bunny it brought back childhood memories seeing Bugs Bunny drinking soda. Justice League: The New Frontier has action, the guest appearance of Aquaman, Supergirl and others. My boy Superman was not there for the main action but Superman is there and I Love Superman. The Centre is the enemy as a resolute it is worth seeing.
