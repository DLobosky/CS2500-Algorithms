Now a young woman serious about pursuing medicine, 18-year-old Hannah Bonner embarks on an intership with a medical clinic in early 19th century New York City. Her intent is to learn about the new smallpox vaccine, so she can bring the knowledge home to her village, and more importantly, her fellow Indians.Yet of course, in attempting such a thing, Hannah faces enormous prejudice, as much of New York is open in their dislike of women practicing medicine -- let alone half-Indian women. Back at home, Hannah's family is trying to help a young pregnant slave woman on her journey to freedom. Adding to the obvious difficulties is Liam Kirby, a bounty hunter on her heels -- despite his having been part of the Bonner's family as a child. All the while, Hannah also struggles with her sense of self, her feelings of being caught between the white and the Indian cultures. She knows the decisions she makes now will affect her life's path forevermore -- especially when a young Mohawk she's immediately drawn to comes to visit."Lake in the Clouds" is an enjoyable read about a memorable family, continuing its joys and struggles in a true-to-life way.
