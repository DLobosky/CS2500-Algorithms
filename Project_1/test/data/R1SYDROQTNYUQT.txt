"Do not buy this DVD". I am very sure and I heard and read from some web site.. Going to release just like LORD OF THE RINGS in "BLU-RAY" extended cut" around DEC. even all the LORD OF THE RINGS series going to release on "BLU-RAY" too. Around fall! I stopped buy any DVDS, till "BLU-RAY" hit the stores this summer. All old and new titles gonna release on BLU-RAY, with that will get crystal clean pic and sound.. Yes I loved the movie, and love the way he makes movies.but just rent it for now.if u never seen it. But if u DVD collector like I am..Better an wait then sorry!
