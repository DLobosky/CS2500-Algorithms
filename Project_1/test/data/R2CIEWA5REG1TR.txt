There is also lots of nice supplementary information about how to use German in various situations.  The visual format is attractive.Unfortunately it is not sufficient by itself for learning German vocabulary, because it does not include important information such as the plural forms of nouns.  It's really most useful for TRANSLATING.Also, the paper is a bit delicate, which makes flipping through it to look up words a slow process.  This is perhaps inevitable because the dictionary is so big --- unless, here's an idea:  how cool would it be if they would print the dictionary in two volumes, one of which is German-English and the other of which is English-German!  After all most of the time you only want to use one or the other.My favorite German dictionary is Langenscheidts Gro&szlig;w&ouml;rterbuch Deutsch als Fremdsprache.  This is entirely in German, so you need some basic knowledge of German before you can use it, but it is meant for learners, and gives really detailed definitions along with practical information about how to use words.  By comparison, Collins appears to define maybe twenty or thirty percent more German words, but gives less useful information about them.  Of course Collins also has English to German, and for translating some words, such as names of plants or animals, a German-German dictionary is not much help.  I recommend using Langenschedits GDaF as soon as you are advanced enough to use it, and use something like Collins Unabridged as a backup if you can't find the desired information there.  If you are a beginner, you might want a smaller translation dictionary (Collins comes in several sizes).Note: I'm reviewing the 5th edition.  My understanding is that the 7th edition is very similar.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.
