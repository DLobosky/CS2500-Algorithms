This is a really fun game to use with the Wii Zapper. It's not a hugely long game but it's a game that can get a lot of use. In this game you have to pass different levels to unlock more games. I found each game to be unique and fun. I have some that I like better than others, but all around each level and each mini game was a lot of fun for me. The Wii Zapper works exceedingly good with this game. We've played this game for hours and just keep trying to do better and better. Some of the games I found to be hard and had to play quite a few times before I passed to another level. I still only have the bronze medal in most of the games so there is always room for improvement for repeat plays. I got another game with my zapper to play and this game that came with it was the better of the two. We've really enjoyed it so far and I would recommend it for target practice for the Zapper.
