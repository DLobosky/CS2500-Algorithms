But NOOO.Grier Hadley, a bastard, has struck a deal with her biological father, the very rich, but criminal Jack Hadley. Jack has endowed Grier with an outrageous dowry; in return, she is to marry a "blueblood," providing Jack with his long-desired connections to the ton. This deal, however, is not unpalatable to Grier either. She too longs for stability, respectability, and a home of her own.Now, enter Prince Sevastian Maksimi. Our crown prince of Maldania has traveled to England to find a suitable bride, a future queen. However, his county, Maldania, after a decade or so at war is in dire financial straights. So, Sevastian's future queen must not only be a gently bred, of impeccable bloodlines female, she must also be in possession of a fortune.  So, the novel opens at a ball, where Grier is hiding behind some potted plants, listening to a couple of biddies gossiping about her - she is a bastard after all, rather tall, and tanned BIG No! No-s! for the ton, large dowry or not. Said biddies are then replaced by Sevastian and his cousin, who - and this part is rather farcical, especially since it is told through Grier's perspective - in a rather dry, factual manner discuss how unfit Grier is for Sevastian's purposes. It is at this point that Grier has had enough and empties her glass of lemon water on Sevastian's head - thus begins the antagonism between the two protagonists, which leads to attraction and then love. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good escapism novel. Not only is the opening engaging, but the rest of the novel as well, as are the primary and secondary characters. Grier is a lovely woman of "eight and twenty," who has a very light and comical perspective on life and her current situation. She is smart and un-cowed by Sevastian's "price-liness." Grier is also insecure, especially about fitting into the ton, and her introspections on that subject are true, unexaggerated, but amusing as well.Sevastian, on the other hand, is a much more serious character. He has many responsibilities - what with being a crown prince and all. Basically, his life belongs to his country, not himself: he does everything for the future of his kingdom. However, Grier brings out the more adventurous side of him. She squashes the staid prince with her "fiery spirit," making him long for something of his own. Plus, the two characters compliment each other beautifully.The sexual attraction between the two protagonists was well developed; however, the actual sex scenes could have been hotter. The dialogue was witty, and Jordan spared her readers any unnecessary, distracting detail. However, what brings this novel down in my estimation (from 5 stars to 4) is the ending.About ninety percent of this book is driven by the attraction and the formation of the relationship between Grier and Sev. Yet, all of a sudden, in the last 40 pages or so, Jordan introduces a rather contrived and needless kidnapping plot. Why oh why must she ruin the flow of the book? Why must there be some sort of life-threatening incident - and this happens in more historical romance novels than I can count- toward the end of the book that forces the two characters into realizations of and confessions of love. I mean come on. Grier and Sev were doing so well up to this point; they both new they were in love; they just hadn't gotten around to the emotional declarations. Not only is the kidnapping unnecessary, but it doesn't fit with both the drive of the novel and the maturity of the characters - they would have gotten around to the "I love you-s" without this incident. The last forty pages aside, this is, as I said, a very good Cinderella escapism. If you can forgive, or better yet overlook, the ending, you won't regret purchasing and reading this novel. I recommend it.original on romancecritic
