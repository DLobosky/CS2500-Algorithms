One of the first questions asked in this book is, &quot;What are your blessings?&quot;  And I was so surprized to realize that that question stumbled me.  I had not, until reading this book, claimed my blessings.  And that is why I had not reached the prosperity that God has been holding for me.Although I just read this book, I am already experiencing monumental enhancements in my life.And I must also say that for the first time, I am convinced that tithing is important, for all of us.  It took me a few seconds to digest the importance of this, while reading &quot;Open Your Mind to Prosperity.&quot;  I had spent my life saying, &quot;no way am I going to give away money to any church.  They take away enough, during the service!.&quot;Happily, my attitude has evolved on this subject, and on the subject of money consciousness.Read this book to be at peace with your life's journey.  And know that everything that has happened to you is what was meant to be.In reading this book, you have the opportunity to restore what you believe that you have loss --- into immeasurable gains.Do everything in this book. And even if something seems odd, or something that you believe won't work, try it anyway.  I have, and I have reaped the benefits, of this small investment.Thank you, Catherine Ponder!
