It's enough to make me get a DVD - the first movie in this triology is being reintroduced in DVD, and the VHS is not for sale.  Fortunately, I went and ordered all three in VHS format 'somewhere' - but this is our  favorite family movie, so we are going to need the DVD version!These  movies are GREAT for the whole family to watch - we did these as a marathon  one week-end, and was it fun.  The first one is still the favorite, but  that's because it lays the groundwork for this one and the next. Just  when we think everything is safe, Doc shows up again at Marty's house and  tells him he has to go back to the future (in the first movie, they went  back to the past and then back to the present, which is...well, nevermind,  just watch it and you'll understand).They really do go to the future,  where things are getting really messed up.  Marty's father is dead, his  mother's married to Biff, his own son is a throw-back to Marty's father's  wimpy days, and his daughter -- suffice it to say, Michael J. Fox would not  make a pretty drag queen.How things got so messed up (really, because of  something Marty did in the past), and how Marty attempts to unravel is,  brings us not only to the future, but back to the original movie, where  Marty has to avoid running into himself.When you can get the first one,  grab the trilogy, pop up some corn, sit back and enjoy. This whole  series has made it to our family library, movies that we want to own  (because watching once just isn't enough!). Movies we pay to keep have to  be  entertaining or educational to grown-ups and kids, both.Just a  little heads up for parents of young kids -I was surprised in watching this  for the umpteenth time, but with a mom's eye and ear, to hear several  really unnecessary cusswords scattered throughout all three movies. Oh,  nothing to bad, but they could have been left out entirely.  My 8-year  old's eyes popped open - he knows that swear words are kind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry. For those who don't have  kids and think I'm being too prissy, just wait til ya have kids of your  own!
