Indy is at it again this he's old.  I have a hard time even giving this movie a 3-star rating to be honest with you, but there was enough of the good stuff to make this movie enjoyable.  Many old characters are brought back for some good memories.  This movie is filled with excitement, adventure and a lot of humor and it is sure to keep your attention. Once again, the reason I love all of these movies is because Indy seems like such a normal guy & not some super hero.  Many didn't like the play on Aliens, but that didn't bug me at all.  My problem with this movie started as soon as Indy's son starts swinging on vines like he's Tarzan or something and some how catches up to cars moving 50-60 MPH.  It was cheesy and the special effects were garbage.  I didn't like the ensuing ant scene either.  This movie got sloppy in places which is something you NEVER would have seen in the original films.  One of the things I love most about these films is that they are good for the whole family.
