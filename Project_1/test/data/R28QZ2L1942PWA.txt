First of all this is a wonderful story and the second in the Holmes canon. This not a short story but a novel, actually the second novel (total of 4 novels) with the other 50+ stories being short stories. This ideally should be read second, after A Study in Scarlet (Sherlock Holmes Vol. 1) (where Watson and Holmes meet). Sign of Four is where Watson meets his wife but that is not the focus of the strory. After reading The Sign of Four, and assuming you are still into reading SH, and you will be, your next book should ideally be the short stories in the The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. This is the order in which they were written and the character introduced to readers in the late 19th century.This work is a real page turner with 12 chapters - the 12th and final chapter takes up almost 25% of the novel and is the back story which shows the motivation and context for the crime - much like part 2 in Study in Scarlet. The story begins by introducing us to Holmes between cases, where he may sit around all day, everyday, injecting himself with his 7% solution of cocaine to pass the time. Yes, cocaine was legal back then and even Freud prescribed it to patients and used it himself - no wonder he was obsessed with sex. Of course once a case comes his way he no longer needs cocaine or morphine to pass the time and becomes energized unravelling subtle clues missed by Scotland Yard's best. Here is an excerpt..."My mind," he said, "rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world." "The only unofficial detective?" I said, raising my eyebrows. "The only unofficial consulting detective," he answered. "I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection..."Regarding this Kindle edition three points. 1) It is well formatted 2) there are NO illustrations in this free version and 3) 'on my Kindle' you cannot 'Go To' the Table of contents directly but there is a TOC. However, once at the TOC page there are no usable links to each chapter but strangely there are links to each chapter on the Kindle app for both my Mac and my iPhone but I read this story on my new Kindle. No big deal just useful to know but you can't beat the price. Wonderful read!!!
