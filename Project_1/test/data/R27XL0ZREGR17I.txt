I would be remiss indeed if I did not start this review by stating that as a timepiece, this is a superb instrument. For $500+, it better be! A watch like this is sure to fuel the debate- "What is a good timepiece?" Is it about prestige? If so, I doubt that you'll turn heads once they get a look at the blazing red letters on the bezel that state "SOLAR TOUGH!" Elegant it is not. Is about quality? Here things get a bit dicey. This watch, on the inside at least, reeks of quality. But I doubt that anyone but you will know that. In truth,  Casio quality is definitely a trickle-down affair. That is to say that the same quality of fit, finish and assembly is displayed in Casio's costing $50. Ouch!Is it about style? I guess that this is the hundred dollar question today. Painfully obvious is the fact that this Rolls Royce of Casios looks pretty much the same as their other chronographs costing a fraction of the price. You'll still get the red and white "info" that is overdone all over the face. I for one can't get past the 10pt upper face font at 12:00 that screams "SOLAR TOUGH". This is a large black plastic affair. The buttons are plastic. The case and band are plastic. The bezel appears to be stainless, but is stamped from thin metal making it look cheap(er) than it should.I could go on and on about the solar technology which is a debatible feature. Cool, yes. Efficient, not really. The technology charges an internal battery and does not replace it. It's a good guess that all that technology is anything but biodegradable. The LCD display which provides redundant information looks cheap and very lo tech in a world of high resolution color displays. Do you really need all the confusing little features and indexes that make simple "looking at the time" an acquired skill?So lets get right down to it. This Casio is designed to be a neat gift for the affluent man who has everything. You'd better leave the price tag on the box to back up this fact if you are gifting. The entire affair is too plasticy to justify the price and too gimicky to be taken for an elegant timepiece. On the other hand, if you really are an explorer/ map maker or time traveler, then this is the only watch you'll ever need--in the field at least. It would look bizarre at a black tie affair.As a personal time information display, this CASIO is top of the line. Period. As an everyday man's watch, it leaves much to be desired- especially in the price department.
