The hubby and I watched The Big Year last night.  With a cast that includes Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson, who can resist?  It was a decent movie and definitely worth seeing at least once.  The acting was great and the plot was well thought out.  It wasn't quite as funny as I was hoping for but there were some moments that I couldn't help but chuckle.Disclosure: I received this movie for free for review purposes.  All opinions are 100% my own.
