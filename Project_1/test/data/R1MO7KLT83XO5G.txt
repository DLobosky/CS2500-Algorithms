Most digital cameras include an 8Mb CF card which is definitely not adequate, you can only get about 8-11 pictures at 1600x1200 with medium compression.  On a 128 Mb card, you can fit over 200 pictures!  Now you can go on vacation without a laptop and not run out of digital film.  If your camera does slideshows and hooks up to a TV, you're all set for family show and tell.This card, including the rebate, is the best value for a 128 Mb card.  I did not notice any differences between this card and my Kodak CF card in terms of speed of transfers, previewing pictures on the camera, or reading from a card reader.  If anything, it seems faster than the Kodak CF card, but this is just an impression as I did not time it with a stopwatch.As noted, the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within 15 days of the purchase date.
