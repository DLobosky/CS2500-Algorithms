I'm reviewing this collection because there is so little info on what's in the value pack! I called Big Idea, and they couldn't help me because this is a discontinued item. So, get this deal while you can! There will not be anymore once Amazon runs out according to Big Idea customer service. According to the internets:Value Pak 1 containsVeggie Tales: Madame Blueberry - A Lesson in ThankfulnessVeggie Tales: King George and the Ducky - A Lesson About SelfishnessVeggie Tales: Esther - The Girl Who Became QueenThis isn't a bad collection, but you can currently buy the same movies cheaper by buying the "Veggie Tales: Madame Blueberry/Esther the Girl Who Would Be Queen" 2 pack Veggie Tales: Madame Blueberry/Esther the Girl Who Would Be Queen and the "King George and the Ducky" VeggieTales - King George and the Ducky seperately.So save a little more and buy them seperately!Just in case you wondering:Value Pak 2 contains:Veggie Tales: Josh and the Big Wall - A Lesson in ObedienceVeggie Tales: Rack, Shack & Benny - A Lesson in Handling Peer PressureVeggie Tales: Lyle the Kindly Viking - A Lesson in SharingSome people seem to think a value pack 3 is coming, but seeing that 1 and 2 are discontinued, I doubt we'll be seeing 3.
