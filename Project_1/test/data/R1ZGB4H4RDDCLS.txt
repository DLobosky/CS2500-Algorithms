When I got to my destination and carefully reviewed the directions, I discovered that this device is explicitly not for electronics like phones, computers and televisions.   So I was left with a functionally useless converter.My only concern is that this information is not explicitly stated on the packaging, which strikes me as negligently dishonest.  Although I did use my computer through this successfully (although the black box buzzed louder than normal) it did not suffer any ill effects.  My guess is that Conair doesn't want to be responsible for any electrical failures that they warrantee.   In other words, if this fries out your hair dryer, they'll help you out, but if it fries your lap top, you're on your own.  Over all, you would be far better buying a converter that is explicitly for electronics and save this one for something more mundane.
