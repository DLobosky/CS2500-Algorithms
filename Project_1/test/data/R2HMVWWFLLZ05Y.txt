I now get mad when Authors do not create books for Kindle, and the Wispersync with the iPhone is the best ever.If you love to read, you should get one.I carry now all the books, the dictionary, and more all the time, in my pocket.A soon as the Kindle 2 was out I got one, and give this to my Mother, who loves it...
