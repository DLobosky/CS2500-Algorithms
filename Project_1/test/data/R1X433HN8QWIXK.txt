The cabinet has a face frame but the drawers are floating and there is no cross member in the face frame that separates the drawers as there would be on a kitchen cabinet. Hard to explain... but picture the face frame with a large opening for the cabinet door and a smaller, thin, and rectangular opening for the upper drawer. This tool would be clamped to the piece of 3/4" wood (the horizontal rail) that defines the separation between openings.I didn't understand this difference until I tried to mount my full extension drawer slides and I was having trouble clamping it down on the vertical stile of my face frame. I couldn't find a spot to get any leverage on it, and my Kreg face "klamp" was too big to fit on it. I tried several different angles and even tried using various C-clamps to hold it in place, but it wasn't working. After messing with it for a few minutes I realized I would have been able to cut a few stop blocks or story sticks by now, so I just did that. Drawers are now mounted. Afterward I went back to have another look at the tool instructions and only then did I notice that all illustrations showed the tool clamped to a horizontal rail. That's a subtle difference that belies the advertisement that this is the perfect tool for mounting drawer slides.Perhaps if I was building a more conventional kitchen cabinet (or a few of them) this would be worth it, but I was pretty annoyed. I bought this and the other drawer mounting tool from Kreg. Since Kreg's pocket hole jig got me into furniture building, I expected more from this tool. A tool like this could certainly be a bit more universal and would only require minor modifications to allow it to be used on stile or rail - why don't they do that?
