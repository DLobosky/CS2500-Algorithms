I just learned how to make my own chocolates and these chocolate molds have blown me away. I am lactose intolerant and I also want my chocolates to be sweetened exclusively with xyitol. My recipe: unsweetened cocoa powder, cocoa butter, coconut oil, xylitol (powdered), vanilla. The mix goes in the molds and the little chocolates look like they have been made by a professional. So cute! Though I did not oil the molds the chocolates do not stick and come out very easily. The creases and the detail on the butterflies is amazing. I am ordering more of these molds. So far I have the "leaves" and the "butterflies". Let's see which other ones I am going to get now... :)
