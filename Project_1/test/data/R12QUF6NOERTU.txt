Great general advice about the importance of slack-time and managing the production of schedules. It also has some really startling, yet obvious after-the-fact, advice about the lack of quality that happens when people feel rushed. Even if they're only working their day job hours, if there isn't slack time in their days, it'll affect their output.The missing piece was really, in my opinion, how to measure 'how much' slack time to have. It seemed hard to get a metric for whether it's being used effectively or not.This book follows in the rich tradition of &quot;Lean&quot; processes -- there's a whole wealth of literature out there on how to measure and assess the amount of &quot;slack&quot; in use and its effectiveness. It would've been good to make references to some of that information, though I'll be the first to admit that the dryness might have impacted the light tone of the book. Still, without better concrete tips on how to take action, the book does a good job motivating slack, but fails to really provide the concrete tips needed to execute on it.
