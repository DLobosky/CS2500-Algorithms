Of course, this set only has the first 13. The September 14th release will be a 7-disc box set retailing for [...] MSRP for the DVD and [...] for the Blu-ray, That's about [...] more than most 22-episode releases of FOX shows which typically have a list price of [...] for the DVD. Apparently FOX is claiming the extra [...] is due to music licensing fees, which I guess is understandable with a music based show like Glee. Unlike this release, which has little to no bonus features, the complete season set will have extended episodes, sing-along karaoke, a behind-the-scenes look at 'The Power of Madonna' episode, 'Glee' makeovers, never-before-seen 'Sue's Corner' segments, a dance tutorial and more. I haven't heard anything about episode commentaries, but hopefully there will be some of those as well. As of right now, there are NO PLANS by FOX to release a 2nd volume with the 9 spring episodes as a companion to this volume 1 release. You will have to buy the Sept 14th complete 1st season set if you have already bought release and would like to own the other 9 episodes. In addition, there was talk earlier in the year about an alleged rebate included in the complete 1st season release so that fans who had already bought the volume 1 release could get some money back because they double dipped. Later on, FOX denied any such rebate, but now it looks likes there MOST LIKELY will be a [...] rebate. All the info about this rebate, or "Gleebate" as FOX has dubbed it, will supposably be available after June 1st via a special website FOX has set up.  Several websites already have pictures of the box set up and if you google the words 'gleebate dvd' you should be able to see what the 1st season cover art will look like. So, if you are looking to buy yourself some Glee, hold out until September 14th if you can. If you don't mind spending the money to buy both releases, not to mention having duplicates of the first 13 episodes, then go ahead and buy this Road to Sectionals DVD as Glee truly is a great series!
