First, disclosure:  I'm truly a nobody as Java programmers go. I'm one of those accidental programmers who started learning Perl one day a few years ago, in order to do some CGI programming. But I have been studying Java in a course and have bought a couple books including this one. I've studied and used Perl, PHP, JavaScript, a little Python, and own plenty of computer books, especially O'Reilly titles. Normally I don't dare bash books whose authors are a 9.9 on a knowledge scale of 1 to 10, when I'm about a 1.7. But in this case I make an exception because the way this book is written is mind-numbing, turgid, impenetrable, and boring. They've taken  an inherently fascinating subject and made it dull -- kind of like taking perfectly good pizza and dumping salt all over it.  Books about computer programming languages should have at least  few good laughs in them, and be interesting enough to keep you up at night rather than make you nod off. Perhaps if you're a genius and/or already very well versed in Java, you'll enjoy it and find it useful. Otherwise, go for Just Java 2.
