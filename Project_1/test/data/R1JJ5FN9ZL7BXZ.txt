Since we live in Pasadena, CA - near Mt. Wilson, where ALL the TV broadcasting antennas are located - I figured that we would get many HD TV stations over the air.  We do, but some of the ones we watch most have been a bit "spotty" with pixelation or signal drops at the worst possible moment - so I have been looking for new antennas and have tried quite a few.  We get 122 channels on an amplified bat wing type antenna but I wanted to try something that is not so conspicuous as bat wings or fully extended rabbit ears for a small set in the kitchen.  We got the unamplified, very simple Mohu Leaf antenna last week and hooked it up with a coaxial cable and then tried a few places in the kitchen to see what it would do.  We get 135 digital channels! Really!  The few we watch all the time are at 100% or 98% strength (they were at 68% to 70% before and got dropped some of the time).  Now there is NO pixilation and NO dropping of signals. It looks so simple that it is very hard to believe it will work better than the other antennas, but this elegant thing just blends right in and no one notices it yet it is the best antenna I have ever used. It is made in North Carolina and it about the size of a sheet of paper.  White on one side and black on the other so you can choose which side to face out based on the color.  It has to be placed with the cable at the bottom but it can be stuck to the wall with the velcro paste-on buttons or (they write) stuck to the wall using push pins through the very outside margins. It seems to work best if it is very high up. This is a wonderful product that works well for me.  I ordered another just now. Our friends who have cable TV or dish TV don't really believe that we get this many over-the-air stations and get it in full, uncompressed signal strength. It is true that we can't get the specialized programs of cable or dish systems but if you live in a major market (like L.A.) it is astonishing to see the variety that is available for free - IF you have a really neat Mohu Leaf to help out.  Thank you Mohu (and Amazon) for this treasure of an appliance! I doubt we would have tried it without the Amazon user reviews so I am writing one of the very few reviews I have ever written to pay my debt of gratitude to others.
