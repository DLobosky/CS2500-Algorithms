The Cult is a great band, and this is their best CD.  This CD, "The Cult" doesn't throw itself at you suggesting greatness on a first listen, but stick with it, and let it work its magic.  What stands out is the intensity, commitment, and sheer power of the music, performances, and lyrics.  You can't help but conclude that this CD cuts very close to home for Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy.  "The Cult" is one of those moments in any band's career where everything they've ever worked with comes together at the right time and place, producing a transcendent work that far exceeds the sum of all the parts.
