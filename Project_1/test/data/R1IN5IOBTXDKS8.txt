I can't believe I watched the whole thing!   There are movies that are so bad that they are actually good....well this ain't one of them!  These celebs reached an all time low signing on for this garbage.  Clint Howard,  poor, poor Clint, Ron if you are reading this....get him a real acting  gig!   The acting, story, script, and sountrack are so horrible that it  comparison made &quot;Showgirls&quot; look  pretty darn good!   How sad to  see such people as Olivia Hussey and Jan Micheal Vincent reduced to such  garbage!   The special effects I must admit were fairly good, but totally    twisted.  This movie is so pathetic that the movie &quot;slip cover&quot;  refers to actor David Naughton as Haughton.....now that's bad!
