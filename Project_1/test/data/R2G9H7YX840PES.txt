Over a year after having read it for the first time, I decided to take a second hard look at the book. Some of the concepts that Robert T. Kiyosaki presents in his book have resounded in my head once again. His teachings have helped, I should say: not letting emotions such as fear rule over financial decisions (though it's easier said than done), postponing immediate gratification, and responding with a proactive mind (and a proactive language) in the face of financial adversity.Today, the friend of mine who first recommended Kiyosaki's book to me in on his way out of the rat race, and I find myself in a different place than I was a year ago: I've learned some lessons and I am dying to put others into practice (which I firmly intend to do in the next twelve months).The lessons that impacted me the most:The Rich Don't Work For Money, they have money work for them by creating enough wealth within their assets (and he doesn't count the home they're living in as one, so you can count that one out) to pay for their monthly living expenses, so that they don't need to depend on a job for that, which is the case of most of us. The kind of assets he talks about are businesses that do not require your physical presence: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-generating real estate, etc.The book also goes to some extent into some of the advantages of incorporating your own corporation, but it is by no means an exhaustive guide on the topic; it goes into why you should work to learn, not for money. To have each job as a learning ground on which you can build skills which you can later use for yourself as you run your own corporation or company. Does this sound a little selfish? It might be, and that's another paradigm which the book attempts to break: to mind your own business, meaning to do what you have to, but not to loose sight of your financial goal. The author's point is to make the best of each work experience and learn as much as possible from each. Learn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it needs more editing. At times the author suddenly jumps between thoughts from one paragraph to the next. Ironically enough he admits in the book that he's not one hell of a writer (and he's right about that), but the editor could have done a better job. The other thing is the level of the book. When you're done with it, hopefully (as it did for me) it leaves you thinking, which is a good thing, but it also leaves you with a bunch of questions. Most likely, after having read several of his other books, this was a business-driven decision: not give out the entire 'enchilada' to you in one book, so some of the answers can be found in other books of his, or written by other authors of the 'Rich Dad' series. Other than these two things, the book is interesting, quick to read (doesn't take anything else beyond an open mind) and (if you let it) lifechanging.
