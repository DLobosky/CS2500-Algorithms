The unit uses a nice, clean, smoothed font throughout which contributes to a more "refined" feeling than previous nuvis.- The display speed has been greatly updated.  The map screen updates and menu display speed has been greatly updated, you never feel the nuvi lagging behind your touches.  The map update speed is about as fast as my nuvi 755, which is faster than the 265, which is faster than the 1 Hz update speed of the 350.- The unit is thinner and the bezel seems smaller.  This contributes to a reduced volume and much smaller perception of size in the hand compared to say the 755.- You can change the map display so that the data fields are stacked along the right side as opposed to being in the corners.  I like this view a lot and this is almost enough reason to upgrade my 755.  With this stacked view, you can see 4 data fields (3 are customizable) versus the two in the normal corner view.Cons:- The mounting cradle is a two-step/two-handed affair, unplug the mini-USB then unmount from the two point cradle.  The older, better quality cradle is literally one click grab and go from a nice powered cradle.  Don't know why they removed that (cost savings?).- A common complaint: less detail shown on maps.  The newer nuvi's show fewer street names at the same zoom level as the older units.  The argument being this reduces clutter.  I'm not happy with it, but it's not a deal breaker.  Garmin has added alot of other information to the map display and I can understand they don't want to overwhelm the user with text.Overall, I really like this unit but not enough to replace my 755.  Perhaps if I were upgrading the 350 it would be enough.
