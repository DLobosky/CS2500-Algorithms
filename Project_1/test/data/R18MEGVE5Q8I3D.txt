This is unacceptable and I would like to know what has become of our country that we allow children to see hardcore porn on the Internet, but edit the freakin' Muppet Movie!Vote with your wallets people - Stand up and fight.THE CURRENT EDIT LIST: (That I know of...)1 - The History of Beavis & Butthead (Recalled Paramount release edits 'Good Credit', 'Bedpans and Broomsticks', the beginning of 'Give Blood' and 'Door to Door' and other things) 2 - Ren & Stimpy UNCUT (Of course, it is cut) 3 - Married With Children Season 4 (7 edited episodes) 4 - Tom & Jerry Collection 1 (Gee, why not lie to the kids, who needs history anyway?)5 - Tom & Jerry Collection 2 (Mammy dubbed in 4 episodes) 6 - The Blues Brothers (Theatrical Version edits a Belushi line) 7 - Star Wars Eps IV, V, and VI (I would buy these all over again if I could get them completely uncut and original) 8 - Blade Runner (Theatrical Version unavailable - cut version sucks!) 9 - Time Life's 'Beavis & Butthead: There Goes The Neighborhood' DVD10 - Beavis & Butt-head: The Mike Judge Collection (The worst of all with almost 100 cuts!)11 - Roseanne Season 1 (Edited, syndicated eps were used)12 - In Living Color (Musical performances edited out)and now, sadly....13 - The Muppet Movie (The 'Grasshopper' line)In case you think I'm being harsh giving such a great movie 1 star, I think you need to think about what is at stake when we are destroying original art and editing our history for future generations.
