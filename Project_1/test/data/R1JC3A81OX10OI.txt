Watching this EuroArts DVD reminded me that there are great stylistic differences inevitably imposed by geography on the performance of Classical and Romantic era music. Listening to the Emerson Quartet play two of these quartets, for example, one hears forceful, analytic Mozart. Not inauthentic, just different: Mozart for the New World, perhaps. Listening to the Hagen Quartet play another one of these quartets, on the other hand, one hears a more ambiguous, lyrical Mozart with darker hues in the strings. The Gewandhaus-Quartett are in the latter category. Their Mozart is lyrical, laid-back, somewhat blithe, emotionally ambiguous with darkness at the edges. This seems to be a Mittel Europa style, perhaps a true Mozartean style born of two centuries of experience with this glorious music.These performances were filmed 11-13 May 2005 in the beautiful Baroque castle of Rammenau in Saxony. The Gewandhaus-Quartett are certainly poised to provide a "true" Mozartean performance style. Amazingly, they are the longest continually active string quartet in existence. There has been a Gewandhaus-Quartett in Leipzig since 1809, and since the 1838-39 season it has been an official adjunct of the famous Gewandhaus Orchestra. The present line-up hasn't been together quite that long. Rather, they have been performing together since 1993.The program begins with one of the two "Haydn Quartets" that are presented on this disc: the string quartet no.19 in C Major K.465 "Dissonance". This is followed by the string quartet no.21 in D Major K.575, the first "Prussian" quartet, composed for the cello playing King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia, who had commissioned six quartets following his introduction to Mozart in April 1789 by Prince Karl von Lichnowsky. Next on the program is the Serenade in G Major K.525, "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Finally, first of the "Haydn Quartets", string quartet no.14 in G Major K.387 "Spring". It is a well chosen program of Mozart's finest quartets. I've watched this disc many times and I never tire of this sublime musique du chambre. The Gewandhaus-Quartett seem to hit all the right buttons, emphasizing the lyricism as well as emotional ambiguity and drama that is the hallmark of Mozart's finest mature work. If you have any interest in Mozart's string quartets, or if you desire a good introduction to the glorious music that awaits you, this disc is a fine place to start.The picture format of this DVD is NTSC with a region code of 0 worldwide. The film is shot in 16/9 anamorphic widescreen and looks beautiful. The sound formats available are PCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Digital Surround. The DTS 5.1 sounds crystalline with rich presence and superb spatial localization of the strings. The Dolby 5.1, slightly less focused is nonetheless equally present and clear. PCM stereo is also excellent, though obviously less spatially deep. There are the usual menus. Extras include a short photo documentary about the recording: Behind the Scenes. Running time of this disc is 102 minutes.This is an excellent DVD of some of the finest string quartets ever composed. I enjoy this disc immensely. Very strongly recommended for everyone, especially for lovers of Mozart and chamber music.Mike Birman
