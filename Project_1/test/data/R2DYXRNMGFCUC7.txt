All this movie is is a group of professors in a cabin talking. That's it. Sounds boring? Well if you HAVE to have explosions and punchy one-liners then maybe it will be for you. But just like a masterful Akira Kurosawa film the simplicity of this format belies a movie that can get you swept away if you let it. The real meat of the movie is in the script and dialog. The plot in a nutshell is John, a professor of ten years with a university, decides to leave and gives a send off for his fellow professors. It is then that he decides to tell them he has actually lived for 14,000 years. Did I give away the movie? Nah. That's given away in the first ten minutes of the film. What follows is a intense discussion on what John's claims implies. This being a room full of professors just makes the conversation that much more interesting. Each of the professors bring to the table not only their expertise in their field, but also varying personalities and statures on how they take the revelation that John is pretty much a caveman. This ranges from analytical interest, self-posturing doubt, light-hearted banter, skeptical interest, and outright denial. The actors selected make up a good cast. You get to see John Billingsley of Star Trek Enterprise fame out of his Dr. Flox makeup, which was a treat for this sci-fi fan. Candyman's Tony Todd (who was on a couple Star Trek DS9 episodes) makes for a good foundation character. Richard Riehle from Office Space comes out with a pretty impressive performance overall (IMDB says he was on some Star Trek episodes too... do I detect a pattern?). David Lee Smith as our Caveman John gives a solid if understated performance (IMDB says he was on ST: Voyager. There is a pattern!). What this all culminates into is some pretty deep discussions about our perceptions of history and religion as well as topics like mortality, society, psychology and some interesting thoughts on how John lives as long as he has. Really. This can draw you in and even shock you.  Let me be the first to say this is a low budget movie in many levels. Even though the film was released just a few years ago it has the look of something made much longer than that. If I didn't know better I probably would have pegged this a late 90's low budget movie. That's how low budget it is. It's not just the fact every happens on or around a cabin in the woods, but the lighting and cinematography also make it feel dated. The soundtrack is practically muted and unmemorable. Just saying this so you will be prepared for it. This fact really doesn't detract from the movie. The Blu-Ray transfer is... well... better than the DVD. However that doesn't mean much. The transfer for most is going to look horrible if you're used to the latest high definition transfers. I have to admit they could have done better, or maybe at least try to do some remastering. As it stands the picture is the best you can get, but only by a margin. Audio is in Dolby 5.1, but that doesn't really matter because the movie's audio doesn't take much advantage of it. No TrueHD, but then again that would have been a waste of bandwidth. You would think with the extra space on a Blu-Ray you would get extras, but that is not to be. Not even the extras from the DVD were transferred over. None of the commentaries. None of the four documentaries and featurettes from the DVD. The Man from Earth is a really amazing film that challenges as much as it provokes deep thought. However if you ask me there isn't enough good in this Blu-Ray to warrant its purchase. The picture is only a little better than the DVD, and I'm betting a good upscaling DVD player will narrow that gap, The audio is the same. Worst of all none of the special features and commentaries from the DVD. If you REALLY want it in high definition I would wait until they make a proper release. Otherwise stick with the DVD.
