Purchased this thermometer along with the CDN IRXL220 Large Dial Insta-Read Thermometer.  I use the Large Dial for roasts and this one for poultry (this thermometer's sensing part extends from its tip for 3/4 of an inch which works better for the thinner poultry meat).  I tested both of them out of the box on a glass of ice water and a pot of boiling water. The readings were right on at 32 and 212 degress plus or minus a smidgen of a degree. So far, this thermometer works well and has not given me any problems.  Its hold feature comes in handy when you need to get to a better light source to read the temperature.
