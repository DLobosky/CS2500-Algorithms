However, BELIEVE ME PEOPLE, it is well worth it and I am definitely not one to throw money around left and right for little or no benefit. I love VALUE and the value factor with this unit is excellent.I returned the Honeywell unit because, quite frankly, folks, it was too noisy. Even on the low setting, it sounded like a big whooshing floor box fan on at least medium if not high. It was white-noise-ish but it still interfered with TV watching to an annoying degree. On the other hand, if you WANT white noise, by all means go for that unit.As soon as I packed that thing up to send back, I ordered this, the Sharp Plasmacluster FP-N60CX unit, and could not be happier. With the Sharp rebate available plus a special Valentine's day discount from Amazon, I was able to get it for a final bill of two hundred thirty eight. Sweet!The Sharp unit is significantly more advanced: it kills bacteria and certain viruses (like influenza) with the plasmacluster feature, has separate pollen and dust sensors which will kick the unit on and off depending on environmental pollution, has a remote control that I can program into my learning remote (SO AWESOME to be able to sit on the couch, press a button on a remote to turn the display on to see the air quality (good, slightly impure or very impure) and then turn the display back off), etc.The Honeywell unit, on the other hand, simply had a low, medium, high and off turn-switch you had to set manually, no automatic adjustment, no smart sensors, etc.One nice thing about this over the Honeywell is that this unit is relatively flat. It will close to the wall and be unobtrusive. The Honeywell is this stout little pot of a barrel-like thing...feels like you're wasting space. So I am really digging the Sharp unit.Also, a big deal was this (pay attention): The replacement charcoal filters for the Honeywell unit run about $11 online, and you must replace every three months for the odor removal to keep working. That is $44 per year.On the other hand, the Sharp unit's charcoal filter is WASHABLE and lasts 5 years. This is a consumables savings of $220! That is almost what I PAID for this unit. If the price difference is LESS than this $220, and you want to retain the smell removal, the Sharp is CLEARLY the better choice!The increase in price of one hundred dollars final after rebates was well worth it for the Sharp unit.All that said, the Honeywell unit did give that "fresh moutaintop air" feel to the air in my house. The Sharp just does it even better, though. Oh and I am happy to report no itchy, scratchy problems from cat dander. Have been almost completely itch-free for two weeks now. Sweet.
