Legend tells of a hideous beast, the Loreley, that must set out to kill seven young women and consume their hearts during each full moon in order to return to her youthful slumber. When the legend comes to life in a small village off of the Rhine, it is up to a local hunter to destroy the beast before it disappears once more! Ossorio taps into Lovecraftian lore and mythic tales from the sea in order to bring his seductive siren to life. Unlike in his undead features, which focus on building a terrifying mood and thrilling suspense, LORELEY relies far more heavily on its shocking gore to set up its scares. The beast shreds its victims' skins and rips their beating hearts from their rib cages in graphic detail! One cannot overlook the artistic touch that Ossorio instills in each of his shots, a skill he uses to create a number of atmospheric moments along the riverbanks of the Rhine. Unfortunately, the creature's costume appears to be very cheaply made, and would have been far more effective if it had been left in the shadows. Fans of DAGON and THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM are sure to enjoy this lost Spanish gem!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies
