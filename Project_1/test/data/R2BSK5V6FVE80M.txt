I first saw &quot;The Office&quot; while channel surfing.I didn't know what it was,exactly,as it had a documentary feel.But when David the sleazy boss opened his mouth,I knew that I was watching the greatest thing since Mystery Science Theater 3000.The acting is superb,especially by the actor who portrays David,the mealy-mouthed sleazoid,lying,humorless(although he thinks he is a comic genius),twit boss of the office.This man is I think,the best actor I have ever watched,film and television included.He really is.And he does it so effortlessly.He also co-writes the show and has no qualms about making his character out to be an embarrassment to humankind.It's wonderful.All of the actors are &quot;spot on,&quot; as the British say,and the acting and lines are so good,you may find yourself cringing in embarrassment..really..it's painful to watch,but in a pleasing masochistic way,if you get my drift.If you like superb ensemble acting,and some of the best laugh/cringe -inducing dialog ever written for tv,or any media,you must check this out.You will not be disappointed.
