In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster.   The cast is good.  Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas.  In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character.  Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him lots of screen time.  Hard to believe now how unknown Bloom was before Fellowship of the Ring came out.  The movie does have its faults.  I thought the scene of the fight on the Moria stairs pushed the limits of plausibility.  I also thought Boromir's death scene was overdone; I can do without endless slow motion shots of striking arrows.  As to the extra shots in the DVD, some were good, while with others I tend to agree with the original decision to leave them out.  The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism.  They also have a more serious message.  Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside.  This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up.  Is this really what we want?  Is it making us happier?  Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.
