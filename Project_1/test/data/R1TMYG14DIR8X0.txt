It's rare that I'll religiously watch a drama such as this while it's on TV, as I usually prefer to wait for the release of the DVDs so I can watch the entire season in a short period of time - the fact that I made an exception for Rome is a tribute to this excellent HBO series.  Series One begins with Caesar's return to Rome (from fighting in Gaul), follows his struggle for and ultimate rise to power, and culminates in his assassination (yeah, I generally avoid spoilers in my reviews but don't tell me you didn't see that one coming - don't worry there's plenty more to the story).  The audience is presented with a more or less omnipotent viewpoint, but the story is skewed towards the perspective of two Roman soldiers - Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo.  Vorenus and Pullo were real Roman soldiers (and were in fact mentioned in writings from Caesar himself), although I'm assuming the continuous and important roles they play throughout the series are mostly fictitious.  Vorenus begins the story as a disciplined soldier that follows the straight and narrow, although he eventually develops some personal problems and, err, anger management issues that add to the story.  His loyal companion, Pullo, is a well intentioned but pea-brained (although likable) brute.  Both are great characters, and the way they are utilized by Rome's creators to bridge the gap between ruling class and commoner is simply brilliant. Sure, Rome is a bit sensationalized and has lots of sex and violence, but if offers much more than that.  It has a complex storyline rife with political struggles, betrayal, family disputes, war, and yes, sex and violence.  It's also visually stunning (it's little wonder the show was so expensive to produce), and it's packed with excellent, memorable characters.  Do not be led to believe that the prevalence of sex and violence makes this a brainless, plotless, predictable action flick, because it is much more than that - it's truly a great and well-told story. I'll admit I was disappointed to learn that Season 2 would wrap up the highly enjoyable Rome series.  I'll miss it.  On the other hand, Rome tells a great story and it tells it well, and it then it ends - and that can be a good thing.  Too many good television series continue to run long past the point where the story has been told, and simply fade into mediocrity.  At least Rome isn't doing that.  But the fact that I won't be able to watch any new episodes of Rome makes me envy those of you who are new to this excellent series that much more.  In short - if you enjoy good drama and aren't offended by a little sex and violence, Rome is a must see series.  The DVDs are definitely worth purchasing.
