Those are intended to both inform and entertain. This is strictly for information, they makeno effort to entertain anyone. There are no flashy CGI special effects. It simply tells what we know (or think we know) aboutearly man and human evolution. There is little in the way of speculation and no attempt at drama.Great for high school classes or anyone who is interested in what is known about early man.
