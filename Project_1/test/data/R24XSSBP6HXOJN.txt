Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie. I've watched "Sabrina" a lot of times, and I always enjoy it. Perhaps the appeal is seeing a wealthy man do the right thing for a change. The chauffeur's daughter returns home from college in France and dazzles the two wealthy brothers at the family estate. From there, the romance and adventure begins.Great fun and highly recommended, and here is another great "chick flick" that men will enjoy, "A Walk in the Clouds."
