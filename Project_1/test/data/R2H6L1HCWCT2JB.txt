Putting them in the little spring bag provided, they NEVER get tangled up. My old Sonys were forever tangling every time I used them. The cords to the ear pieces seem very sturdy. With three choices of rubber tips, I used the medium size and the fit was great & very comfortable.The sound is great & when I pumped up the bass, that was excellent as well.I bought these for twenty-five dollars after a five-dollar online rebate. At BB, they were sixty. What a deal!These are, without a doubt, the nicest & best quality earbuds I've ever owned and at an unbeatable price.
