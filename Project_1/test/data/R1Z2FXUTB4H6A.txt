She tells him that she doesn't want to say anything on the phone, but she'll explain everything. He doesn't want to go, but he does. He he arrives home, he sees his mother's body on the floor. The killers are still there and go after Evan.  While he's being chased his world started to fall a part. He has to figure out who's killed his mom, and after him, and find his father. He can't trust anyone because people all around him are lying to him. He soon learns that his parents aren't who he thought they were. As he learns the truth, more and more people are after him, and he has to figure out why.That's pretty much an over view of the plot.Over all it was an okay read that started off so good, but then gets silly.   When I found out the truth on what was going on, and the reason's why Evan's mom was killed, and his parents past, it was just so silly.  I didn't mind it that it was so far fetched, but I didn't think it was logical.   The more I learned about Evan and his family, the less I cared.The characters were okay, but kind of flat. There was one person who was afraid of snakes, but nothing was made of that.If you want to read it, I suggest you get it at the library.
