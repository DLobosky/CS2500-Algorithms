Similar films include "The Searchers" (1956) in which the Duke hunts down the Indians who killed his brother and family and kidnapped his niece,  "The Bravados" (1958) in which Gregory Peck hunts the men who killed his wife, and "Hang em High" (1968) in which Clint Eastwood hunts down the men who tried to hang him. In this case, a Confederate officer (Gary Cooper) hunts down the brothers (Raymond Massey, Steve Cochran) who killed his family.Gary Cooper (1901-61) is a film icon, ranked #11 in AFI's list of 100 top male stars.  Nominated 5 times for an Oscar, he won twice ("Sergeant York" and "High Noon"). His films were in the top 10 box office 18 times between 1936 and 1957, a record surpassed only by John Wayne. Despite appearing in a variety of films, Cooper is best remembered for his westerns ("The Plainsman", "The Westerner", "Vera Cruz", "High Noon", "Man of the West")Beautiful and sultry Ruth Roman (1922-99) is best remembered for her Golden Globe nominated role in "Champion" (1949). She made 50+ films before transitioning to TV in the late 50s where she had recurring roles in "The Long Hot Summer" (1965-6), "Gunsmoke" (1969-71), "Knotts Landing" (1986-7) and "Murder She Wrote" (1987-9).The great Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays a real estate magnet with a clouded past. Massey is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" (1940), "The Day Lincoln was Shot" (1950) and "How the West Was Won" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series "Dr Kildare" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in "Santa Fe Trail" (1940). Dark and handsome Steve Cochran (1917-65) debuted in "Wonder Man" (1945) as a heavy and did such a good job he continued to be the heavy in dozens of films. I remember him best as James Cagney's treacherous sidekick from "White Heat" (1949). He claimed -  "The big secret in playing a gangster in movies is to really believe that the character you are playing is doing no wrong."Stuart Heisler (1896-1979) directs. He made a dozen or so films between 1936 and 1956 and then transitioned to TV where he worked on westerns like "Rawhide" and "Lawman".Between 1935 and 1956 Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for "Since You Went Away" (1944), "Now Voyager" (1942), and "The Informer" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for "All About Eve" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), "Cyrano" (Actor) and "Born yesterday" (Actress).  The top grossers included "Cinderella", "King Solomon's Mines", "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Sunset Boulevard". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  "The Asphalt Jungle", "Cheaper by the Dozen", "The Glass Menagerie", "Rashomon", "The Third Man", and "Twelve O'Clock High". Westerns were popular with films like "Ambush", "Broken Arrow", "The Gunfighter" and "Winchester 73".The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said "Except for a few clever "gimmicks" that are dropped here and there in the tale, this is one of those two-gun-man horse operas that comes right down from William S. Hart."Dallas is a pretty good B western, but that's all it is. Cooper had done work in many other westerns, as have Massey and Cochran.
