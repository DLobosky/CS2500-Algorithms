So then, when the "Best-Of" disk doesn't do much business, Fox can say, "See, there's not much interest," and use it as an excuse not to release Season Two.  A much better test would be a Best of Season TWO disk.When you see the god-awful crud that's being released on DVD (Fear Factor??  Survivor??), you just know there's more going on in the business of these shows than appears on the surface.  "WKRP in Cincinatti," which I believe has some of the same corporate relationships as MTM, has also not been released on DVD.  It would be nice to know what the real problem is.
