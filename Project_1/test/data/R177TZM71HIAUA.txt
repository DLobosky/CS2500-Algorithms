A huge problem that erotica, or even outright pornography, has is also working as fiction that has a plot, character development, and feeling.  What it does best instead is sexually arouse you.  The only work that has ever totally transcended this barrier is my favorite film, &quot;Last Tango In Paris.&quot;  It manages to be a first rate work of art while also being sexually explicit and obsessed throughout. &quot;Last Tango&quot; need not fear any competition from this anthology.  This anthology is sexually arousing for women but does not take the place of well-written historical romance.  The novellas are different enough that there is something for probably most women's sexual taste. Schone's is the best written and works best as romantic fiction but is not as sexually arousing as Small's or Devine's. Small's novella is very kinky and the prose is so purple, I found myself breaking into laughter at certain spots.  In fact, it almost reads like a parody of romance crossed with erotica. However, from a sexual standpoint, it works.  She sets a kinky scene and plays it out for maximum effect.  I can see why she sells so many books. I can't take much of Thea Devine but her stream of consciousness style also basically works as sexually arousing writing. I also found myself breaking into laughter at several absurd junctures while reading her work.  I tried reading the Susan Johnson novella but found it boring.  I tried reading it after the Small and Devine though and it didn't compare well as arousing material to those.  However, it was not balanced by being converted into otherwise readable romantic fiction either.  The Johnson scores the lowest for me and I didn't finish it.  I'm not sure Robin Schone is doing herself a favor by featuring her work with the other three authors.  She is the only one of the four trying to walk the tightrope between romantic fiction and outright erotica.  She succeeds better with her unique combination when she is on her own and in novel length. I've read one novel apiece for each author except Johnson.  I've read several novels by Johnson and liked her earlier work very well but not her work written after her novel, &quot;Wicked.&quot; I've put a four star grade on this work because I'm comparing it to other erotica.  If I were compelled to grade it as romantic fiction and as writing, the anthology as a whole would probably only merit two stars.
