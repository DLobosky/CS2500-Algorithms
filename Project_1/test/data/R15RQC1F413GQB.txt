It couples well with the Manfrotto 026 adapter, and has the height range for all my portraiture needs. There are no sharp edges, and everything feels just right when I'm assembling it. It's also a breeze to put up as well as to put away.Unfortunately, this portability might also be its major con - the stand may not be stable enough in less than favorable conditions. This has not been an issue for me as I tend to use it primarily in indoor scenarios, but I can't imagine this as being usable outdoors especially with an umbrella attached. For me portability was key - so I'm a happy customer.Note that I use this adapter in conjunction with a Manfrotto 026 Swivel Lite-Tite Umbrella Adapter, Westcott 43" Optical White Satin Collapsible Umbrella, and a Stroboframe Bracket Shoe Mount. This combination works exceedingly well for my purposes.Happy Strobing!~Damodar
