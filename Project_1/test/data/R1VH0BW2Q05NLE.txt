It fits well, looks cute, and doesn't add any bulk (it's thicker than a skin, but since it's not really meant to protect the phone from falls like a silicone case is, the plastic is very thin). It will not protect the phone from major falls, but it will protect it from nicks and scratches and corner-dents from shorter falls (or the scratches that the phone accumulates just by having it in a handbag or in a pocket next to keys, or whatever). Bottom line: cute, can change colors by changing cases, doesn't add bulk, but will not protect the phone from major falls and is very slippery.
