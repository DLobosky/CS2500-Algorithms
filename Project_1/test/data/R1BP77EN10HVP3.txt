I keep several copies of it so that I can give them away whenever I meet a special child who I think would appreciate it.You can read the other reviews if you want to know the story line... nothing can do it justice, however, except just reading it.  When you start, you won't want the story to end, and when it does, you will be sad that the world - and relationships - aren't really as beautiful as they are in the book.This is an absolute MUST READ for any child.  Or adult.
