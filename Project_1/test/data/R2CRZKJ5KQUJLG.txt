If you own an IPAD, you know how quickly you can go through the charge on the battery.  The same is true of the IPOD if you are using it as an entertainment device (say, Angry Birds to keep the kids happy).  You also know how easy it is to miss charging it back up overnight.So, what to do?  Well, you can now plug this charger into your power outlet in your car and can recharge the battery in either device.  I have used the charger to bring my IPAD from 20 percent charge remaining back up to 100% charge remaining on a long drive.  Keep in mind that this charger will NOT charge your device any faster than the manufacturer (Apple in this case) supplied wall charger.  You just need to remember to use the port labeled with an A for Apple on it.  That port is capable of the 2A charge rate that your IPOD requires to charge correctly.  This charger is black in color.  The company also makes the same charger in White.The second port on the unit is a 1A charge port that readily handles my Sanyo phone at the same time.  One of the things to keep in mind is that you want to match up the charge rate of the charger with the requirements of your device.  If you look at your wall charger for you device, you will find the charge rating for it.  Match that up with the correct port on this vehicle charger and you are good to go.  You can always plug a lower charge rate device into a higher rated port, but not necessarily do the reverse.  Some devices may work in a lower rated charger port, they will just charge VERY slowly.  Other devices such as the IPAD will probably give you a message that the charger is incompatible with your device if you use the incorrectly rated port.Even on a long charge time (IPAD-new version) and using the second port to charge my Sanyo phone, this unit did not get more than just warm to the touch.  It plugs into the power port on my Toyota without problems, is solid in the port, and it removes easily.  This power unit is smaller than some of the ones that I have used previously, but it still sticks out past the dash.I have learned from experience from using other chargers to NOT leave a charger plugged into a power port when you start a vehicle.  I also do not leave one plugged in when shutting off a hybrid.  I have found that power surges can occur and that it can damage your charger.This is a very well made device and I would highly recommend it as long as it has the charge rating you require for your device.  Keep in mind that there are NO power cords provided.  You will need to use your normal USB power cord that you have for your current device (IPOD, IPAD, PHONE, ETC.).
