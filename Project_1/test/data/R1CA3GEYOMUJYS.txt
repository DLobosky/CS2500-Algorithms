A...A...a...a...What Begins With A?  Aunt Annies Aligator, A..A..aBig B, little B, what begins with B? Barber, Baby, Bubbles and a Bumble bee.Twenty-six stanzas of this whimsey creates a great learning opportunity for your kid.  I've taught three of my four kids the alphabet with this gem from Dr. Seuss and my fourth is starting to assualt me at every opportunity with this classic.The art is typical Seuss, the letter lessons are clever and whimsical rhymes and the cadence is perfect (I've even found myself reciting the entire book aloud on long car trips to quiet the troops -- it will burn into your memory in no time).This is a great and easy way to teach your child his or her ABC's and a love of books at an early age.Highly recommended.
