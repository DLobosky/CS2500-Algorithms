"Fire in the Morning" was a minor hit, and her take on "Whenever I Call You Friend" is a more mellow version of the song she co-wrote with Kenny Loggins -- reportedly they differed over how the song should be performed, so they each recorded their own versions.  But the song that makes this album so sublime is "Lights of Dawn."  A simple arrangement makes room for probably the best vocal performance of Melissa Manchester's career.This album was issued on CD back in 1984 or 1985, and was one of the few Melissa Manchester albums ever made available on CD for years.  It didn't remain in print for long, and became a true collector's item.  This Wounded Bird Records reissue finally brings it back in print, sounding much the same as the original issue.Three bonus tracks were included on this reissue, but none of these bonus tracks really makes sense here -- they weren't recording at the same time as the album.  The first bonus track is "We Had This Time," which was the b-side to the single "Don't Cry Out Loud" in 1978.  This track was included as a bonus track on the 2002 reissue of DON'T CRY OUT LOUD, so why it was included on this reissue and not on the 2007 reissue of DON'T CRY OUT LOUD is a total mystery.The second bonus track, "Nice Girls," is a song recorded in 1983 and included on GREATEST HITS.  Stylistically, it really doesn't fit in here, even though it is nice to have it in print again.The third bonus track is the only real "find" here -- it is the single version of "O Heaven (How You've Changed Me)."  Released in 1974, the album version of the song is from BRIGHT EYES, and it a completely different recording than this single version.  To my knowledge, this is the first time the single version has appeared on a CD.  Again, why this was included here rather than on the CD reissue of BRIGHT EYES doesn't make any sense, but at least we get this version of the song on CD...Unfortunately, the liner notes are extremely minimal (the previous CD issue at least had all the song lyrics), but we've come to expect only the very least from Wounded Bird Records.  It would have been so nice if they had included Melissa's tracks from the soundtrack to THE PROMISE, which was also released in 1979, but it'll take a better record label to get that done, I'm afraid.Still, this is definitely worth getting on CD.  Disco influences and all.  It is an underrated classic, and one of my favorite albums by the sublime Melissa Manchester.
