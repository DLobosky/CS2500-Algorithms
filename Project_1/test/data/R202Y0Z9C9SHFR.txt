If you're not sure about it, catch a couple episodes online, or worst case, rent season 1.The writers realized that their show was on the bubble, so they went all out the 2nd half of season 2, and they did a really great job.  I could just repeat what others have said, but there's really not much point.  It really is a cool show, and if someone checks it out, they will probably like it.  I converted my parents into becoming Chuck fans, and now I'm working on my sister and her hubby.One final note.  Look at all the 5 star reviews (and the percent that are 5 stars) that Amazon is getting on Chuck.  That should give you a hint as to how good the show really is...I also agree with others about the price of the DVDs.  I see that Amazon's DVD price has dropped to $38.99, but that's still a bit high...
