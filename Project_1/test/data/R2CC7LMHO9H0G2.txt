We walked everywhere, constantly unfolding the map of each section of the city to find out how to get to where we needed to go.PROS:1. Compact - fits in purse or jacket pocket. Easy to unfold and refold each map.2. Excellent map detail - shows all streets, Metro stops, important buildings and points of interest. Also has a separate Metro map.3. Contains other useful information - not a substitute for a guidebook, but the back of each map provides short descriptions of major attractions, restaurants, etc. This is useful when you're in an area and you want to know what else you should see while you're there.CONS:1. Metro lines are not shown on maps - the Metro stops are shown on the street maps, but sometimes it was difficult to relate the street maps to the separate Metro map.  If the Metro routes were superimposed on the street maps, this would have been a lot easier (although this may be a difficult thing to do while keeping the maps readable).
