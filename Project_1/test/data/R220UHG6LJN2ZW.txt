Let me start off by saying that I am a big Asterix fan. So it should come as no suprise that I loved this book. :) Though this is a First edition 2003 publication, it was originally released in French in 1996.This book contains fourteen short stories including tales of: The day Asterix and Obleix were born; How Oblix goes back to school; Fashion in Ancient Gaul; How Dogmatix helps the village cockeral win a duel;  How Dogmatix is adopted as a Roman mascot; Asterix as you've never seen him before; Obleix's adventures under the mistletoe; The bid for the very first Gaulish Olympics; The birth of an idea - the story of the creation of Asterix, and much more. I especially like seeing Oblix's family tree branching to the modern day. An enjoyable read.
