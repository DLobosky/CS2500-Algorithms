

The Amazon Editorial Review is incorrect and misleading.  The included CD does not offer guidance on two of the sixteen arrangements.  No instruction on either "I Saw Her Standing There" or "Little Wing" is given.  Since I bought the book for tips on how to play I Saw Her Standing There, I am very disappointed.
