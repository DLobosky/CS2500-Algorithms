

K Is for Kite: God's Springtime Alphabet, written by Kathy-jo Wargin, is a picture book that illustrates each letter of the alphabet with something relating to springtime and to the concept of a world made by God. The author provides both a word and a short poem for each letter. For instance, the letter "F" is for "Feast." The accompanying text reads: "With family and friends we will Feast as we should. We're thankful to God who gives all that is good." Each letter is used in this manner, even the tricky letter "Q," which in this case is for "Quack."Although the people represented in the painted illustrations by Kim Gatto look a bit stilted and stiff, the bright, bold colors used throughout the book will be sure to please young and old alike.What I Like: I like the bright colors used in the illustrations. And, even though I'm not a big fan of rhyming text, this one is done very well.What I Dislike: The only thing I would add is a Bible reference of some kind for the text.Overall Rating: Very good.Christine M.
