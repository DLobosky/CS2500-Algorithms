The tested throughput on the 5 GHz band was 129 Mbps up and 148 Mbps down (laptop with Intel 6300 wifi card to a server with a wired connection). About 15% faster then my old WNDR3700 router, but I was hoping for a 50% increase (300 Mbps -> 450 Mbps).*	Easy to setup with the `Cisco Connect' application. The application guides you in setting up the wireless security, parental control, and guest network. *	No issues connecting to the router with my PS3, Windows Home Server, Vulkano, and iPadCon:*	Only 2 data stream (300 Mbps) on the 2.4 GHz band. The tested throughput on the 2.4 GHz band was 60 Mbps up and 70 Mbps down*	No extra features like WDS repeating/bridge*	WNDR4000 has better parental control featuresSummary:Having the E4200 and WNDR4000, the E4200 has roughly the same throughput performance as the WNDR4000 (134 Mbps up and 140 Mbps down on the 5 GHz band). The difference between the two comes down to features. The E4200 has a great setup utility that will allow any newbie to configure the router with ease. The WNDR4000 provides more useful features such as WDS repeating and traffic meter. As for the range of the router, I really can't comment on it due to living in a small apartment.Some extra background info:One thing that I feel is missing in the `router comparison table' is the processor speed. The CPU speed gives you an idea about the performance of the router. So here is what I found on the internet.E1200 - 300 MHz CPU with 32MB RAM and  4MB FlashE1500 - 300 MHz CPU with 32MB RAM and  8MB FlashE2500 - 300 MHz CPU with 64MB RAM and  8MB FlashE3000 - 480 MHz CPU with 64MB RAM and  8MB FlashE4200 - 480 MHz CPU with 64MB RAM and 16MB Flash
