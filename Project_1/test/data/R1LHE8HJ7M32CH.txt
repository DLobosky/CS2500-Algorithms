I got into Voyager after catching its daily reruns, and in IMO it's a very good show. The loss of Kess in season 4 and the addition of Seven turned out to be great for the show, as Seven became one of the best characters, and provided some of the shows best storylines. This show also has the advantage of being able to introduce a lot of new threats and aliens, since it takes place in a different part of the galaxy. The shows overall theme of "getting home" spans the shows 7 seasons, and is well done. The collection is made up of the individual seasons and the packaging is not very good.
