The quality of the watch is very good, with one minor issue, which I'll describe below.The 42mm stainless steel case feels very solid.  This is a watch that will last a long time.  Although hard to see from the Amazon photo, the watch appears to be two pieces of steel bolted together by the four hexagonal bolts visible from the face.  However, it's not apparent as to whether or not these are functional or just for looks.  I didn't want to try and loosen them!!  When looking at the watch from the side, you see a very round watch.  My only negative comment is that the edges of the case seem somewhat sharp.  Definitely not sharp enough to cut something, but I would have expected a much more chamfered edge.  It's minor, but noticeable.  The see-through case-back shows the well known red rotor and the Oris 645 (modified ETA 2836).As is on nearly all Oris watches, the crown is substantial.  This one has a spiral-like etched surface, which not only looks nice but allows for an easy grip.  The crown doesn't screw down, but does features Oris Quick Lock system, which I feel is better then the screw-down, especially given this is not a diver watch.The face is incredibly easy to see due to the contrasting colors.  The sapphire crystal is slightly domed and has anti-reflective coating on the inside.  No doubt it makes the face very easy to see.  The partially exposed date ring is an interesting touch.  I was concerned that it would be confusing to see the correct date, but I didn't have any issues.  The small second hand moves very smoothly.  I love the pointer day.  It's a really great feature.  Since the pointer has red marking, it's very easy to see what day it is.Finally, the leather strap has a very firm stainless steel clasp.  It's very easy to take on/off and resize.  The white stitching is the perfect touch as it goes well with the face.  There is also a stainless steel bracelet option, but it really changes the look of the watch.  I think it makes the watch look smaller.This is a really fantastic watch which I would highly recommend for anyone that's interested in a everyday or weekend sports watch.  Oris quality and design is very well demonstrated.  If you don't have an Oris watch in your collection, this could be the perfect first watch.
