This set packs over 30 hours of "classic" Sci-Fi movies and shows on to 2 double sided disks, I wasn't expecting much from this set because the price was soo low, but I have been pleasantly surprised to find the prints are half way decent and watchable, not great, but not bad at all for so much content for so little.
