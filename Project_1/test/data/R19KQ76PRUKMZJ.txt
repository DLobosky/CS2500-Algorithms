This story derives from a mythological world that Tolkien had in his mind long before The Hobbit was written.  Even 20 years or so before he wrote The Hobbit he was doing writings on this world of his.  When The Hobbit was successful he was asked to do a sequel.  His plan was to put out the Silmarillion and LOTR as one giant book so that his whole world could be explained.  This caused problems for himself and LOTR ended up taking many years to write.  He worked on the Silmarillion for the entire rest of his life and it was never fully completed.  Luckily LOTR came out and we at least have that fully published.  Christopher Tolkien decided to publish The Silmarillion after his father passed since he knew there was so much information in there.  He took historical records his father had written on Middle-Earth, other writings that he had written throughout his life like structures of how The Silmarillion should be done, many poems on Middle-Earth, and combined them to make the most complete Silmarillion book that he possibly could.  He did a good job but it still seemed too short.  Next he published The History of Middle-Earth books(1-12) to try and help people get as much understanding of his father's world as they can.  You may think that it would be better to read The Silmarillion first since it is pre-LOTR and you would be right.  Here is the exact order I would read the Middle-Earth books if I just would have known how deep this world was before I started. 1-start with The Silmarillion and stop when you hit the chapter 'The Fall of Gondolin' AND DON'T READ IT YET.2-in the 'Unfinished Tales' book read the first chapter 'Of Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin'.3-after that in 'The Book of Lost Tales 2' read the chapter 'The Fall of Gondolin''4-now pick up 'The Silmarillion' where you left off and it will give you a breif recap of what you just read and the recap will help get you back into the exact names that 'The Silmarillion' uses.  You will see name changes because Tolkien was always redoing his stories and changing names.  Also, the last chapter called 'Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age' SHOULD NOT BE READ YET.  It is a very good writing, but it would spoil the entire Lord of the Rings experience.5-After you finish 'The Silmarillion' I would read 'The Hobbit'.  It is a quick read and then you can move on to The LOTR and get a lot more out of it.   If this seems a bit much and you don't want to have to get 3 or 4 other books then just pick up LOTR, and 'The Hobbit' if you want.  If you have seen the movie and loved it then you may like the books even more.  The ending is a lot different and overall LOTR remains my favorite book ever.  I kind of wish I would have never read it because every single book I have ever read now I always say that it was nowhere near as good as The Lord of the Rings.
