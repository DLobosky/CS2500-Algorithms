I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today.I also suggest you buy "The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Watching the shows is one thing, knowing the behind-the-scenes stuff is even more fun. Both are available on Amazon.
