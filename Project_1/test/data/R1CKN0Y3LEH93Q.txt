The "surround sound" feature lives up to its billing. I've tried other earbuds and none can match the sound.The earbuds I purchased came with two sets of inserts - one straight and one tapered - to achieve the level of comfort you're looking for. The tapered insert works great with my ears. They are comfortable and *never* fall out no matter how vigourous the motion. Even an incidental light tug on the cord doesn't dislodge the earbud.So if you're looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds that are comfortable and stay in your ear - this is what you should buy.
