Such "financial products" enrich those selling them by up to 10% of what the investor (victim) puts in, with possible trail options (even more payout later to the salesperson).  Fixed annuities with long surrender periods pay the highest commissions and have poor track records.  In this book, Schwarz explains how insurance companies take advantage of people with these annuity products that generate such high commissions for brokers.  He is sensitive to morality issues.Common Sense is among other things a way to reach potential investors.  I'm not in any of the author's Ave Maria funds.  It appears to me they are fair in an industry with a tilted playing field.  The 6 Ave Maria Funds don't use front end sales loads or deferred sales loads to encourage brokers to sell their funds.  Category averages for such pernicious loads are about 5.3% and 2.25% (for a total of 7.55%) - that's how low the bar has been set.  Paying loads on regular mutual funds is detrimental to one's financial health.  Just to see for myself whether Schwarz investing techniques work in the real world, I very briefly looked at all 6 Ave Maria mutual funds on some web sites.  All 6 of them are either (as I write this) at all-time highs or very close to all-time highs per their long-term graphs.  Also, two are rated 5-star by Morningstar (their growth and rising dividend funds).  Morningstar rates one as 4-star (the bond fund); one 3-star (Catholic values); and their world equity fund is apparently too new to have a rating.  Of these, only 2 funds have a potential 12b1 fee, the growth and Catholic values funds.  Nobody likes to pay 12b1 fees.  Fortunately, there are ways to avoid 12b1 fees and do not let anybody tell you otherwise.Good Returns makes for relatively easy reading.  Topics include biographical information on the author; reconciliation of religious values with investing; value investing; how politics affect markets; and the current predicament of the U.S. economy.  Schwarz is candid to a fault.  He has strong opinions on several matters.  I disagreed with a lot of his opinions.  However, I expect people that manage other people's money, and potentially mine, to be forthright.  I recommend Common Sense for the approach to treating investors.  There is a fairness here that seems reassuring.
