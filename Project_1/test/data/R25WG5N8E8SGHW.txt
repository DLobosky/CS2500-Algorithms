So if you have a question about whether this video will be helpful for you, my guess is that it will.  Having watched this DVD, I wanted to leave a review partly to respond to the comment that this video is boring. The video series is not a bunch of Disney movies trying to have a moral, nor are they high budget Hollywood production films of meaningless fluff. What is in this DVD is an amazing amount of insight that will come in handy for anyone who is trying to overcome an addiction, has a loved one with an addiction, or is trying to learn something on the subject.
