In the short time I've had it, though, it works really well!Like other reviewers, I really wanted to buy a Clarisonic brush, but couldn't justify spending that much on a tool that is essentially just a glorified face cleaner.  (I usually trust the advice of dermatologists Leslie Baumann and Neal Schultz, and they both agreed that it will *not* reduce wrinkles, but will rather just deep clean your skin.)  Although many people think that the the Clarisonic is an exfoliator, it does NOT exfoliate; instead, it deep cleans your skin so that your skin care and anti-aging products can better penetrate the epidermis.  The same is true for this Pretika, and I've found that it does a really good job of cleansing.  I usually have to wash my face twice at night to get rid of makeup -- once with a cleansing oil and then once again with a regular cleaner.  Even after that, I usually find traces of my makeup on the cotton pad I swipe my toner on with.  Since using the Pretika, however, the cotton pad has been completely clean -- with no makeup residue!Since I had read reviews on other sites that said that this Pretika brush is very harsh when compared to the Clarisonic, I was worried that it would be too harsh on my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, but it's just been fine.  I've only been using it once a day (at night, to deep clean and get rid of my makeup) and am still using the sensitive setting, but the brush feels really soft and it hasn't irritated my skin at all.On a final note, one of the biggest selling points for me is that this gets rid of the flaky skin that my Retin-A leaves in its wake.  Twice a week, I've been using the Olay Microdermabrasion kit to get rid of the flakes and it works fantastically for that, but the flaky skin comes back and you can only use the Olay kit twice a week.  The Pretika gets rid of the dry, flaky skin, and leaves my skin feeling really soft.So far, this has been a great purchase.UPDATE ON 3/27/10:  I've cut back to using this just once a day on the sensitive setting since twice a day seemed to be a bit too much for my skin, but it's still working great.  I haven't had to charge it at all since I first bought it.  At the same time that I started using this, I also started using Skin Laboratory's Lactic 35% & Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, and the two products have made a huge difference in my skin!  The blackheads that I've always had on my nose are gone for the first time ever, and my skin looks radiant and fresh.  I'll be sure to update this review again to see it holds up longer than just a few months.UPDATE ON 5/4/10:  I just downgraded my original five-star review to three stars.  I've had this for two months now, and the bristles have developed mold at the bases, even though I dry it off every time I use it.  It also rusts at the base, and I've had to clean that up, too.  I did contact Pretika's customer service about the mold issue, and they assure me that the brushes are anti-microbial and offered to send me replacement brush heads.  So their customer service is really outstanding!  That being said, I really don't know how much longer this brush will last.  Has anyone else experienced this problem with mold growing on it? Does the Clarisonic brush have the same problem?UPDATE ON 12/26/10:  I just received a Clarisonic Mia for Christmas, and the difference between the Clarisonic and the Pretika brush are very noticeable.  The Clarisonic brush is *much* softer, and the sonic vibrations are much stronger.  If you can afford to buy a Mia (which is the less expensive brush that Clarisonic makes), I would recommend getting that one over this Pretika.  For just over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer one.
