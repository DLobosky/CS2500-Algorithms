My regular line has an EXCELLENT Uniden cordless answering system with 4 handsets and has double the features of this phone. The construction quality of THIS phone is about two steps below the two year old Uniden hooked up to my regular line and it has NO HEADPHONE JACK! Had I noticed THAT at the store, I would have passed this model by. I'll edit this review once the phone is fully charged and I've had a chance to use it.Update 12-15-10I now have this phone hooked up to Magic Jack.... I'll install the other Magic Jack when I arrive in Manila next week. At THAT time I will be able to give a nuts and bolts down to earth review of how it works for international calling. The phone works well, but I wish it had a headphone jack on the handset for my wife to use.  Sound quality for this phone is excellent.Update 12-29=10I'm in the Phioippines right now and have hooked up a Magic Jack here too.  I called home to California and had a very clear connection... and no dropped calls.  I guess the dropped call "feature" only applies to calls made using the MagicJack calling card!  So far so good.  Next update when I return to the U.SUpdate Feb 26th, 2010This phone works great for making Magic Jack calls to anywhere within the U.S. AND Canada.  We don't need a Magic Jack for calls to and from the Philippines.  My in-laws now have a number that is a local call for us.  They can call anywhere within the U.S. or Canada too!
