This film is one of the best films that i have seen. The actors are good and Bruce Willis and the little boy who plays a kid who sees ghost are very good actors I have seen this film 3 times and if you haven't seen the film  yet i Suggest you better see it. The ghost in it look so real. It is very  jumping to if you want a scare then watch this film.
