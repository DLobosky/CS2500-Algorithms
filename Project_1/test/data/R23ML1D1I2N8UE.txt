Despite not being particularly impressive songwriters or instrumentalists, The Ramones are still one of the most important bands in the history of rock music. Along with British counterparts The Clash and The Sex Pistols, the Queens quintet spearheaded the punk movement of the late 1970s'. Though lineups changed and personal conflict ocassionally affected their artistic abilities, The Ramones' impact still rings true today.The 85 song, three disc (and bonus dvd) boxed set "Weird Tales Of The Ramones" is ample proof of how important they were. Songs like "Blitzkreig Bop", "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker" and "I Wanna Be Sedated" defined what punk rock music went. In addition to their biggest hits, there's some very underrated album cuts that deserve the attention of beginning fans. Hardcore fans will be attracted to sound quality, which makes these songs sound new again.The comic book structured liner notes are a visual thrill. Very informative, quirky and very funny. This is a truly great compilation of a truly great band.
