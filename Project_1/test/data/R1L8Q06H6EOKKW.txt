Alas, his past is not so eager to forget about him.For myself, I found "Memory" to be far too similar to the first book in this series, "Shadow".  The prose is more polished and the metafores more subtle, but otherwise the content is just more of the same.If you've not read another book in this series, you'll greatly enjoy this work -- 5 stars.  Otherwise, while pleasant, "Memory" offers nothing new.
