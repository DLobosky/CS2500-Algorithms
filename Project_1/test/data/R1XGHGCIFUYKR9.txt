Equilibrium is a movie that is unexpected from all directions. To the Brillian Action Sequences, Performances and Art Direction.The story is set in the near future where people are left to live in the world with no feelings whatsoever, by injecting a new found formula called Prozium. The government belives that feeling such as anger, rage, jealousy etc. are the main causes of people's intolerance to Humanity.Christian Bale is outstanding in this movie. He is very still and rigid which is great, because that's what his character is all about. His best emotions show through when he is at a time in the movie where his feelings and his passion for wanting to live life with feelings are emerging from inside of him. The supporting cast of Taye Diggs and Emily Watson is also great, they both add a feeling of completeness to the whole movie which was great to see.Props goes to the director Kurt Wimmer who wrote and directed the movie with such passion that he also made up a new technique of fighting called 'Gun-Kata'. This method of fighting with guns is brilliant. The action sequences are choreographed prestinely and right on the money. The art of 'Gun-Kata' is all over the place, which isn't bad, because the Photography of the film is shot in a pace that makes you see the Beauty in the Danger. Well Done.The Art Direction of the sets are great. I see lots of symettry and lot's of dark colours of Grey. Lot's of Dark Grey which is great because it hightens the sense of flatness in the charaters' emotionless lives.Equilibrium is something that I've been wanting to see for a while. It left the theatres quickly, but for sure this movie is something worth watching.
