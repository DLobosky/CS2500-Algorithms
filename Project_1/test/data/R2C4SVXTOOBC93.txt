But this has some stars attached, and I'm fairly shallow in that way. The plot: "Two couples are trekking in a remote island location where psychos are stalking and brutally murdering couples."As Eddie Izzard once observed about B-movie characters, "Don't they listen to the music?". Don't they wonder why it's called the Forest of Death and Blood? Pretty much all the character have had their common sense glands removed, and do something incredibly stupid in almost every scene. Even after the 'reserved screenwriter hero' stops to pick up psycho hitchhikers - a "wow, my IQ just dropped" moment - then everyone is armed to the teeth with knives, axes and stabby things - and nobody thinks this is very weird. Or alarming. Like I would.The most irritating flaw in the film is the post-modern self-aware screenplay discussion that goes on, Tarantino-esque, but in a way that the average audience member doesn't care about or understand. If music had verses explaining the structure, it would be strange enough, but for a film to talk about its own Act 2 twist, Act 3 reversal and bad guy cliches is grating and unnecessary. That said, it does signal the supposedly "big twist" that happens at the beginning of Act 3. The big twist is about as improbable as you can imagine and leaves a whole pile of threads undone. The final 30 minutes must have seen the arrival of LSD in the editing booth, since the style moves from scene-cut-scene-cut to cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-cut. There are some pretty gory moments in between, and plenty of random one-page characters who get clean shots to the head (an accuracy that is mysteriously lost when the bad guy tries to shoot our heroes).Anyway, all-in-all it's a very good B-movie but shows the chasm between B and A that still exists. Even though I went to Hawaii on my honeymoon, I'm now recommending against it based upon the crazed killers that stalk the islands and the incompetent police who shoot people from helicopters. It was missing two vital B-movie ingredients, however - dumb-but-attractive teenagers trying to make out and find somewhere to do the bad thing, and then the subsequent gruesome deaths of said teenagers who are always punished in the Puritanical rules of B-movie slasher folklore.
