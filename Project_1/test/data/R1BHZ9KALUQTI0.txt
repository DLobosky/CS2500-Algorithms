I love this version of Carmen. Anna Caterina Antonacci is in outstanding voice. Her Carmen is fiery, secuctive and sultry. She exudes intensity, but I was afraid that she would fall out of her gypsy dress! Jonas Kauffman has an incredible voice. I also like the MetOpera version with Elina Garanca and Roberto Alagna. Both are great gems for your collection!
