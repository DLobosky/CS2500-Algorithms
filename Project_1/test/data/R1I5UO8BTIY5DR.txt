Decided to upgrade my Linksys G router and bought an E4200.  Setup was easy - the interface is mature, well thought out and familiar.  Then problems started.  2.4Ghz stopped boradcasting.  Restarted the router - all ok.  An hour later both 2.4GHz and 5GHz stopped broadcasting (wired connections still fine).  Cycle power on the router - all okay.  Next morning 5GHz not working.  Argh!  Called support (Phillipines-based:  friendly, polite but typical script readers) who told me to cycle power.  When I explained that I had done that and that the problem kept happening, they informed me that "there was no further troubleshooting that could be done".  Wow!  Went to the store and bought another, thinking maybe I just had a bad copy.  Nope.  Set it up and it was equally flaky.  Tried support once more - fought my way to Level 2 (US based and sounded competent but in the end no help) and was more or less told that what I was describing was not happening. WTF? In case you are wondering, I upgraded the firmware to the latest greatest each time as step 1.  Level 2 support suggested that maybe it was the adapters at fault . . .  Yup, two WET610N adapters, two smart phones, two thinkpads (on with b,g and one with b,g,n), one wireless HP printer and a destop with a g adapter all failed simultaneously!!!  Not bloodly likely.Both E4200's went back and I bought the ASUS RT-N56U from Amazon.  Looks slick, although that is somewhat diminished once it is wired up and all the cables are sprouting from the side.  The interface seems a little less polished than Linksys's - more awkward use of English and some features and settings that I had to hunt for.  To be fair, it is probably more a case of being really familiar with the Linksys user interface.  Now that I've played with this one for a bit I think that I might like it better.Most importantly - I set it up in &lt;1 hour (including upgrading the firmware) and it worked and has continued to work for 5 days now without a hiccough.  If it becomes flaky I will update this review and deduct a star, so if you do not see an edit to this review it means that it is still going strong!
