And each one is completely different. I am enamored of Rilling's cycle because of the complete dedication he and his performers give to each work the perform. The only people who will not like Rilling are those who insist on period intruments( I have tried Gardiner and one Koopman but find Rilling the best)I love the booklets that explan each canata and what to look for in them in order to best appreciate Bach's mastery of finding the best way to express the words. Since the BWV numbers are not sequential this disc contains works from different parts of Bach's life. BWV 30 Joyful Be O Rasomed Throng even though it incorporates music from one of Bach's secular cantatas is no less a masterpiece. Set for the celebration of john the baptist this is the most joyful cantata I have heard yet from the opening chorus to  an aria for soprano using only cello, violin and  with dance forms appearing throughout. Powerfully doneBWV 31 The heaven's Laugh is a cantata for Easter Sunday and is a joyful as 30 but in a completely different way. It's words concern heavenly joy and the music is completely diffent and includes a beautiful sinfonia.Please buy as many Rilling cantatas as you can afford. Please excuse typos i have a neuroloic disease.
