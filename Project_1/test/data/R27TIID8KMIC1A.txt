The Hedgehog is another winner toy for our Lhasa pup.  The large is a bit much for her but she is up to the challenge and will have fun making it squeak and grunt.  Our pup does not intentionally destroy her toys but does eventually wear them out from playing with them everyday.  The Hegehog was included with several other dog toys and the whole lot was packaged very well and arrived within two days after I placed the order.Update:  Callie loves the Hedgehog and can make both squeakers work over and over.  She also loves shaking it and thus one of the legs near the body has a tiny rip in it.  After she was in bed, I quickly mended the tiny rip and our Lhasa is having a ball with one of her favorite new toys.
