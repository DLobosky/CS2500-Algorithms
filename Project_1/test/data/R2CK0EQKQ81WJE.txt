I should have bought 2, especially since the toner costs more than the printer did.  The 2040 has been a solid little work horse and has bee extremely reliable for several years.  I print thousands of pages a month and I have never had any major issues with this printer.  Toner can be expensive for any printer and one is wise to do their homework to see if there are any "tricks" to get more performance out of any given machine.  I just purchased the newer Brother HL-2140 as it is a little faster, a little quieter, and let's face it, after a number of years one starts to worry that their printer might die on them on the least opportune occasion!  Don't worry, my trusty 2040 has been carefully boxed and "archived" so that if I need a back-up to the 2140 or need a second laser printer for any reason I can call it back into service.
