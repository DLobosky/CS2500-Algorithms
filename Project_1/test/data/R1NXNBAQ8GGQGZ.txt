I was really nervous about where this series was going after reading Deity. Not about the writing, because let's face it, that is pretty phenomenal, but mainly, I didn't want Alex turning evil. I didn't want her to want Seth. It is no secret that I have been team Aiden through the whole series and to have it end like it did at the end of Deity, well, that just left me anxious and concerned (by the way I strongly urge you to read Elixir before starting this one, it is fantastic and gives you a great idea of what happened between Alex and Aiden after Deity).And I had a right to be. If I had to hear (okay, read) Alex say "My Seth" one more time, every time, she thought of or mentioned Seth, I seriously thought I would be sick. It was just...ick! In fact, for the first time ever while reading this series, I wanted to scan ahead to see how much of the "My Seth" torture I was going to have to endure. Without giving too much away, it wasn't bad. Worse than I wanted it to be, but not as bad as I feared.And once again, let me repeat, just when I don't think I could love Aiden more than I already do, I do and I can. He (unbelievably) just keeps getting better and better. There were so many great moments between him and Alex, moments that I have been waiting three books (and two novellas) for. They really did make my heart melt. I so want these two to have a happily ever after, I really do. I have been rooting for them since the beginning.Actually there were a lot of characters in this one I didn't think I would ever find myself loving (like Marcus!) and found that I really did after reading this. Apollo being one of them. I love him! I couldn't help it. He was pretty fun and an all around great guy, if not mysterious. Deacon and Luke were just as great as was Solo. Olivia, Lea, really everyone has grown so much that it is hard not to care for them all.I will admit that we do get to see sides of Seth that I wasn't expecting. Sides that do make me think he cares about Alex, maybe just not in the way that is right for either of them, but in the only way that he knows how to.Once again Jennifer created a kick butt addition to this series. Alex is a strong and fierce as she ever has been. She continues to grow through this series and with each new book I love her more.This was a hard book to read, not only because it means there is only one more left until the whole series is over and we will have to say good bye but because we loose some people in this one. People I have grown to care about over the course of the series. It does make me nervous for what will happen in the last book. I don't want to have to say good bye to any more people that I love and I know that I will.I love how this one ended. It was a beautiful way to end it after what had just happened the chapter before. It makes me worry for Alex though. She has so much weighing on her. So much she is responsible for but I know if anyone can do it, she can and will.This was very well done and I can't wait to get my hands on the next and last volume however bittersweet that will be.
