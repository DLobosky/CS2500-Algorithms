Actually, I do grasp it...she is too rock for country, too country for rock, thus fitting both, and neither.The album at hand is a "greatest hits" compilation of her early work. It is NOT the same as the domestic version with the same title, but different picture. There are songs on each that are not on the other, though I admit there are a lot of repeats. I need not go into specifics...fans already know them...except to say that "Is Heaven Good Enough For You?" [sung with her sister Shelby], is haunting.This [along with the other of the same title] is an essential album. The girl has an absolutely fabulous voice that is never less than superbly used. Even granting my vicarious crush, ten stars would be too few.
