Pyrex has a long history of producing superior Cookware, actually since 1919 originally called "Fire Glass" because it could withstand Heat, I always wash them by hand and do not expose it to rapid temperature changes, I would never take the Baking Dish from the Refrigerator to the Oven, or from a Hot Oven to Cold running water, I'm always carefull because after all ...it is Glass! The Best Glass ...Pyrex!  Check Pictures Posted, Thank You
