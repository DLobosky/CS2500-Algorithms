Wish they wouldn't have waited until later additions to include exercises though. Funny that this innovation was not considered until the later edition of the book, because I would've thought it would've been in the first or second. Basic human logic would dictate that if your offering lessons in clarity and grace, one doesn't just spit out the nuts and bolts, but offers the opportunity to practice. That apparently missed the authors of this book for many editions.
