The God's Word Translation is very easy to understand and read. The booklet Promises from God's Word is just packed full of wonderful, inspiring Bible verses in many different categories. Some of them are Hope for Eternal Life, Hope for the Resurrection, Marriage as God Intended, The Mercy of the Son and on.  This  booklet can be carried anywhere and everywhere. It is very handy and offer a wealth of information that can be read over and over. This  booklet has a very colorful cover and the handy size makes it a great booklet for yourself or as a gift. It would be a gift that is very much appreciated. I would recommend it very much.  Given to me from BakerBooks for review purposes.
