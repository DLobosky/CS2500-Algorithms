The atmosphere, the acting by the great William Powell and his cast including Mary Astor,Ralph Morgan. Powell has a great screen presence as a detective. How he solves the murder and how he was killed was pure genius as far as the story unfolds. A GREAT FILM. A true gem.  Offered from Alpha DVD and the Roan Group. The Roan Group print is 100% better as Alpha just cranks them on DVD while Roan Group remasters their prints.. The Roan Group has a Nancy Drew Mystery as a 2nd feature and its really bad,goofy , unfunny and nothing compared to Kennel Murder,which is why I bought the Roan Group's DVD. 5 stars for the Kennel Murder Case. Now there is one from Marengo films which has British Intelligence which is better than Nancy Drew and the print is as good as The Roan Group - something to look into...
