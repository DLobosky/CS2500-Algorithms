I replied "Well, we loved the first two installments. With Jean Grey returing as The Phoenix, it should be great!"We watched it last night and were stunned. We were both silent--in shock--at the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT: Phoenix--resurrected Jean Grey--ends up killing Cyclops during a romantic tryst. You see, we weren't told something important in the first two installments: Xavier had to "split" Jean into two personalities to protect her from her own gifts. The purely instinctual, uncontrolled, subconscious part of her was "The Phoenix". The conscious, controlled, intellectual part was the Jean we knew from the first two movies.If that isn't bad, she ends up disintegrating Xavier. Yes, the beloved Doctor and leader of the School for Gifted Youngsters goes out with a whimper.Magneto takes this uncontrollable creature under his wings (?!). She mostly stands by looking blank (I think she was supposed to look menacing) until the final confrontation. After some of the mutants are neutralized with "the cure" (a serum derived from a mutant that reverses mutations) or destroyed--THEN Phoenix suddenly goes into action, disintegrating people and objects.Wolverine says he's the only one that can stop her, because of his regenerative skills. Jean comes to her senses for a few seconds, and begs Wolverine to save her. Of course, he has to kill her to do so.Storm--a lackluster Hallie Barry--ends up taking over the school and delivering a ho-hum eulogy. There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start. I'll just mention a few:1. Brett Ratner stinks as a director2. Special effects, no matter how cool, are never a substitute for a strong plot and strong dialogue (unless you're just a mindless consumer of action flicks)3. Magneto, played by Ian McKellan, wears his helmet almost the entire second half of the movie. If you recall, he wore this helmet to stop the thoughts of Xavier from infiltrating and influencing his mind. Why, then, did Magneto continue to wear his helmet after Xavier was annihilated?4. If Xavier was going to die, he deserved a better send off than having his protege having a cosmic tantrum and destroying him5. Why is Logan/Wolverine smiling up at the sky, school campus awash in sunshine and colorful flowers, when he's lost his father figure and had to kill the woman he loves--in effect losing her TWICE?6. Bobby (Ice Boy) begins to get cozy with the Girl Who Can Walk Through Walls. There is little interaction between he and Rogue (poor Anna Paquin hardly gets any air time!)--and Rogue knows Bobby is cozy with the other chick. Yet, she takes the cure to rid her of her mutant powers so she can touch/kiss Bobby? Maybe--but GEEZ. Weren't enough mutants already killed or neutralized?!So we have Mystique neutralized (she's a mere human), as is Magneto and Rogue. Xavier is dead, as is Jean Grey and Cyclops. Storm is in charge of the school, Wolverine is hunky dory with the way everything has turned out, and the mutants and humans are now united--living happily ever after.For crying out loud!!The only good thing about this movie was the special effects and some cool mutants like "Tin Man" (can't remember his real name), the blue fur guy, Juggernaut (very cool!), Angel Boy (also cool) and a kid who sprouts spikes.However, that's not enough to save this movie. We were so disgusted that I'm going to list this movie on Amazon for sale right after I write this review. (We didn't even want to explore the extras or alternative endings!)What a waste of EXCELLENT acting talent. (That is, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin.)Whoever agreed to hand this debacle over to Brett Ratner should be excommunicated from Hollywood--as should Ratner himself and whoever wrote this lacklaster script. What a way to sink an incredible, exciting movie franchise!
