Was. It. This bag is beautifully designed--well padded, so many pockets, and an interior that well suits a digital camera of any size--but with removeable inserts (although sturdy--they come out completely) and perfect interior space for my Canon HX-A1s camcorder. Walking around with it is a breeze now (as these things go). And all the pockets and zippers are great--very well designed if you want to use the "full backpack" features (I just carry it over my shoulder and it hangs nicely in back, out of the way). The full length double-side zippers are great and it opens easily from the top if you just want to pull it in and out without fully unzipping it each time.There's plenty of room for the shotgun mike, etc. and two well secured straps on top for the tripod. Everything is well made and well thought out (and I like the dark red-almost purple/red color with the black. It is definitely not pink, as some of the photos seem).Great bag in every way!
