The cabinet has a face frame but the drawers are floating and there is no horizontal rail that defines the separation between openings. I didn't expect this to be an issue, but it rendered these tools ineffective.I didn't understand this difference until I tried to mount my full extension drawer slides and I was having trouble clamping the tool down on the vertical stile of my face frame. Because these share the same mounting configuration, they don't clamp to the stile either. I couldn't find a spot to get any leverage on it or use C-clamps to hold it in place. I ended up cutting stop blocks (story sticks) to do the mounting. Afterward I went back to have another look at the tool instructions and only then did I notice that all illustrations showed the tool clamped to a horizontal rail. That's a subtle difference that belies the advertisement that these and the other tool are perfect for mounting drawers and drawer slides. Perhaps if I was building a more conventional kitchen cabinet (or a few of them) this would be worth it, but I was pretty annoyed. I bought this and the other drawer mounting tool from Kreg. Since Kreg's pocket hole jig got me into furniture building, I expected more from these and the other tool which cost about $45 together. A tool like this could certainly be a bit more universal and would only require minor modifications to allow it to be used on stile or rail - why don't they do that?
