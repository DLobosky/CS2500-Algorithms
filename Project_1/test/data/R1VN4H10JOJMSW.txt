Malibran was opera's first girl superstar, but her personal life kept getting in the way until her tragic death at 28. Her legend is sort of like "What if Amy Winehouse could actually sing"? A book I had some years ago of juicy tales about great singers gave her a large chapter.....As to the issue at hand.........Cecilia Bartoli has given us an album of works written for the great contralto. Now, if the music is an unknown quantity, Cecilia sure isn't. The great Mezzo of our day has long specialized in the unusual, and this recording brings out all of her massive talent. You won't know the numbers [at least I didn't], except for "casta diva", from Norma. Do you care? That's the question.This is a beautifully produced album [the book alone is worth the price], that at 79'47" gives full value. Gorgeous girl, great music, well sung. Perhaps it's for the fan of the rare and unusual; if that's you, go for it.
