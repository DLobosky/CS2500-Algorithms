This is, in part, because of the repertoire in which he specialized during his long career -- Czech music including Dvorak, Suk and Mahler, whose symphonies he recorded on at least two occasions with, first, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and, later, with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. As longtime music director of the Czech Phil -- where he stayed until his 1990 retirement -- most make their acquaintance with Neumann through that partnership.And here is an examplary representation of that collaboration, a wonderful stereo recording of one of Dvoark's greatest symphonies, the alternately happy and powerful Symphony No. 6. I've  owned a lot of recordings of this music by alleged Dvorak specialists before I happily committed myself to this one. Why? Mostly because of the way Neumann gets the orchestra to alternately press and elongate phrases and emotions.For an instantaneous example, check out the final five minutes of the second movement, Adagio. While he doesn't make time stand still a la Bruckner, the phrasing and expressiveness of the orchestra takes your breath away, right up to that final phrase first in the flute and later in the horn and strings. The contrast in the following furiant is delicious and marvelously pursued by the forces, right up to the closing pages.In my experience, Neumann is a literal conductor, looking over scores for important points of focus, emphasis and spotlight. In Dvorak, however, he is a different man. Here is a conductor completley enmeshed in the Czech emotions inherent in Dvoark's dance rhythms. He'll build a phrase from pp to p to m to f and back down the scale in less than a couple bars where it adds important affect to the musical message. An additional point in his favor -- Neumann never fails to elicit that famous old world wail from the Czech's horns and woodwinds to wonderful effect even though such playing was considered impossibly old fashioned by the time this recording was made in 1982.The 6th Symphony is a happy, tuneful ride -- the tunesmith Dvorak at his most effective and representative. It lacks the Brahmsian drama of the 7th Symphony and is completely in league with the fabulous Symphony No. 8. If you are looking for such an experience, or if you are looking to add to your Dvoark collection, this will be an outstanding addition for you.
