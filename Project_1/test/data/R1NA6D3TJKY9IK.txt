Getting a core workout was a bonus!I really like the stretch part of this DVD -- her explanations are good and the camera work shows what to do.  I like the core routine, too -- but I'll be honest that there are some of the exercises that I just can't do.  I guess I was more out of shape than I thought.  For now, I just skip those parts and concentrate on the ones I can do.  A nice thing about this workout is that you don't need any equipment -- just an old towel and a carpeted floor, rug or a mat.I bought four DVDs at about the same time, and do different routines on different days, typically some each of the stretching, core/Pilates and knees about 5 days a week.  It's been a month, and there is a difference in how I feel . . . and my husband says also in how I look and move.  I'd recommend any or all of the four I got -- they each have a little different workout:Pilates for BeginnersAM/PM Stretch for HealthJeanette Jenkins: Hollywood Trainer 21 Day Core and Stretch WorkoutStrong Knees
