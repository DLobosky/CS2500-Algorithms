According to the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, before the end of this century we may live in a world of elevated temperatures, rising sea level, and extreme weather. However, as dire as the predictions are, the reality is much worse.  The climate models are indeed inaccurate ... in their timing.  Climate change has accelerated beyond the predictions of only one or two years ago. In his movie, An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore states that the Arctic will be ice free in the summer in 40 years. That would put it about 2046. However, there have been news reports at the end of 2007 that NASA climate scientists are now predicting the summer of 2012 as the date for an ice-free Arctic. The ice in question is floating sea ice. Its melting will not raise the level of the world's oceans. However, an ice free Arctic Ocean will absorb more sunlight, increasing the Arctic warming trend. This film documents the actions of those who are bringing the message of the reality of climate change to the public, and also those in our government and in private industry who would have us believe that there is a genuine debate about the reality of climate change. In fact, the "debate" has been artificially created by the fossil fuel industry.  All you have to do to be convinced that we are in trouble is to look at the satellite view of the Arctic Ocean for September 2007. (See customer image) Forty percent of the area that had been covered by ice is now open ocean. Although the majority of people in the US are convinced that we have to do something about climate change, there is still well financed opposition.  I recently received a petition in the US mail. It included a 12 page color so-called scientific paper that claimed to prove that more CO2 was a good idea. Many people at universities have gotten this mailer. It costs a lot to send these out. I did a Google search. The authors of the paper are associated with the Marshall Foundation, whose president is from the Petroleum Institute. Marshall has received funding from the oil industry. On the positive side, we do have the opportunity for green industries, to develop alternate sources of energy, to increase the efficiency of our energy use. Grass roots groups to fight climate change have grown up all over the US. The Weather Channel has expanded its coverage of climate change by expanding Forecast Earth to one hour. However, Heidi Cullen, who was one of the people featured in Everything's Cool, is no longer the host of the show. She now appears occasionally in her role as a climatologist.  This is a must-see movie. I also recommend the books: "With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change",about recent scientific investigations and their implications for global warming, and Global Warning: The Last Chance for Change, which details the world politics of climate change. PS. In November 2008, the Weather Channel, now owned by GE, cancelled Forecast Earth.
