I like that the faces can be used to talk about emotions with a child.  I also like that all of the pieces fit in the small box (with some careful arranging).The toy is limited in that there is only space to make one bear at a time.  It also comes with a decent amount of small pieces (which can be easily scattered/lost).We got the Melissa and Doug Wooden Bear Family for my daughter's birthday and I like that set a little more because there are more bears to make.  I would recommend checking out the bear family if you are interested in this bear because for a few more dollars, you get three bears to dress which provides a lot more possibilities (and a lot more pieces).
