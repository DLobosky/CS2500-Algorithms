Oh, I just loved this book! It was totally sappy, predictable and more than a little clich&eacute;d, but it held no small amount of charm, making it a really fun read. Everyone needs a silly romance every now and then to brighten up their mood! I remember when I first read the book's premise, I was excited to read it and I am glad that I was able to find it and read it. I have read several of Hannah's other books and I think this is one her stronger works. The whole movie-star-priest-love-triangle was just great... and really, so what if it was more than little like a soap opera, I just loved reading it!
