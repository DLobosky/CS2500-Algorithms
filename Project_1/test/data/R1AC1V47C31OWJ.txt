A notional British security service is populated with a large extended cast of characters surrounding one overall protagonist, David Audley, a brilliant ex rugger player and scholar who specializes in untangling elaborate Soviet (and other) espionage schemes. Yet each book is told from the point of view of a different character.This one, in the middle of the series, is told from the point of view of a field researcher (operative - the notional department is call R and D) named Frances Fitzgibbon, widow of a British soldier killed in Ireland. It is a tense time for R and D as the old chief, Clinton, is being replaced but the replacement has not been decided and one of the candidates, tasked with uncovering an Irish terror plot, has unsettling questions raised about his past. In this plot and characterization, Price hits the high point of his series. If you are to read just one of these fine books, read this one. I found myself to be emotionally moved  and reflective at the end which ends up not a suprise at all.
