Treacherous Beauties is my favorite of the Harlequin 12 that are out and it is included in this set of 3. All three movies are mystery romances with good endings. Great watch on a cold rainy or snowy day. Buying them in the set is a really good buy. I would recommend all 4 volumes to complete the set of 12 that is out. All the movies have been shown on the Hallmark Channel.
