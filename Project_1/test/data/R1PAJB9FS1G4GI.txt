As for the quality of the movies they are as good as they get. The age of the movies really has not made it too difficult for their transition to Blu Ray.Paramount has a web site dedicated to Blu Rays. This is where you would register for BD LIVE in order to have access through your Blu Ray player for the added features. After doing some investigating into this site it states that Paramount BD LIVE is only available to US RESIDENTS. Needless to say I contacted my Blu Ray manufacturer they told me to insert an SD CARD into my player. After following my manufactures instructions BD LIVE is working now...!So for those who have bought Paramount movies,and a warning comes up that you have no internet connection is it's because the SD card is required. BD LIVE will work only after you insert an SD CARD, and is available to us Canadians...!
