I needed a compact, but ergonomically excellent cordless mouse for my tiny HP netbook PC, and the Logitech V220 more than fits the bill.  It's truly 'plug and play' with my Windows XP system, and this mouse will work with the default settings, even without downloading the mouse software from Logitech's website.  Downloading the software (which only takes 2 minutes - no serial numbers or other lengthy codes to type in - THANK YOU Logitech!) is advisable though, because you can choose and control the operational parameters and personal settings of this mouse to your liking. The mouse works just like a corded one, and feels solid, precise, and well made.  In addition, the USB plug in receiver neatly tucks away into the bottom of the mouse when not in use (it slides in), and turns the mouse off automatically!  This is pure genius!  Kudos to Logitech for offering such an affordable and well built and functioning compact cordless mouse!  Buy with confidence.
