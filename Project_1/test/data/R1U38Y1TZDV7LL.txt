I am half-way through reading it, and these veterans have plenty to say about John Kerry.  Veterans normally don't criticize other veterans, so that is reason enough to pay attention to this book.  These guys are veterans!
 
 John O'Neill, co-author of this book is a Democrat who voted for Al Gore in 2000, and said he was ready to support John Edwards if he got the nomination.  When Kerry became the front-runner, everything changed.  He and his fellow veterans wanted this country to know and be reminded what kind of person John Kerry really is.
 
 John O'Neill debated Kerry in 1971 on Dick Cavett.  I watched it on CSPAN a few weeks ago. No one can accuse O'Neill of being a lying Republican.  O'Neill's animosity for Kerry goes back to at least 1971 when he heard Kerry publicly accuse Vietnam soldiers of atrocities before the US Senate in 1971.  Due in part to Kerry's blanket indictment of his fellow "brothers," Vietnam veterans were shunned, called baby-killers, and were even spit upon after they came home.  His words and the words of others were used against our POWS.
 
 From reading other reviews I gather that Fox News did a story on Amazon lifting their normal policies on reviews and letting this be a "free-for-all."  I remember leaving a one-star review for Michael Moore's movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" and a couple days later it was removed.  I wrote another review that was finally left there (I think).  If Amazon is going to consider this book a free-for-all during this election season, they should do it with all political books and movies.
