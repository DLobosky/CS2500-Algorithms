It has spectacular battle sequences, wonderful characters and great discussions of a variety of topics. Its one of the greatest achievements in film I've run across. Its a wonderful trip into another time and place.This film is getting two versions released on DVD and to me, if you're going to see this film I recommend that you see this full version. You have to keep in mind that the way this was originally released was as two separate films running approximately 150 minutes each. It was really designed to be a story spread out across a huge canvas. If you want to see this film, this is the way to go.I'm not going to go into the merits off the film itself, that's best left for you to discover,  I just want to point out a couple of things about this version of the film and its differences between it and the theatrical version.First when you watch this version be patient. The film is almost five hours long and it uses all of that time to build characters. I remember when I saw the first half I was shocked at how many characters didn't seem to have a reason for being. Then I saw the second half and found that they got their time in the spotlight there.Be ready for the film to pause to build characters and to set up the philosophy and reasons behind what is happening. This is more than just armies crashing together. Its a whole world not a battlefield. There are times when the action stops for a while while people talk and make plans.If you are considering whether to get this or the shorter version understand that this full version is essentially cut in half by the "theatrical" version. The first half of the film is cut down to around an hour and the second half gets cut down to around eighty minutes. The resulting film loses not only many characters, much character development, numerous subplots (including how some characters really end up making shots at the end mean nothing), but also a good deal of the action. Most notably the opening and closing battle sequences are cut down in the short version. I've spoken with a couple of people who prefer the short version because it gets right to the good stuff, but at the same time they aren't in love with the trims to the action.For me there is no question, the only way to see this film is to see this longer "international" version. Yes it has more talk, but to me that builds character and makes you care about the people and the situations more, it also has more action. Certainly a few bits get talky but since this is a DVD one can zip ahead a little bit (yes I know its sacrilege, but at the same time if you're concerned about too much talk better to do that and see the full film rather than be missing half the film.) This is a spectacular film  and if you are going to see it you must make an effort to see it in its full glory.
