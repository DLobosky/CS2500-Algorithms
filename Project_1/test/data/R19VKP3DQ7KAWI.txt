My law office in on the second floor of a building built over 100 years ago, long before modern fire codes. I wanted this fire escape ladder as there is only 1 exit and I was concerned that in case of fire that 1 exit might be blocked. This ladder addresses my concerns and is reasonably priced and has decent quality. However, like other reviewers, I am disappointed it is designed for 1 time use only, as this prevents us from actually testing it. Since I bought this ladder with knowledge from other reviews that it was 1 time use only, I cannot really complain. However, I did deduct 1 star. 4 stars from me.
