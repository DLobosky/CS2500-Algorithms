I found this collection of stories somewhat surprising in its depiction of the vibrant Romanian culture that apparently thrived behind its cold war Stalinist facade.  Although some stories seemed to have been taken straight from folklore (the phantom church that a 18th century rebel had converted into a ship complete with sails), others reveal only its subtle influences (as in where a teenage girl imagines herself as a sort of frog princess), while many of the stories correspond to more prosaic events, such as a father and son's discovery of a motorcycle left behind by a World War II German tenant.
