So imagine my surprise/glee when I started Frostbite and I realized that they really do just keep on getting better.Frostbite really gripped me from the first few pages. I loved the new characters that were introduced in this book, like Aiden and Christian's aunt, and I loved getting more of Mason and Christian. There's so many characters in this series and I can totally understand why it'd be difficult to make them all seem real, but Richelle Mead didn't let it stop her. She clearly didn't want any of her characters to be flat.I also enjoyed reading the characters outside of St. Vladimir's. As much as I love boarding schools, I really liked being able to see even more of the awesome world Richelle Mead built. Even if it was just a ski lodge and a town a little outside of it, it was still cool to see how the moroi/strigoi/dhampirs functioned outside of St. Vladimir's.And jeez, the main storyline was totally epic. The climax blew me away and I definitely cried. A lot. I won't get into any spoilers, but I just felt so bad for Rose and all she's been through, and she's just so brave and strong and awesome. Seriously - Rose is an amazing protagonist. She definitely has her flaws, but that's what makes her so real.The further delving into the bond between Rose and Lissa, as well more explanation to why it existed was really neat. Richelle Mead really thought about what she wanted the bond to achieve and why it existed, and that was evident.I also loved getting more of a backstory on Rose herself. Her mother played a role in this book and it was interesting to actually read her first hand, rather than reading Rose's vague reminiscences of what childhood she had.And, ooh, Dimitri! I mean, I don't really have anything else to say about that, but I love all the bickering between him and Rose. It was cute. It was also very natural feeling. While I liked Aiden in this book (sort of), I wasn't really all that into him. He's way too cocky, but I'd have to see how he is in future books to really make up my mind.Overall, Frostbite was fantastic. It exceeded the first in awesomeness. When I finished it, I knew I had to run out to the store and buy Shadow Kiss right away.
