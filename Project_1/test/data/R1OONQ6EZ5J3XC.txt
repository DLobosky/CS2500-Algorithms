I've always wanted a cordless mouse in my 20 years or so of computing, and never took the plunge until now.  My first thought after using it was "how have I lived without one for so long?"  The LX8 Cordless Laser mouse works as good as, if not better than my corded mice i've used in the past.  Operation is flawless, just like a corded mouse.  Mouse ergonomics and overall feel in hand are fantastic.  The software is easy to download off of Logitech's website (took only 2 minutes), and I appreciate being able to just download it without having to inconveniently and tediously type in any serial numbers or other codes.  Even if you don't download the software, this cordless mouse is 'plug and play' on my Windows Vista system.  Of course, downloading the software allows you to change the control parameters and speed of the mouse cursor, etc.  I'm a stickler for high quality, and my hat goes off to Logitech for offering a very affordable and well functioning cordless/wireless mouse.  Buy with confidence!
