I have been using my Paperwhite all month without a case because I wanted to get used to reading on a bare device and see if I really needed a case.  I have had cases for all my previous Kindles and found them a necessity for holding clip on lights securely.Since the paperwhite has a built in light, I thought I could just skip it.  I did try a case from my Kindle Touch but it was too loose on the Paperwhite.  Toward the middle of the month, I realized that I really like the security of a case.  Not only am I afraid of dropping the unprotected case but I am also afraid of dropping something onto the bare screen when it is sitting on a table or nightstand :(  I figured that if I did get a case, I would really like one that turned the Kindle on and off upon opening or closing.  However, I did not want to pay a lot for it, especially in relation to the cost of the Paperwhite.I have a MoKo cover case for my Nexus 7 with the auto on/off closing and I do like the quality of the case.  So, when I saw this case advertised, it was an easy choice for me.  The only thing that gave me pause was in the product description, the first date available was listed as March, 2012.  Since the Paperwhite was not even shipped until the end of September 2012, I was concerned that this was really designed for the Kindle Touch.I received the case yesterday and was absolutely delighted to find that it is perfectly designed for the Paperwhite.  I got it in black and the product pictures depict it accurately.  The leather is very smooth and the stitching is as well done as it is with my Nexus case.  The inside is very soft and the magnets not only turn the Paperwhite on and off (one still has to swipe the screen to unlock) but they hold the case closed.I can easily recommend this MoKo case and know that MoKo will be one of my top choices for all future device covers.
