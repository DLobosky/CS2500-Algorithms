It is clearly written and presents earthquakes from the unique perspective of the Pacific Northwest.There is an alternative introductory book by the late Bruce Bolt on earthquakes in general, and another with emphasis on California by Sue Hough.  Each has its strengths - the Hough book is particularly well-written, the Bolt book has good pictures and illustrations and a dry wit although it is growing out of date, and this one builds upon the findings of the leading scholars of the Oregon-Washington region to show the big picture of science and government's role in hazard management.With a good index, list of regional earthquakes, and glossary, an attentive reader will gain an in-depth knowledge of some geophysics and its serious hazards for Cascadia.Although I haven't compared them word by word, the 2nd editions seems a major improvement in readability.  Yeats actually cites the experience of co-teaching with a colleague of mine the very class I now teach as inspiration for the improvements.
