Anyway, I have declared the following 9 episodes to now be the official complete set in the chronicle series and regardless of what anyone says, it cannot and will not be changed. Ever.  Or until George Lucas gets back on his medicine and off his high horse, and realizes he has failed in presenting the complete 9 episodes he promised years ago, and makes amends by giving us the last trilogy we deserve. We need closure and so here it is:1. The Phantom Menace (1999) - Episode One2. Attack Of The Clones (2002) - Episode Two3. Revenge Of The Sith (2005) - Episode Three4. A New Hope (1977) - Episode Four5. The Star Wars Holiday Special (aka Life Day Celebration)   (Nov. 1978) - Episode Five.   (Face it, this tv special featured the same characters from the     series- Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fischer, R2D2, C3PO,    Chewbacca, etc., and it isn't some lame cartoon, and actually has    a plot- therefore, it is part of the continuing storyline.)6. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - Episode Six7. Return Of The Jedi (1983) - Episode Seven8. Ewoks Adventure: Caravan Of Courage (1984) - Episode Eight9. Ewoks Adventure: The Battle For Endor (1985) - Episode Nine   (Both of the Ewoks movies were originally shown on tv, and are     now available as a 2-on-1 dvd.  If they played such a big part    in Return Of The Jedi, then why can't these 2 movies be part of    the continuing story line?  They aren't lame cartoons, they both    have plots, and therefore, must be accepted as episodes 8 and 9.)There really is no point in making Star Wars a tv series (in place of giving us the real last trilogy set) because we already have a Star Trek,Stargate, and Battlestar Gallactica.  So I declare the above list of 9episodes to now be the official set of 9 in the chronicle series and it cannot and will not ever be changed. So take that George Lucas! :P
