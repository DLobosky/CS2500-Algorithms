And I still was there on the first day for the first showing. And this time around I was not disappointed. This was more like the Star Wars that I remembered when I was a kid...almost.Yes this film did have its flaws. Again the dialogue was a little corny and I could have done without most of the romantic scenes between Padme and Anakin. Especially the two of them rolling around in the fields spouting bad dialogue. But no one said this was supposed to be Oscar caliber dialogue either. But in the end all of that I can tolerate since in this film we are treated to a lot less of the annoying Jar Jar Binks. He delivers a few lines throughout the film and then we are able to forget about him and concentrate on the rest of the film.Because this is the beginning of the Clone Wars we are treated to the biggest lightsaber battles ever captured on screen. My man Mace Windu finally gets a chance to step up and shows us what he is made of. And of course we get to finally see Yoda put down his can and fight with a lightsaber and it is a spectacular battle that has to be seen to be believed. Also with this film we are introduced to the newest villain Count Dooku played by the legendary Christopher Lee. I was really surprised that he did this role but after seeing him in it I am glad he chose to do it.Yet again Lucas gives us a great 2 DVD set packed with extras. I especially love all of the various trailers included on the bonus disc and the various documentaries give us some insight (if that is humanly possible) into what Lucas was thinking as he was making the film. Also we get some deleted scenes some of which you may wonder why they were not included in the film to begin with. The film looks great and the sound is incredible. You almost feel like you are in the middle of the battles as they are happening.Overall Attack of the Clones is a very good addition to the Star Wars films. It does have it slow parts and some of the romantic scenes tend to run on a lot longer then they should but in the end the final half hour makes up for it. While not as good as the three films in the original trilogy it does succeed in being much better than The Phantom Menace and succeeds in being fun and entertaining. This DVD is a must have for any Star Wars fan and a great addition to any DVD library.
