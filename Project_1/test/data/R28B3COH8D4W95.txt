The plot of this one is also pretty well-developed and very nice for an early reader -- there's a lot more there for a little kid to enjoy than I've found typical at this level.However, the "fancy words" in the Fancy Nancy concept makes it a little odd to use as an early reader.  At level 1, they should be reading with a parent anyway, but the fancy words would be really hard to decode, even for kids reading a Level 3 or 4 of a series like this.  I like that they put a little glossary of the fancy words and their definitions in the back -- in this book they are alfresco, brilliant, constellation, fascinating, meteor, orbit and planetarium. They bring in what seems to be a recurring Fancy Nancy theme of making the best of a less-than-perfect situation, and turning a disappointment into a nice moment with her family when the trip to the planetarium goes awry.  Overall, I like this book, and think it's a great early reader, as long as parents are ok with sitting down and helping with the "fancy words."
