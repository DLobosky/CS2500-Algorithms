These are the guys who find fabulous archival TV footage from European TV stations, who - unlike the US networks - preserve their archives - and have produced such great series as The American Folk Blues Festival, the Motown series with The Miracles and Marvin Gaye, the Pete Seeger Live in Australia (the first of their Folk Icons series and, the real gem, The four box sets in the Jazz Icons series. This box set of four DVDs (including the "Bonus Disc") carries on the tradition but goes one step further. The Icons series consisted of just performances. For three of this British Invasion discs, there is a story to be told and Peck has "Directed" these so that interviews with the artists (and a few "friends") are woven into a story. There is no Narrator; the interviews tie everything together. The documentaries contain full songs but then you have the option of watching just the performances with two to four ADDITIONAL performances. There's almost two hours of material on each of the three "individual" DVDs and over 2 ½ hours (60 minutes of performances and 90 minutes of interviews) on the "Bonus Disc. So, in this reviewer's opinion, there is no reason to buy the individual DVDs. You need the box set with the Bonus Disc! Not only that, but each of the interviews on the Bonus Disc - which excerpted in some cases on the other volumes, takes the career of each of the artists interviewed, from the first time they picked up an instrument to the peak of their popularity and you'll find all of them great conversationalists as well. The only exception is Burt Bacharach, who comments on Dusty Springfield, and seems, not only egotistical, but not very interested in talking. Contrast this with Peter Noone (Herman's Hermits), who is so delightful and engaging (and self-deprecating) that you'll want to hear another hour from him. Gerry Marsden (Gerry and the Pacemakers) still lives in Mersey and you'll have a new respect for his career after watching the performances and hearing his talk. Both these groups grew up in Liverpool and played The Cavern at same time as the Beatles. (Marsden recounts a "supergroup" concert he and his band members did with the Beatles that will have you wishing that it was recorded - and that Peck and Galloway found the tapes and issued them!). Each disc has new interviews (done by Rob Bowman who really brings out their personality) except for the late Dusty Springfield. There are some excellent archival interviews with her. You'll learn why the Springfields broke up, where she got her first name from and much more. The only group I haven't mentioned so far is Small Faces. They are the oddball group in a set titled "British Invasion" because they never performed in the US at the time of these performances and only had one US hit single ("Itchy Koo Park"). But they were important in the British music scene and formed the basis of the later Faces (with Rod Stewart).The performance are sometimes lip-synched but most were done "live" and the clips from the New Music Express Awards Annual Concert are probably being seen for the first time and show one of the first performances by Herman's Hermit's playing live outside of TV studio dance parties.The word "Quality" is all over this set. The archival footage looks and sounds GREAT! Each disc has a 20-page booklet of detailed notes, track list and great graphics. This is the GOLD STANDARD of music DVDs.I could go on for pages on how fine this compilation is but, if you just look at samples on the Reelin In The Years Website you'll see what I mean and just go out and buy it. And then you'll spend a week watching and listening (and going back to view favorite performances) and then, like me, wonder how Peck, Galloway and Gulotta are going to top this one for their next project!Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
