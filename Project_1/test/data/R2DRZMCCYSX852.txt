In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster. The cast is good. Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas. In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character. Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him extra screen time. The movie does have its faults. Am I the only one who thought the tactics used in the defense of Helm's Deep were absurd?  The whole point of a defensive wall is to give you the chance to kill the enemy before he gets over the parapet.  You don't wait until he climbs over to use your sword on him.  Maybe I know too much about how actual medieval warfare was fought.  As to the extra shots in the DVD, the scene with Denethor in Osgiliath is so good that I simply cannot believe it was left out of the original cut.  On the other hand, with some scenes I tend to agree with the original decision not to use it. The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism. They also have a more serious message. Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside. This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up. Is this really what we want? Is it making us happier? Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.
