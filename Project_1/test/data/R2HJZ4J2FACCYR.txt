MGM's James Bond Collection #2 provides the Bond fan the an assortment of the &quot;middle&quot; Bond movies (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker, along with  the first Bond movie, Dr. No), with an assortment of the extra  accompliments that DVD lovers have come to expect in the the format:  audio  commentary, a documentary &quot;Making of&quot; or &quot;Inside,&quot;  along with original ads and trailers.For action, Dr. No and Her  Majesty's Secret Service are two of the best of the series.  The Spy Who  Loved Me and The Man with the Golden Gun offer two of the most stylish of  the series, with lavish sets and larger than life villians.  This set  would have received five stars had it not included &quot;Moonraker,&quot;  one of the two weak Moore movies (the other being &quot;A View to A  Kill&quot;) and the Bond producers response to &quot;Star Wars;&quot;  however, since &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; had been issued on the  previous set, that was not possible.  At Amazon's price, this set is a  must for Bond, and other action, lovers, and I'd recommend it.
