The fabric cover is somewhat shiny and the texture looks unnatural on my skin, whereas the mepiform matches my slightly tanned caucasian skin's color and texture very well.  The Scar Away pads tend to stretch out where you pull them away from the backing, and the part that you've stretched out doesn't stick as well so it starts peeling off your skin there.  The Scar Away is also harder to apply evenly as it tends to curl up while you're trying to put it in place.The Scar Away pads stick for me about 1/2 to 3/4 day, the Mepiform sticks about 1 day, and the Cica Care pads stick for at least several days.  Then I have to throw them out and start with a new piece.  Cleaning the ScarAway and Mepiform pads doesn't seem to revitalize the stickiness for me.  Other people will probably get much longer stickiness if applied to flat non-stretchy dry skin.The Mepiform pads are better in most all respects, so unless you really need to save money I'd go with them.  The Cica Care pads are better in many respects for out of sight scars, but very expensive.  See my reviews of the Cica Care and Mepiform pads for more info on them. The only reason I would go with Scar Away pads is if you are on a strict budget, or if your scar is hidden so you can use tape to make the pad stick.Having said that, any of these pads are much better than creams.
