In a way I found that irritating, and mostly because I expect more from the one band I buy everything - singles included - from.I'll keep this brief, telling you to listen to the sample and see what you think about it yourself. If you like it - good. If you don't, do not feel like you are alone. This is one of the few times I found Groth and company at fault.
