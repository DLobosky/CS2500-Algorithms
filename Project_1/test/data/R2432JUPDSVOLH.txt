Where ELSE would you get multiple choices of flavored popcornWITHOUT them damned almonds and peanuts.One word about the TASTE...WOW!Oh, forgot, it says on each bag:"NO high-fructose corn syrupNO artificial flavoringNO artificial coloringNO trans-fatsNO glutenNO nuts"My only other comment is about the claim that each bag serves twelve people:"I ain't sharing MY bag with eleven people -- buy your own darn caramel popped corn!
