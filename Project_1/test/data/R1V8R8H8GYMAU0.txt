As an herbalist with 20 years of experience, I have a definite bias towards taking herbs in a manner you can taste, which allows your body to secrete, prepare for and use less of herbs.  I have used a number of different manufactures and HerbPharm is one of the best at extracting the most useful constituents from the herbs. They also are ethical manufacturers who grow or ethically source their herbs.  This is wild yam, which is useful for colic, menstrual pain and spasms.  (In the 19th century it was known as "colic root".) It is also used by women who are menopausal and need to build their yin fluids.  It does not contain progesterone or anything the body can convert to progesterone- no wild yam does.   It is only a precursor when a laboratory is involved. But wild yam is helpful on its own terms.
