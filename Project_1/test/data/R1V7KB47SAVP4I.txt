The reputation of this film seems to precede the actual film itself. With that said, I bought this film having never really watched it before. I bought it based upon its critical acclaim and the talent involved. So after viewing this film for the very first time, I can't say I was absolutely blown away by it, but I will say that's a pretty good film. I enjoyed the basic plot of the film: The year is 2019, and a 21st Detective (Harrison Ford) is ordered to kill a small group of fugitive "replicants", or androids, that have come to Los Angeles. Of course, there is other sub-plots to the story, as well as a deeper meaning overall, but since this is such a popular movie, I wouldn't expect that there aren't as many under-privileged people out there as myself who would be reading or commenting about this film without knowing much about the story first! Anyway, I did enjoy the story to the film. Of course, the acting is good. With Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer, especially, putting on great performances. The sequences between these two during the last 20 minutes or so the film are wonderful. But what I loved most about the film was the setting and atmosphere. There are some really elaborate sets in this film. The lighting, and lack of lighting at times, really sets the mood and tempo of the film. And the gritty feel of the streets of futuristic Los Angeles is done really well. However, there were a few little things that I was expecting to be better with this film. From reading the back of the DVD, it made is sound this film was packed with action, when in fact, there just isn't many true action sequences in the film. There's one chase scene and of course the climatic ending, but that's about it as far as any lengthy action scenes. With that said, I feel there are certain slow spots in the film where it kinda dragged a bit. But other than that, this film is good. Its definitely worth purchasing at this price. Especially when this DVD comes with 3 different commentaries and a 3 and a half hour "Making Of" documentary. No, this isn't as in depth as the 5-disc collection. but if you're not a hardcore fan of the film, and just want a more affordable packaging to the film, this one is for you.
