The Bible works to firmly establish in the minds of mothers how crucial their unique position of mom really is.Some of the features include book introductions, special sections that include articles, and a topical index. The special sections are interesting. It contains a very well written introductory paragraph on the topics of Creation, evolution, and science. Verses for meditation are highlighted.The notes are by far the best feature of this Bible. Most of the questions and answers are really good- short and sweet, and to the point.The hard cover seems sturdy. The fonts are nice and readable. I'm not sure of this font-size, but it looks like 8-point.I don't really like how the New Century Version reads. If the goal was to go with a modern version I would have preferred the New King James. Some verses, such as Isaiah 9:6, lose impact.This Bible suggests that you should write notes in the margin of your Bible, but the margins are too small to write notes of any significance. The floral printing in the margin is pretty, but it would have been better to have a slightly larger, clear margin for writing. The floral backgrounds behind some of the text give this Bible a slightly elegant feel, but can look a little too busy.I do recommend this Bible for its notes. The notes make this Bible worth buying. It's an excellent Bible for what it is. It fills a great need in today's world. While children are being bombarded with everything worldly, it is a great help to have a mom that can train up a child according to God's Word. It has many notes on being a better mom, and a few about better wife (which helps the mom to be a good example). 4 out of 5 stars.Disclosure of Material Connection: I'd like to thank Thomas Nelson Publishers for providing me this Bible free as part of their BookSneeze.com  book review bloggers program.
