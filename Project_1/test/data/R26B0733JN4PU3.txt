However, Holly is the worst book I have ever read by Ms. Deveraux and I would suggest you save your money.  I bought this book thinking it would be a great Christmas read and like some of the other reviewers have mentioned the situations the heroine gets into are just laughable and stupid (Falling down a well and having unprotected sex with her recuser within an hour of meeting him being one).  I am wondering if Ms. Deveraux was on a deadline to submit a book for the Christmas season and she just slapped this mess together knowing that however horrible it is (believe me it is) it would still sell.Keep your money and if you have a taste for really bad porn and dumb plots check this book out at your local library.
