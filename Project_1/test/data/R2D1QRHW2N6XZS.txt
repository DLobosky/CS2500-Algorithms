I made the mistake of purchasing one of these at the AT&T store for a ridiculous price compared to Amazon.  Perhaps for $10 it is worth having, but my cases has already worn away the color around the edges of the screen from playing games and using the phone.  I haven't had it for much longer than a month and the wear started to show very quickly.  Now instead of looking like a cool metallic case, it looks like a cheap while plastic case that was once painted a cool metallic color.  Not good quality.
