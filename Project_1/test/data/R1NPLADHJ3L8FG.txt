The only differences between the 10th Edition and the Collector's Edition are that the Collector's Edition has a fourth CD with a six-month membership to World Chess Live and the packaging and CD labels which must have been done by Encore.Going over to the Ubisoft support page for the 10th Edition and downloading the 1.0.3 patch enables the game to be played without needing the CD in the drive. The FAQs have other tips as well including a link to unlock the locked sets if you're too impatient to play the 5-60 games required to have them  unlocked automatically as rewards for playing. I know that Chessmaster XI and Grandmaster are available, but this is still a great game and the reduced price can't be beat. The 10th Edition is the first time animated chess sets are used and the three sets are a lot of fun to watch and hear especially when capturing. I suspect the Clash, Fairytale, and Rubber (colorful Staunton) animated sets were intended for boys and girls, but I get a kick out of them as well.I'm running it on XP Pro and haven't encountered any problems.The lower-rated reviews by the first two reviewers listed for the Collector's Edition aren't a fair representation of this product considering that the complaints of the one reviewer who was thinking about returning it are so easily resolved by visiting the Ubisoft website.
