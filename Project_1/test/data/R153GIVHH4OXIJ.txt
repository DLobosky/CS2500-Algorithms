I bought the K2 when it came out and then the K3 (now known as the Kindle Keyboard). I was excited to see there was a new device. I knew the difference would be small. I've also ordered a Fire and a Touch. So, that's where I'm coming from with this review. I bought the Basic Kindle with ads just so I could check it out and see if I wanted to upgrade my Kindle Keyboard. The answer is... I don't know. So, I'll talk a little about the differences in this review.The page refresh and time to turn on/off is much improved. It appears to only do a full "anti-ghosting" (for lack of a better term) refresh every 6 or 7 screens. This is allowing it to put up a new e-ink screen faster. Kinda nifty. This is, by far, my favorite improvement over the previous versions.The on/off button is slightly different. There's no slide. You push it in. It's a little annoying at first, but I can see that at least it won't get snagged on things in my purse like it does now. Of course, it will probably still get bumped around and turn on. So, this is kind of a draw for me. I must have bigger thumbs than the average person ;)There's also no hinge. From looking at the photos of the covers coming for the Kindle Touch it looks like it sits in a frame of sorts now, so I'm guessing the contacts on the back is how it will charge from the device if you buy a lighted cover. The cover is a sore spot for me. I like to read in bed. I need a light and I really like having my kindle in a cover. I really want to use this one to see if I like it over my keyboard version, but this will be a tough one. I'll suck it up and get over it, a cover should be out soon-ish, right?As I mentioned, I bought the ad-supported version. The ads aren't obtrusive, they show up as screen savers and also as a little block at the bottom of the menu. They are NOT in the books at all.I don't have a library card/overdrive so I wasn't able to test that out. It does have less internal space than the Kindle Keyboard, but that's only a consideration if you're using a lot of books. This kindle also doesn't have speakers or a headset jack (remember, very basic, entry level!) so it doesn't have the need for audio files. I think the space is fine unless you must have more than 1400 books on it for some reason. Obviously, no text-to-speech on this one either.The virtual keyboard is much easier to use than I anticipated, it's pretty zippy and I was able to type up a note easily and quickly, maybe slightly slower than I can on my keyboard version. The highlighting is slightly different with two other steps put in there from what I'm used to. Most people might not notice this, but I do make notes, so I noticed it right away.The look is basically the same, same screen resolution. It is a lighter black color around the screen like a shimmery silvery black almost.Bottom line for me? I'm not sure yet what I will do with this kindle. I LOVE the faster page turns. LOVE. But the lack of a lighted cover right now (not taking off stars for that as I'm assuming that will be remedied pretty quickly). For now, I'll play with both and decide. Then decide again when my Touch gets here in November.I'll update the review when I do decide, but my gut reaction is that, page turns aside, I'll end up sticking with my keyboard version for a little while longer.-----Update: I found the covers. I couldn't find them before, but someone pointed them out. So yay! I'll pre-order one for it (wish they were available now, but at least I'll have a lighted cover!). However, after mulling it over, I think I'm going to pass this one to my daughter. ONLY because I've ordered a Touch though and I don't see the point and setting up this one with all my books and collections, etc just to have to do it again in six weeks. Otherwise, I might make the switch. I think I'll stick with the ads on the Touch as well. I don't mind them and it's a change up from the same old screen savers.
