BLACK SUNDAY is the most satanic valentine to gothic cinema ever conceived. It is not merely equal to the best of Murnau, Whale, Freund and the classic Universal Pictures tradition but surpasses all contenders with M.C. Escheresque visuals informed with the dark poetry of stylish sadism. Barbara Steele imbues her portrayal of the vampire/witch with a demonic majesty never before brought to the screen. The overpowering image of her face, a landscape of puncture wounds bearing forth wild, burning eyes promising the joys of eternal Hell, is unforgettable.
