I received my new Kindle just a couple hours ago, and I absolutely love it. I can't believe how small and lightweight it is. I've owned both the K2 and K3...this little guy is definitely the best of the bunch (I purchased the one without ads).I debated for some time whether to go with this product, or with the Kindle touch. I decided on this for a few reasons...1. I like turning the page with the buttons. I read while holding this in one hand and I can easily hit the button without moving my hand. I wasn't crazy about the swipe page turning on the Touch. I'm sure you can still do it using one hand, but I just prefer the buttons. Also, I read on a couple review sites that every 6 pages or so the Touch needs to 'refresh', which can take a little longer for the next page to load. Whether this is true or not I don't know, but it would definitely annoy me if it is.2. I use this STRICTLY for reading. I don't make notes or annotations. I don't search for new books on the Kindle itself (I have a Wish List that I pull my books from and send them to my Kindle from Amazon.com), so a touch keyboard was just not necessary for me. Now...if you DO make a lot of notes or search for all your books in the Kindle store from the device itself, then I do NOT recommend this. I absolutely recommend going with the Kindle Touch. Typing out words on this is much like typing out your name on a video game. You use the 5-way controller to peck out one letter at a time.3. This device does NOT have text-to-speech. I like that. It was a useless feature on my K2 and K3 (for me at least) and I'm happy to have it gone.The only thing I wasn't crazy about was losing the 3G. I wish they offered it on this model, but no such luck. I rarely needed it, but it was nice to have for camping. I'll just have to make sure that I stock up on books before we head out since I'm not likely to get free wi-fi at many campgrounds. Obviously if you require 3G, then skip this...you'll want the Touch.Overall though, this device is pretty much exactly the same as my K2 just smaller, thanks to the missing keyboard, and lighter. I have always said, no matter which device I was using at the time, that in a fire I would save 1st my son, 2nd my Kindle. I LOVE how easy and enjoyable the Kindle has made reading (and I was already an extremely avid reader), and I can't imagine ever going back to lugging around a bunch of heavy library books. If you've read the features of this particular model and basically just want a simple e-ink e-reader, then this is for you. If you're looking for a little more out of your reader, then go with the Touch. Either way you can't go wrong with a Kindle...no matter the model.
