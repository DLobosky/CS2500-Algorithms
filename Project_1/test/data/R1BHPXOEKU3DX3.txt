However, I really didn't think she could maintain the caliber of writing and Butch's story really wasn't the one I wanted. Was I wrong? Yes, this is a marvelous continuation of the best series out there. J.R. Ward is a very surpising author and so very talented.Butch has been in love with Marissa since he met her. He finds no comfort in his new lifestyle even though he wears Armani and has everything a man could want. He doesn't have respect for himself, he wants to fight for the race he has adopted. He and the warriors of the Black Dagger Brotherhood have bonded especially he and Vishious. There is a true brotherly love between them. They share each others secrets and Vishious is not so alone anymore. Butch was a cop and his dedication to saving Beth, who became Wrath's Queen, led to his knowledge and presence in the Brotherhood. But Butch feels unworthy not only to love Marissa but because he is not allowed to fight the Lessers.Marissa was Wrath's Shellan but Wrath never loved her and even after several hundred years she is still a virgin. Butch touches something deep inside her and only her feelings of unworthiness combined with her fear that if she feeds from Butch she will kill him, keep her from falling into the arms of the human who has touched her in these unknown ways. Her relationship with her brother has fallen apart because of her feelings for a human. Her brother is a doctor and has placed Marissa on a pedestal he in unable to forgive her when she falls in love with a human. They are considered little more than animals.Butch runs into a situation where he chooses to save a pre-transition vampire from the lessers who are attacking him. He is captured and tortured by the Lessers. When the Omega finds out who Butch is he inserts an evil part of himself into Butch. Now only Marissa, the Brotherhood and the Scribe Virgin may be able to save him. But even with the changes in his body he is determined to fight and serve the ones he trusts and loves.There is a prophecy that there will come one to face the Master of evil. The fore-lesser thinks he has found him and is determined that when he dies he will not join the rest of the lessers who make up the blood and energy that flow in the veins of the Omega. Taking this man under his wing he trains him to kill lessers and waits for the transformation to take place. Now he is only concerned with saving himself from the horror that awaits all lessers.I found the book thrilling. The action is non stop, the revelations come fast and furious. I can't wait for the next episode in this wonderful drama. Do not miss this one and if you have not read the others be sure you get them and read them first. Everything makes so much more sense and the growth of the characters is  absolutely phenomenal. Loved it!!!!!
