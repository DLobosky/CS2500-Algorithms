This movie turns out to be a lot different than I thought it would be but I won't tell you why because I do not want to give it away. There are a few parts in the movie that will make you jump but it isn't that scary of a movie. It is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie. It's a great suspense/horror movie with NOT a lot of gore which I thought was awesome.The storyline and acting was amazing as well. Emily Browning (Anna) and Elizabeth Banks (Rachel) work really well together and deliver an amazing performance.I absolutely LOVED this movie. It was 100x's better than I thought it was going to be. It's kind of on the same lines as Hide and Seek so if you like that movie, you'll like this movie as well.The Uninvited has a GREAT surprise ending. Watch and find out what it is...
