Over the years, the band has been anthologized several times, but none of these compilations have gotten it right. "Greatest Hits" compiles 21 classic Huey Lewis & The News tracks, including "The Heart Of Rock & Roll", "The Power Of Love", "Jacob's Ladder", "Stuck With You", "Do You Believe In Love", "Perfect World" and "Hip To Be Square" as well as many more classics. There's some lesser known stuff included here, such as their performance of "Trouble In Paradise" at the legendary Live-Aid concert, and Huey's duet with Gwyneth Paltrow on their cover of "Cruisin'" from the film "Duets". The sound quality is superb (good sound quality is a must when I buy a greatest hits compilation), and just about eveyr bit hit is here.The cd also comes with a bonus dvd that contains several of their videos and a live performance from 1982 of "Workin' For A Livin'". This is a great compilation that belongs in anyone's record collection.
