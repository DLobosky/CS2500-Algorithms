Especially for the younger generation, most of these will seem very surprising, since anyone born after about 1970 will probably have been well immersed in the "need" for commercial products.  While not all of the "grandma's way" products are harmless, many of them are probably less harmful and more effective than some of those made commercially.  They certainly cost considerably less.  Again, care in storage around children and pets is just as important as it is with the fancier products with catchy trademark names.  It doesn't matter if a child drinks Scrubbing Bubbles or similar solution or plain bleach, the overall effect will be the same:  a very unpleasant death.  Responsible parenting is something that is not yet bottled! Some of the advice on furniture is very good, because it provides the reader with what is essentially a quick and dirty course on the construction of furniture and thereby what it takes to produce a well made item.  I learned some of this from my Aunt Dorothy, who used to appraise antiques for a bank, and some of it from courses I took on cabinet making.  The advice will help  pick out the level of quality available at the price asked so that the consumer can better judge if he or she is actually getting a "bargain."  Also, and more helpfully, the author gives advice that will help the reader triage the decision as to just how much quality is necessary at the given price to meet actual needs.  Purchase of a high end leather couch even if it's less expensive than usual, when you know you own a tiger that will eat the thing, is probably not the best choice.The advice on big ticket electronics is good, but many readers will probably already know these suggestions; much of it is simply common sense.  A good perusal of the most recent index for Consumer's Digest or similar magazine at the library may well provide one the information one needs to pick out a decent product.  Another good method is to check the Amazon.com site for the product and read the "reader" reviewer's appraisal of the products under consideration; believe me, if they've had a lemon, they'll tell you so and often tell you why.  I've rarely been mislead regarding a product based on these critiques.The author's surprisingly thorough advice on clothing purchase is very astute, though I agree with him that teenagers are not likely to cooperate with it.  After all, the merchandisers of the world have been targeting this age group since I was a kid in the 1960s, and they know how to manipulate them very expertly through the peer group.  If a parent hasn't already instilled common sense and decision making skills in their offspring by age twelve, it's a hopeless cause after that.  Most Moms have probably already figured out the "share-the-little-kids-clothes" trick.  I have a friend who had 5 children, almost all of them female, and had all the clothing sorted out in boxes according to age.  Once she'd made certain there would be no further pregnancies, she started loaning things out to co-workers who were just starting their families.  (The ICU and PACU units I worked on were almost a continuous used clothing and children's furniture exchange.  "Need a crib?  Call the nurses on surgical intensive care!!!")  The items definitely got "used," something that doesn't happen unless Mom is a very frugal, careful, well organized, and farsighted person.  Ann is certainly that!  The information on vacations and on computers is rightly very cautious.  So much changes with respect to these categories, that the internet is almost certainly the reader's best bet for information regarding them, which the author freely admits. A generally useable book, much common sense, a little dated.
