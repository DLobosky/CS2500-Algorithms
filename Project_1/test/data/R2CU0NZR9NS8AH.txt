Initially, he finds this adventure to be exciting, liberating and great fun. Soon he realizes a pirate's life is not exactly ideal. There's no tucking in, no books, and no goodnight kisses! Of course, a storm must swoop down on the ship and the treasure is in peril. Jeremy has the ideal solution, which you'll love. This is a truly fun book for children ages 4-9.  My students really enjoy this as a read aloud and then being able to revisit it on their own.
