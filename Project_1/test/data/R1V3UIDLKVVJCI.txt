What works for one child, might now work for another child and I appreciate that all children with special needs are not lumped into one.  We all have to work with our OTs, STs, PTs, etc., to find what works best for our individual children.  This DVD goes through an entire day starting with waking up, having breakfast, and getting ready for school.  She immediately gives tips on dressing and morning manic energy and where to direct it.  As someone that works with several special needs children, Britt knows the struggles we face and she addresses them and provides useful strategies.  The information covered includes fine motor skills, gross motor (trampolines, jumping, crashpads, tunnels, etc), stuff you can do in the afternoon when your kids have a lot of extra energy and need to calm their bodies.  She goes over homework (be consistent with school OT) and dinnertime (be prepared, involve the kids in preparation if possible) and bedtime (lights, sensory needs, accommodations).  I found the chapters about "Organization of Behavior" and "Individual Sensory Needs" most helpful.  They cover weighted vests, weighted blankets, calming strategies, ways to re-direct behavior and encourage using ones words.  Mrs. Collins is always respectful with the children, but firm.  She's an excellent role model.  There is a chapter on Aquatic Therapy, which didn't resonate with me until I looked into my local YMCA.  I hadn't thought of therapy in a pool, but am not finding it useful and my son loves it.  Four other OTs contributes their knowledge on this DVD.  Dr. Thompson has an amazing playroom and she gives tips on decorating around sensory needs.
