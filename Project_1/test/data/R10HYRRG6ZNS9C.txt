Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album that their record label, Reprise, deemed the album unsuitable and didn't want to release.  Thankfully someone at Nonesuch Records, saw the album's first rate quality and released it (Ironically, AOL Time Warner is the parent company to both labels).  While country in essence, the band employs eerie piano riffs, synthesizers and close-mike vocals that have more in common with Radiohead than Merle Haggard.  Wilco leader and lead singer Jeff Tweedy embodies the songs he sings.  On &quot;I'm Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; he sings in a drunken slur that vividly portrays the song's drunk protagonist.  &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is a power pop gem that uses jangling guitars that remind one of R.E.M.'s college rock days.  The album is full of glorious and diverse sounds like dobros, brass, synth, steel guitars and various guitar riffs from metal to funk.  Wilco suffered some loses in personnel on this album, but the casualties are worth the price for this brilliant piece of musical stew.
