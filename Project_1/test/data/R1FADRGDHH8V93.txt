The book didn't make me laugh out loud like the critic quote's pasted inside the front cover say they did. It did get a good chuckle out of me but more importantly it kept my interest through the end.The strangeness yet believability of the characters and the situations where "if it can go wrong it does" keept me turning pages.I liked it enough that I want to give Hiassen another shot especially after reading some of the reviews on his other works.
