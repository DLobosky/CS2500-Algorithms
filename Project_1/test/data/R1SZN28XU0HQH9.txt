He is the most intriging character I have encountered in some time.Zsadist is the brother of Phury, they are twins, but he was kiddnapped as a baby and sold as a Blood Slave. He lived in captivity and torture for many yrs until Phury found him and saved his life. But he was so damaged by his captor that they have no hope for him to ever live a normal life. He seems to only embrace violence. With his scarred face and body he is an anomoly in the Vampire world. Since he is a born warrior he lives and fights with the Black Dagger Brotherhood. They protect the other vampires from the lessers, men who have given up their souls to the Omega, for the power to kill. The Omega wants to destroy all vampires.Bella is a vampiress, who is a friend of the human woman who is bonded to Rhage. Rhage is one of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. There are only 6 Warriors in the Brotherhood now, but Wrath, the king, is haveing some others trained to join. When Bella meets Zsadist she is fasinated and a bit frightened by him. He is so solitary. Later she is kidnapped by the leader of the lessers. She looks like his deceased wife and he clings to her and thinks he loves her. This does not stop him from tortureing and beating her up. She is kept in a hole in the ground and must listen as other captured vampires are tortured and murdered. For some reason her mind turns to Zsadist and she prays for her rescue.Zsadist searches for her with a vengence. Surprising his brothers, he returns to her house many times. Somehow she has reached into the Darkness that surrounds him. When he finally rescues her she is damaged, too. In her pain she turns to him and he struggles to find some humanity in his soul to help her. The brothers are stunned to find him cuddling her in his room, because since his rescue he has been unable to touch and let others touch him. He has refused to eat or feed properly. He has only fed from prostitutes. Touching only their neck. The leader of the lessers has not given up, he is still looking for his "wife". I loved this book and it was so full of new revelations about the Brotherhood. I have enjoyed all three of the books in this series and am now looking forward to the next. Do not miss this one.
