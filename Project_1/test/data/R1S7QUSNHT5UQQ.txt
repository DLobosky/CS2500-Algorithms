I have three other Pantera albums, Far Beyond Driven, Vulgar Display of Power, and The Great Southern Trendkill.  They are all great, but Cowboys From Hell is my favorite.  If you are new to Pantera, but you like Metal, definitely get this album.  If you like it as much as I think you will, get the other three that I mentioned.  Then you will have yourself a nice little Metal collection.
