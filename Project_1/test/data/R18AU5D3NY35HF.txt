She did not want to be holding a bottle when she was shopping or in a Dr's office etc. This bottle did the job, plus it also fits nicely in a car cup holder. This is an all stainless steel bottle with no paint on it and has a wide mouth. The cap comes off and on with 3 half turns, which is nice and easy. There is an exellent seal on the cap when tightened down, I have not had any problems with Gen Med bottles leaking. Quite a few reviewers mention the clips on Gen Med bottles look weak, but none ever said it broke. It's stainless steel with a strong spring on it and definitely does not look weak to me.  The bottle will sweat if you put ice water in it. If needed my wife will wrap it in a quality paper towel, which obsorbs the moisture nicely. This is a very nice smaller bottle.I have not had any problems with a metallic taste. I first wash it thoroughly, and than soak it in a vinegar solution before using it.
