Marshall Fine's blatant bashing of this movie is snobbery at its best. This movie you will notice from all the REAL people show it to be a entertaining romp with Dennis Quaid, Kathleen Turner, and Stanley Tucci at their best. If Quiad beating the tar out of Tucci with a baby stroller doesn't make you laugh, then the reparte between Quaid and Turner or the inept often funny remarks by Obba Babbatunde and Larry Miller should. My wife and I love this movie and wish they had done a sequel to it. If you like movies like "True Lies", "The In-Laws", or any other comedy spy movie that includes funny family relations you will enjoy this movie. It is deifinitely a few notches above "Spy Kids" or "I Spy" We are hoping this will be released on DVD as I am sure are many others.
