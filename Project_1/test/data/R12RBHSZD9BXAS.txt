Stop resisting, start at the beginning, go out and pick up a copy of Outlander and you will not stop until you have read all of the books in the series!Ms. Gabaldon writes such strong, individualistic characters and her plots are well thought out and drawn together very nicely. Her writing is imaginative, original and well-researched. There are so many stand-out scenes in this book, so many intense experiences for both the characters and the reader. Claire and Jamie Fraser are two of the most engaging, well-written characters I've ever encountered - so complex, and yet so simple at the core. Theirs is a wonderful adult love story that endures throughout all of the books. Ms. Gabaldon is truly talented. I only wish I had discovered this series years ago!
