Was really disappointed in the freshness of this coffee.  I just got my Senseo machine and ordered this variety pack so I could try different blends.  I had my doubts about pre-made coffee pods, but so many reviewers raved about the coffee, I decided to put aside my doubts.The Kona blend didn't smell good when I first opened the package.  You know how fresh coffee is supposed to smell.  This wasn't even close: thin, acidic, and even kinda rancid.  And that pretty much describes the brewed coffee.  Bad.  I poured it out and tried the dark roast that came with my new machine.  It was better than the Kona, but not even close to what I would have expected, based on the stellar reviews here.  It kind of reminded me of coffee that had been sitting on a burner a little too long.  Next I tried the Columbian, which is generally my favorite when I buy whole-bean coffee.  I was brewing into a mug, by the way, so I was using double pods for all these trials.  The Columbian smelled good when I opened the package--the way FRESH coffee is supposed to smell.  The coffee was light-years better than the first two kinds, but the best coffee on the planet?  Not really.The Sumatran blend smelled okay, too.  Not hit-you-in-the-face amazing, but pretty good.  The coffee was also okay--not as fresh-tasting as the Columbian, but still better than the Kona blend.  I'll admit I haven't tried the Kenyan variety yet, since it's usually not my favorite, so I can't comment on it.  Besides, I'm PLENTY caffeinated at this point!  The bottom line is, the Columbian and the Sumatran were worth the convenience of the Senseo machine, but they definitely don't stand up against freshly-ground beans brewed in a drip coffee pot or French press.For convenience and novelty of the Senseo system, I'd give 5 stars.  But for the actual flavor of the coffee: lots of room for improvement.  Turns out I was right to be skeptical of pre-made pods.  Maybe I got a bad batch but I really don't get what all the fuss is about.  Meh.
