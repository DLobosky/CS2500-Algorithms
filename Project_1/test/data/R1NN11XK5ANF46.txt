Also in the package is a request for Jack to meet up in a warehouse for a super secret meeting. Jack, who doesn't completely believe his brother, changes his mind at the meeting after they come across some alien technology. After they are attacked by aliens, Jack escapes with Bridget Riordan (Jane Sibbett), one of the few reporters who actually believed in Zane's story. With the alien technology in hand, Jack and Bridget begin to run for their lives while trying to continue Zane's wish, to reveal to the aliens evil plan to the human race before it's too late. Wow. Talk about hard to get through. I can't believe I've now seen this movie twice. The first time I saw this I must have drowned everything I saw in this movie with a 24 pack of beer because if I had remembered how bad this was, there would've been no way I would've watched it again. I would've just lied on this review. The cg effects were horrendous. I mean horrendous. I think with 45 minutes of CG training, I could have produced 80% of the stuff they did in here. The CG back drops were so plain it was ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, I would love to had seen how thick this script was. I swear most of the movie was just our heroes running away from the villains. For example... the aliens drug Jack with what seems to be a syringe of Jack Daniels. Because when he falls out of the vehicle they were transporting him in, he just begins to stumble, quickly though, away. How the aliens couldn't catch up to him I'll never know. He just stumbles along through a train station and out to a train (guess you don't need money or a ticket to get on a train) while a big dumb alien runs after him. Jack somehow tricks the alien to get on the train. Jack then begins to stumble away again, right into another alien who holds up a syringe. Jack falls down into the rail tracks. Stumbles and falls into more train tracks. Then gets up on the other side and starts to stumble into the railway station again. Now the alien decides to get him, by walking of course. As she 'chases' him through the railway station and then outside it, Bridget pulls up in a car (how she knew where he was I'll never know that either) and then the Alien decides to start running. So so so stupid. The acting is bad, the story is bad, the action is bad, the cg is bad, the..the..um...uh...oh I know, the *insert anything you want here* is bad. Just stay away. Stay very far away. P.S. I've never liked Patrick Muldoon. Didn't like him in Starship Troopers either. Know why? Because he stole Kelly from Zack in Saved by the Bell. What a poop head!
