I bought these speakers to improve the quality of sound from my MacBook. I live in a small dorm room and use my computer for listening to music and watching movies. For the price, these speakers provide a clear listening experience while punching out enough bass. I listen to a lot of soundtracks and so appreciate hearing clarity on instrumental parts and also being able to feel bass in the loud dramatic portions. The speakers are so much better than my tinny laptop speakers. In listening to a Christopher Parkening CD, I could hear depth in the sound of the acoustic guitar that did not come through from those speakers. Sure, these aren't audiophile quality, but for the price they provide great sound for the average listener who wants to improve his computer sound. They don't take up much space; I have them set up on my small dorm room desk with the sub on a shelf above. The volume control is on a convenient small wired remote that lets you power on and off the speakers.Cons: the audio cables could be longer from the speakers to the sub. I would have liked to set the sub on the floor instead of a shelf, but the length of the cables did not allow for this to happen comfortably the way my room is set up. There is no headphone jack (many comparably priced speaker systems offer one). The bass control is on the back of the sub and can be annoying to adjust depending on how you have them set up.Honestly, these are minor issues for me, especially for the price. I'd recommend these to anyone on a budget.Update: had to return these because of static coming from the left speaker
