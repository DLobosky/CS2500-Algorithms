It's very easy to accidently put a bit more on your "target" then you initially wanted. This one burns at just about 120,000 scoville units so it's not one to play with... but it is the weakest sauce in the Da Bomb line. This sauce was created right around the time when Daves Insanity Sauce was becomming big. The name of this sauce "Beyond Insanity" is an obvious marketing scheme to show that this sauce is bigger and badder then Daves Insanity... and it is. I love it! I love the unique flavors of the Da Bomb line. All three of the sauces have a really nice pipe tobacco-like smell. I'm talkin' premium quality pipe tobacco. All three of them are also a bit fruity because they are made with juices such as pineapple or orange juice.If you are a beginner with hot sauces then this might be a good start. It does have a good lasting burn but it's not too over the top. I would probably stay away from Ground Zero and DEFINITELY stay away from The Final Answer if you have an untrained palate. This one will provide plenty of burn. Be careful with these sauces because Da Bomb sauces veeery slowly get hotter and hotter. Its very easy to accidently eat too much because of this.
