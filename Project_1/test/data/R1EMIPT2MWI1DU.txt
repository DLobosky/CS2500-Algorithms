The Old Man and the Sea lets us see our own lives more clearly, by experiencing the challenge to and empathizing with the fisherman in this classic tale of man versus nature and man versus himself that explores the  true nature of human nobility.  Even if the story was not so compelling  and universal in its appeal and themes, the book is worth the trip just for  the writing.  Simple words, simple sentences, and metaphors on top of  metaphors make for a magnificent experience for you.  Seldom has so much  complexity been portrayed with such simplicity.  What's even more  astonishing is how short this novella is.  Amazing!  Just to let you  know how much I love this book, The 2,000 Percent Solution was designed to  draw on many of the novel's elements to convey important  ideas.Communication is what people have the most trouble with in  cooperating with each other.  Any time you run into that stall, think about  how Hemingway would have solved the problem.  Tell a story like this one  that makes the point you want to share.  Read this book, reread this  book, and enjoy ... enjoy ... enjoy!
