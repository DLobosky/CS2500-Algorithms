I grew up on this stuff - I may well have seen Santa Claus Is Comin to Town when it first aired in 1970 when I was just entering school, and of course their first production, Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer was a staple of my childhood as well.  By 1985 I was in college but I still had a lot of nostalgia for these shows - and still do.  And I knew the name of L. Frank Baum, the writer of the first 14 "Oz" books, and of the 1902 book this was based on; in fact, I'd read and loved the book.  Would the TV adaptation hold up?It did, miraculously.  Sure, the songs have that typical Rankin-Bass cheesiness, and don't really seem all that necessary, helping to eat up precious minutes that could have been spent on more of the plot of the book - but overall, this is more faithful in spirit than most fantasy film adaptations of the classics have been.  The Great Ak (voiced by Alfred Drake, excellent) recounts the tale of Claus, a mortal who was abandoned in the Forest of Burzee, the domain of immortal wood-nymphs, and raised by one of the nymphs, Necile.  Shown the depressing and warlike state of mankind by Ak as a young man, Claus grows up to devote his life to making children happy - he is thwarted many times by the evil Awgwas, but eventually prevails, and as an old man he is honored by being given the Mantel of Immortality, the only human ever deemed worthy to receive it.THE LIFE & ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS was an attempt by Baum to locate Santa Claus as a part of a central "American mythology" that he was trying to create out of nursery rhymes, his own Oz books, and 19th century tall tales.  It didn't all quite come together, and sadly, apart from Oz, most of Baum's stories and ideas have vanished a hundred years later.  But his central notions of fairness and equality as opposed to greed and the domination of the rich and powerful still come through in this story and this adaptation, which is very much in the typical Rankin/Bass house style - slow puppet movements, relatively simple backgrounds, bright colors.  The songs are mostly in the first few minutes and obtrude less than in some of the other shows, and the voice talents in this case aren't provided by celebrities but rather by professional voice actors, which is all to the good I think.  It might come off as a little bit odd to younger people today who don't know the writings of L. Frank Baum, and who perhaps didn't grow up on this kind of primitive stop-motion animation, which had hardly changed since the early 1960s - but it's heartfelt and full of joy for anyone who can get past the "dated" element.  It's probably my favorite of all of these programs, and one I watch every year.As many other reviews have stated, we've been waiting a long while for a DVD.  Well, there is one available now, but unfortunately it's just a DVD-r that's part of Warner Brothers' pricey on-demand service.  It comes with "Nestor" and you can find it here.  Meanwhile if you don't want to shell out for that disc, this old VHS is perfectly serviceable - let's hope someone wises up someday and puts this out in a big deluxe package, maybe every Rankin-Bass Christmas special all in one box.  Wouldn't that be a wonderful gift for the child in all of us?
