As a boy, I used to watch Bugs Bunny, which I realized, as I got older, was written on two levels ... slapstick humor for kids and wry asides for adults.  As a young and then an increasingly older adult, I enjoyed other shows that could entertain both audiences ... shows such as "Ren and Stimpy" (although perhaps a bit violent for some children), "Rugrats", and "Jimmy Neutron", among others.I recently discovered "Phineas and Ferb" on the Disney Channel, or should I say my kids did.  They requested more episodes to watch, so I bought this DVD, which contains close to 2 hours of entertainment.  Although the format is somewhat repetitive (Phineas and Ferb build something ingenious and way-over-the-top item in their back yard while their sister Candace tries and fails to get the boys in trouble by squealing to their parents, while their pet Perry the Platypus, who lives a double life as a secret agent, foils the plans of evil-doer Dr. Doofenshmirtz), each show is inventive, fresh, and funny.  While my kids are enthralled, often one of my children will ask me "What are you laughing at, Daddy?", so it indeed works for multiple audiences.  Each show also features a song or two, many of which are so catchy that they could be top 40 pop hits (some even have my 5 year old son dancing, and he doesn't dance.)  :-)  My more staid wife was getting a little concerned that I was happily watching a kiddie show, until she sat down and watched a few episodes.  Now she's a fan, too.  Highly recommended for those with kids and even for those without.
