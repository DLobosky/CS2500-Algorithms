AAD (Art Architecture Design) Rome is for the person that wants a much richer, deeper experience visiting this amazing city. It is also directed at the well travelled urban or metropolitan person.  The book is fairly small and lightweight; it is a little larger than a CD case. Unlike the standard travel guides, this guide fits easily in my hand; carry on luggage, my iPad sleeve, or a purse. This beautiful book is easy to carry around. This guide tries to focus on the unusual off the beaten path locations. The book is divided into Art, Architecture, and Design. The name of this book is unfortunate; AAD doesn't roll off the tongue very well and is too close to ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).  Each subject is covered in two to four pages of beautiful photographs, one succinct paragraph (repeated in four different languages), and thumbnail visiting facts (especially important are the websites for detailed information). Some of the descriptions were like advertising copy, but mostly they were direct and to the point. The strongest section in this book is Design. The chapter is subdivided into Hotels, Clubs, Restaurants, and Shops. These are all unusual places not found in other guidebooks. They are the kind of place Romans would know and frequent. There is enough variety in the suggestions to please most tastes. In the Design chapter there are descriptions of a few hotels. These are completely different from the hotels listed in Cool Rome (Cool Rome - the companion travel guide by TeNeues) and are actually much cooler or funkier than the hotels listed in Cool Rome. The hotels in AAD Rome would be on my list to visit, just to see one of the rooms, restaurant, or lounge. Fortunately, the book leaves out the long discussions about accommodations, how to get around the city, the cultural differences, and some form of crash course in Italian. In my view, those are subjects that are best left at home once the pre-trip planning is completed. But I do need a book that can guide me to some amazing places I might not already know. Give me just enough information to tweak my curiosity and then allow me to discover that place. The web addresses are helpful to find the most current practical information. The section that didn't work very well for me was Architecture. I felt that it was too much of the same major landmarks everyone mentions. There wasn't enough unusual or undiscovered in that chapter. Art was moderately more successful, with some interesting off the beaten path galleries listed. But here again, there were many old standards present. The book is beautifully printed and published. The details are remarkable. Inside the front and back cover there is an orange piece of paper to cover the fold over front and back covers - just like a fine book. The photographs are amazing, as I would expect from this publisher. The binding is rugged and the paper stock heavy. A small nit to pick is two pages wasted on a map. There is no way anybody could navigate the city with this small-stylized map. On the other hand there are three pages with beautiful frank descriptions of each area of Rome. In few words, the core sense of the area is described. TeNeues has published an iPad / iPhone companion app to the Cool City / AAD series. This is an incredibly beautiful app. If you have a data plan for Italy, the app can use your location to show how far away something is, show the place on a highly detailed map (the built in Google map), present a slide show of the location, and with an optional spoken word description. In the iTunes App store, search for Cool Cities. Although it was designed for iPhone size, the 2X version on an iPad is still sufficiently high resolution. Navigation in the app is a bit odd at first, but after a few uses it is easy to use. The publisher provided me with a free copy of this book for review.
