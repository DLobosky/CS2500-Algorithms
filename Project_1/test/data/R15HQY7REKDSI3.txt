I liked it so much I bought it and took it with me to a recent 8-day visit to the state, and was able to give it an "on the ground" trial.The Moon guides are unique in the depth of coverage.  No sketchy descriptions of attractions here--each place is covered in detail and depth.  The Utah guide includes the "little things" that might interest you no matter what kinds of scenery or attractions you like--or you can pass them by.  The maps are good, but of course no book map can replace a good full-size folding map. Sidebars or "boxes" in the text pick out particular bits of information that make the area come alive.The guide is not as complete about hotel/motels as some, but I belong to AAA for that kind of information, which becomes out of date as soon as any guide is published anyway.The quality of any guide book, whether Moon or Lonely Planet, or whatever, depends on its authors.  This one hits the mark.
