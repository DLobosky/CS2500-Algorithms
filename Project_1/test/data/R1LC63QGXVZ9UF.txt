Being the first Sequel to the brilliant 1978 Halloween Horror Classic, Halloween II (1981) is clearly flawed but clearly still delivers.  First of all I think It was kind of difficult to come up with a first sequel for such a great part one that came three years earlier.  With that being said, It left off directly from the ending of the first Halloween.  It brought back all the main characters from the first one as well.  The movie also serves it's purpose explaining why Michael want's to kill his sister Laurie Strode (Played By Jamie Lee Curtis).  But the Dr. Sam Loomis (Played by Donald Pleasence) is out to stop the Evil Michael Myers from wrecking havoc even some more from earlier that day which was shown in Halloween I.  The problem with Halloween II is that, Michael Myers Was shown a bit too much opposed to the first installment which made part II lack the suspense of the original.  It's like he was the main character in this movie, especially the first half.  Another thing is that this one had more gruesome bloody death scenes which were unnecessary.  Part One showed almost no blood and still found a way too be scary.  A large part of the movie took place in an empty hospital which made the atmosphere more creepy.  I thought that maybe they should not have shown too much of the movie inside the hospital, but I feel it certainly did not ruin the movie.  As for the supporting cast which was mostly people who worked in the hospital they were not terrible but after a while the viewer might be wanting Michael too kill them, due to them being a little annoying.  Donald pleasence intense acting once again did a great job in this one as Michael Audrey Myers Doctor.  Jamie Lee Curtis also did a solid job acting as a great scream queen,  but I wish they had spent less time showing curtis lying in hospital bed throughout the movie.  Curtis however, played a vital role in the movie's intensifying ending.  When you compare Halloween II to the rest sequels in the series or any other horror movie sequels or sequel's in the entire movie industry there was not many other ways this movie could have been better.  Don't get me wrong Halloween II has it's faults but at the end it turn's out to be one hell of a ride.
