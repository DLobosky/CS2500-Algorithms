However, I was extremely frustrated by the fact that there are no chapter marks for the episodes.  The special features on the disc really weren't very impressive.  "The Cast" features six of the characters; when you select one of the characters, you just see a brief scene featuring that character.  Personally, I thought this feature was rather pointless.On both discs of episodes, you can also see the songs from the English dub of the anime of the various duels.  This was a nice idea in theory, but it doesn't work very well.  The dialogue for the duels is left in, which already makes it hard enough to hear the songs.  But the audio quality for most of the songs in this feature is rather low and muffled, which makes this feature almost unlistenable.When it comes to movie, I really didn't care for it.  A number of changes were made to the characters, whether it was in their design or in their backstories.  I ultimately have to look at Adolescence of Utena as a kind of "warp speed, alternate timeline" movie.Overall, this is a decent collection if you enjoy the series.
