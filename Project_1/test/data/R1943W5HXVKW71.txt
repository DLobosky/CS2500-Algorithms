(1) No females would be born to the females of the island and (2) the males of the island would not find love until the Lady of the Isle mated with an Irish man with black hair and green eyes.  The curse even applies to men and women who leave the island.  BA (BarbaraAnne) is the current Lady of the Isle.  She is a descendant of Maeve (the woman who was cursed).  She inherited wealth created by her grandfather Sean.  She uses her wealth to improve the lives of the men on the island.  Recently she set up a matchmaking website inviting single women to come to the island.  She pays their expenses to come meet potential husbands.  Desmond is of Irish descent and has black hair and green eyes.  He comes to the island with plans to build a resort.  He also has other motives which could hurt BA.  He and BA are lustfully drawn to each other.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The plot was weak.  It seemed most of the story consisted of everyday activities and conversations among the people living on the island.  The author used a lot of cute names and references to celebrities and movies which is fine, but I would have preferred more interesting actions, motivations and events.  I lost interest and wanted it to be over.  I found myself skimming some parts in the middle of the book.  The main plot about Desmond's business plan which could hurt BA was not developed.  And at the end, details about what happened with the business issues were never explained.  I wanted the details.  The sex scenes were ok but could have used a little more emotional draw.The best parts of the story (which surprised me) were BA's actions after she learned about Desmond's plans.DATA:Story length: 341 pages.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 8.  Total number of sex scene pages: 18.  Setting: current day Falgannon Isle, off the coast of Scotland and Ireland.  Copyright; 2006.  Genre: contemporary fantasy romance.
