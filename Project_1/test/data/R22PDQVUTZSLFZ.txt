I usually do not like dystopian novels.  Current headlines are bad enough without looking into a future where the US has become enmeshed in an economic and ecological nightmare.  I do like mystery novels though.  I've  always been fond of the theory that mysteries are popular in times of  stress because they demonstate the triumph of order over chaos when the  culprit is identified and the rule of law takes over.  Which may explain  why I like these novels.Detective Ty Merrick due to an encounter with  a defective heater's fumes, has become a modern lycanthrope.  She has what  she describes as &quot;stretches&quot; where she changes mentally and  physically.  Her partner LaRue collects Soviet Communism and drives an  antique East German Trabrant with a spring necked plastic statue of Lenin  that with each bump bobs its head and squeaks &quot;comrade, comrade.&quot;   They struggle to maintain order in a world where there are constant  shortages, all officials are corrupt and most of the populations manages to  bridge the gap between what is provided by the state and what they need to  survive by scavaging while they rely on supersition and magic to try to  gain some control of their environment.Which leads  back to the theory  about mysteries.  By continuing to do their job in the midst of intolerable  conditions, Ty and LaRue show some order does exist, there is some hope  when they suceed in solving a crime that order can be restored at least to  some small part of the world.the books, by the way, should be read  sequentially to appreciate the evolving nature of Ty's lycanthropy.
