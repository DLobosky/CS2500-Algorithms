I had the Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for about 6 months and was pretty happy with it. It received 16 channels but missed ABC and NBC (ch 2 and 4 here in NYC). I read in some forums that the Paper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA! would work better. I had doubts as the Terk had an amplifier and looked more serious. There was a deal on the other antenna for $35 (same price as I paid for this one) and I was really surprised! The Leaf picked up 27 channels - including the much missed and desired NBA and ABC. I'm selling my Terk on ebay right now. So for those browsing for the best antenna, should consider the Leaf.
