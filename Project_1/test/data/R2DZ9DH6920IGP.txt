This is definitely one of the most realistic motion pictures ever released. Scene-for-scene, you can really visualize these terrible events actually occurring. The acting is top-notch here as well. Again, &quot;realistic&quot; is the key word here. They don't seem to be actors at all! J.T. Walsh is especially effective as the film's #1 villain. This should be in everyone's video library!
