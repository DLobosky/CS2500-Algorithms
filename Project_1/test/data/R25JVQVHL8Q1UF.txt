Makes me remember of Crazy Machines: The Wacky Contraptions Game This one plays beautifully on Kindle fire. The Free Version reviewed here was completed by my better half in less than 2 hours! (She is a Math teacher with logical mind no wonder why!)All-in-one a funny game perfect for people who likes to have a laugh while solving strategic moves and solving a messy plumbing job! (The Little Dragon needs a bath and you get him the required water thru' the mess of tubes and contraptions)The Ads are not very intrusive either. For Free Price this is a very good game.For nice family fun. This is definitely a game to try!
