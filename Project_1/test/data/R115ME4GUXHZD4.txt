I can tell my students all that information that has been written about in this book while they use a book which gives them hands on practice.  I read it all they way through and found it dry and rather boring.  I made the plunge and bought book 2 but was not very impressed with it either.IMHO, if you are wanting to learn how to play the classical guitar badly enough to try and sit through and read all this stuff, then you really need to hire a teacher.  Method books are good up to a point, but they will never replace what a teacher can do.  This book should have been cut in half and stuck to front of the 2nd book.  I've had the book for a couple of years now and only occasionally refer to it.  All the information is given in other method books that also include tangible exercises.UPDATE:  8/28/08I've been giving this book more thought.  It is loaded with good classical guitar information though I don't always agree with it.  Such as some of his right hand diagrams on page 25.  I feel the right hand fingers and strings need to meet more on the left side of the fingers and not directly straight on.  But, that's fodder for a live guitar lesson.  If you are being "self-taught" then this book is a fairly adequate substitute for a real teacher.  I would strongly suggest practicing his technical ideas using musical exercises from another book such as Christoper Parkening's, "Guitar Method, Vol. 1".  The ideal situation would be for the student to read the information in Shearer's book and then hook up with a qualified classical guitar instructor so the student could fully assimilate the information into actual practice.
