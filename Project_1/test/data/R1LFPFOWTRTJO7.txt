I think they are a pleasant purple color and when you put them by themselves (not stacked on top of each other in the container as in the picture), they are almost more of a pastel purple. Almost. I think any less color and they would be too plain, too muted. They measure approximately 1/4" in diameter, sometimes a little smaller.The biggest thing I dislike about them is that little bubble in the back shows through because these are translucent. You can see it in the picture and to me, it's even more pronounced in person. Still, they are a unique embellishment and I'm happy with my purchase.
