It may be useful for people looking for a friendly, lightweight, introductory text to personal information management (PIM) centered on Outlook. Check it out at a library or bookstore first to avoid disappointment. One bright spot is that is does have a CD with an digital version of OneNote 2003 Step-by-Step, links to web resources, and chapters from other books on things like managing contacts, calendar, and email.If you are serious about PIM or are a businessperson, I think the source material would serve you better. Start with Getting Things Done (GTD) to get a brilliant overview of how to address the overload in your life, followed by Total Workday Control 2nd edition (for Outlook 2007; use the 1st edition for earlier incarnations of Outlook) to fine tune that understanding. Finally, pick up 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to get the big picture, or as Allen calls it the "50,000 foot view level." Basically, TBYL is a chatty volume on PIM with a low signal-to-noise ratio, filled with a variety of vignettes designed to "humanize" the material. More often, they come across like testimonials and contribute more to padding the book than illustrating the point. TBYL also has the irritating habit of taking simple, workable terms (like those from GTD) and renaming them as part of the author's proprietary system. Contexts become Planning and Action Categories, Next Actions become Strategic Next Actions (SNAs) with no real advantage to the reader. One of the largest flaws in TBYL is the handling of Meaningful Objectives, which the author states several times is the "North Star and guiding light" of the system. I felt this was a useful addition to the GTD model but it is poorly handled, providing no useful organizational power to the reader. For example, the Workflow Model is introduced on p. 113, but there is no direct connection between Meaningful Objectives and SNAs. This error is corrected in the newer, 2007 version. Likewise, on p. 21, the author promises that this topic will be addressed in chapter 10 which it is not - apparently it was completely forgotten. But even if it was, why wait until the last chapter to introduce the core of the system? In fact, while Ms. McGhee spends a whole chapter kibitzing about "Approved Collecting Points," maybe 5 pages is spent on Meaningful Objectives. This glaring oversight is addressed in the in the 2007 edition, but not to any satisfying effect. To really provide Meaningful Objectives to this system, you would need something like Zen and the Art of Making a Living or the Stephen Covey materials. Another large flaw is that the author's grasp of using Outlook seems mediocre, especially in comparison to Micheal Linenberger (the author of Total Workday Control - the real Outlook on Steroids). As another reader pointed out, Ms. McGhee uses the Note's field to link projects and next actions, instead of the more powerful Task Folder's hierarchical capabilities. Another solution, which I prefer, is to link Outlook 2007 tasks to "project pages" prepared in OneNote 2007 - the two programs have options that make this linking fairly easy. Many observers have noted the inherent weakness of Outlook's project management abilities and the author offers little to address these. One last example of how concepts are gathered together but poorly organized to perform together. The author makes a good case for including metrics as part of one's PIM. She then spends only two pages on this topic, most of which is a discussion on how to link to an already prepared metrics document. I bought this book (fortunately used) at the recommendation of an Amazon reader. Hopefully this review will help you avoid a similar fate.
