The ony drawback to that mouse was the lack of a thumb-buitton and scroll wheel, but for it's time it was awesome.  Logitech has not come close to that degree of mousing perfection since...that is until the G9x.  I did not have the G9 so I can not compare them.  The last mouse I had was the G5, and there is no comparison.  First let me start with what is good about the mouse, since there is so very little that is bad.  The Good:Ergonomics - the ergonomics are about as close to perfect as you could imagine.  Just like the Wingman Gaming Mouse, it is more of a wedge shape which just seems to fit the hand perfectly.  Ergonomics are only enhanced by the multiple enclosures which have a very pleasing texture and non-slip grip.  This is a new feature not seen in any mouse before and I think it is now a must-have.Weight - As with many prior mice, you can fine tune the weight and there is a good selection of weights.  With the heaviest load it has excellent heft.Cord - Nice, long, thin, braided fabric-wrapped cord does not interefere with mouse tracking.Buttons - The buttons have a perfect action and solid detents.  The thumb buttons are positioned just right for a standard (non-claw) grip.  The scroll wheel has a very solid feel and smooth action.Ashetics - Very handsome, selectable light colors are a plus.Features - Scroll wheel can be changed from click-type to smooth-scrolling.  Selectable tracking speed is very well implemented.  Saveable game profiles with onboard memory is a nice feature if you do LAN parties.  I wouldn't use this, but nice to have anyway.Tracking - smooth and precise, as you would expect from any modern mouse. So what is bad?  Well for one thing it broke in the first week I had it.  I know things break, and I would not dock a star for that alone but this is an auspicious start for an otherwise outstanding mouse.  More importantly is that I think they left some important features out.  With your hand resting on the mouse, your 4th and 5th fingers just hang off the side...doing nothing.  Why not have a third button toward the right side to increase functionality?  If I were designing my perfect mouse, that feature would be there.  The front thumb button is difficult to reach without a claw grip.  I like the design of the Microsoft thumb buttons on their gaming mice better - with a vertical rather than horizintal orientation.  When are input device makers going to realize that it is easier to rotate the thumb rather than bend it?  The feet are not very slippery.  I replaced them with Hyperglide feet (from FrozenCPU).  Other than that I have to say that this thing is pretty close to perfect.  Hard to not recommend it for any PC gamer.  Even my wife loves the way it feels and she doesn't game at all.  Buy it - you won't be disappointed.
