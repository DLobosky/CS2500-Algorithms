Rookie narc Jake Hoyt's "training day" is his 1st day on the LAPD.  He is clueless as to what to expect, regarding good & evil as it pertains to his work.  Therefore, he cannot respond correctly, and uses the only sensibility available to him: the ability to reason, and he does so as a man of high integrity.  This is the main thread around which the whole movie is woven.  Training Day clarifies how the line between right and wrong can get blurred, for different people, as well as in different circumstances.  "Bone" (Cle "Shahid" Sloan) is an awesome natural for his part, and cute, too.
