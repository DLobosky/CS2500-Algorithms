My previous Vaio had trouble with dust and debris under the keys and this skin has eliminated any sticky keys - which is fantastic! It especially helps because my puppies have a particular fondness for walking across my keyboard or sometimes I even find them just standing on it. The skin helps protect from all sorts of abuse!People always compliment the skin and want to see and touch it and ask where I found it. Most are upset to find out that they can't get the same for their laptops. The purple color is rich and a true purple and it's looks exactly like the keys underneath.The only negative is that mine has stretched out by the arrow keys between the keyboard and number pad, so it gaps. I constantly have to realign it and make sure it is properly fitted. With the gap if liquid was spilled, it would go into the keys - the skin would not save the keyboard from water damage as others have suggested.
