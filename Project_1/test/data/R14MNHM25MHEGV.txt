Well, everybody knows the story about how an unknown songwriter named Billy Joe Shaver talked the semi-famous singer Waylon Jennings into recording his songs.  The result was the first &quot;outlaw&quot; country album.  Record producers seem to think the last person who should be consulted on their music is the musician.  Waylon, who was lonesome, on'ry, and mean, bucked the system and determined that he was going to make music his way.  &quot;Honky Tonk Heros&quot; was the result, a rough-edged collection of simple songs and spare arrangements.  Acoustic guitar and harmonica lead the instruments on most tracks.     &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot; won't sound all that revolutionary to the modern listener, but it's still good -- and I would buy this CD for the legends that surround it.  All the songs on &quot;Honky Tonk Heroes&quot; are good; probably none belong in the top ten list of Waylon's best.  My favorite is &quot;Omaha&quot; which has one of those melodies that stick in your head for days on end.  Waylon's gone now; I don't think Billy Joe ever made any money although he's now an elder statesman accepting homage from callers at his trailer house in Austin.  (I don't know whether or not he lives in a trailer house.  I just made that up cause it sounds like it should be true.)
