This is the 25th review of this disc here on Amazoon, and it's the 24th five-star review. Suffice to say, we ain't exaggeratin'.   Despite the liner notes' claim that this is a collection of tracks from shows in Paris, Copenhagen, London and Amsterdam, it is in fact entirely from the three Paris shows of the Kaya tour, on June 25, 26 and 27 of 1978, at the Pavillon Baltard in Nogent-sur-Marne. Summer in Paree!   A marvelous alchemy found in that magical city has created some of the greatest live shows ever recorded, not only in classical music but in artists as diverse as Marley, Bill Evans (Paris Concerts), and Genesis (the incomparable Seconds Out), to name a few of hundreds of incredible shows on disc and in the bootleg community. If it says Paris, give it a listen.   The Parisian vibe of elegant artistic mastery permeates this splendid display of the seductive groove and power of reggae music. Bob is in fine shape throughout, his voice clear and strong, his powers of musical hypnotism unsurpassed. Listen to the Wailers with and without Bob, and you quickly realize what a legendary spark this man carried. His deep belief in love as the ultimate power carries his music to heights most musicians don't even know exist. Marley had something to say, dammit, and he said it with unmatched passion and intensity, while still having and giving fun fun fun!! Not too much of that around anymore...   Bob's unique Rasta vibe permeates the album, which starts with his moving prayer to Jah and quickly segues into my favorite track, a perfectly jaunty Positive Vibration which has pulled me out of many a non-irie mood over the last 28 years. The crowd is in heaven, and shows it, and the mood throughout all the songs is powerfully uplifting.Babylon By Bus is a pure contact high of the very best kind!   By the way, this is what cds should be all about. The double record fits perfectly onto one disc, with excellent remastering that brings out the spirit of the music while avoiding the digital harshness that mars so many remasters. The vinyl already sounds perfect, fat and full of the Barrett brothers' insanely funky bass and drums, and the cd is, in its digital way, just as perfect, with the bonus of no track cuts. It sounds like one continuous show, featuring many of Bob's best tunes and a crowd like we rarely if ever feel these daze.   In my travels to various lands, I have found there are only two bands that everyone everywhere loves unreservedly: the Beatles and Bob Marley. Their messages speak to all people. Imagine that, folks just wanting to get along without wars and hatred and the "shitstem" that's killing our mother earth.   Imagine if Bob had lived...   When I spent time in Jamaica in the early 80s, Bob was already a deity. I was back on that gorgeous isle last month, and it looks like Bob is now God, period. His music and energy are omnipresent. His hymns to love and self-determination, and his desire to empower and unite his fractured brethren and indeed all people into a loving collective, guarantee that his songs will live for as long as people listen to music.   If you like this album, Bob has a vast catalogue starting with classic two-tone stuff in the sixties and then featuring the original Wailers, his seminal reggae group with Tosh and Bunny. There are plenty of jammin' shows in the online tape-trading community to be had from all periods, and Marley fans are, as expected, glad to share! That's what music is really all about, as Bob always pointed out: sharing the gift that life is. Please look around at various sites; seek and ye shall receive. The 1979 Santa Barbara dvd is also verrrrrry much worth finding; to see Marley in full flight is absolutely glorious and inspiring.   Bless you, Brother Bob. Your love and joy will resonate on this planet forever.
