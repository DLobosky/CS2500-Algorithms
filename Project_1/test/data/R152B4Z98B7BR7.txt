The important thing is that it does a good job of time shifting, and chase play is more convenient than on my old Toshibas, just hit the play button and it will automatically start chase play from the beginning. I miss some of the features of the Toshiba, especially chapter mute which lets you skip precisely through commercials w/o having to do it 30 sec at a time. It does, however, do something the Toshiba does not, namely, set up timer recording of programs back to back. With Toshiba you had to program those with a minute between. Not necessary to do that with this one, but there is a 3 second buffer skip.I am, however, returning this one, not because I don't like it--I do--but because I am buying the 515 for its improved features. The 515 has 500 GB hard drive, but 320 GB is enough. That's 64 hours at highest quality. If power goes out for more than 30 sec you lose all of your timer setups (but nothing on the hard drive). With the 515 you get an hour. The 515 also has an improved remote with larger buttons. That is not a little thing either. Reading and hitting those little buttons is a nuisance. I think the 515 is worth the higher price for something I will be using a lot.I think this is a very good value for the money. A used Toshiba will cost you more than this on ebay, for something you don't know how much longer it will last. My first Toshiba lasted six years and they are all going to fail eventually. Why buy one that has already used up a lot of its life when you can get a new one for less?My recommendation is to pay the extra fifty bucks and get the 515 instead, especially if your power goes out occasionally and you have to set up all your daily and weekly programs again. Plus you get the more convenient remote. A more complete review and explanation of functions is at avsforum.***I have read a few of the other reviews here. The ones that interested me most were the one star reviews. Most of these are from people who have returned more than one unit. Those reviews plus the similar complaints in the comments on them emphasize that this DVR can be difficult (for some people) to set up. The big problem is that the manual is confusing, and even wrong in places. I am pretty sure there can't be that many bad units, just wrong setups. The best way to set up properly is to visit AVS Forum (google it) and then search for this thread: Magnavox 515, 513, 2160A, 2160, 2080 & Philips 3576, 3575. You will find it more helpful than the manual. The most common problems are freezing or no power, solved with a soft reset--not in the manual and customer service is unaware of it. And save yourself more problems by setting auto clock to off. Most people have gotten it to work for them and you probably can too if you are patient. The first problem I had was getting a picture, solved by setting the correct input in the menu. Early on I also had a power problem, but fixed it as soon as I checked the details for soft reset at avsforum. I am glad I stayed with it. After using my 515 every day for four months I have yet to have a recording failure. I love it.
