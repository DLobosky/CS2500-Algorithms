While this film may appear as being a painfully long and meaningless one, it really defined the counterculture of its decade. Nevertheless, with characters who'll suppose of such mind-bending pharmaceuticals as daily substances to indulge upon, unnecessary close-ups of vomit and urine, and swooping camera movements at any and every opportunity, this very atypical film is certainly not for everyone. But for the self-seeking and fans of Hunter S. Thompson... Director Terry Gilliam, a master of complex, bizarre visual imagery, does such an outstanding job in capturing the exact intensity and utter madness of Hunter S. Thompson's classic book, which really would come as to no surprise whatsoever, as the book itself became their script! Usually after having finished with a book that's based upon a film you've previously seen, you say to yourself: "The film was nowhere near as good," unlike for this title, where both the film and book equally major. And, like the book, Gilliam really has you develop great sympathy for these very dysfunctional and fatuous people whom, as you sit there and observe of the many risks they so carelessly make, you really grow to love and don't want anything fatal to happen to them.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a pseudo-psychedelic, very colorful and stylized comedy so funny, so excruciatingly funny that the mere thought of it will draw a smirk on your face, and perhaps even have you laugh, then. And I was quite amused over the idea that Gilliam actually went as far as allowing us to enter its characters' rather hazy and indefatigable world and see it all the way they do, merely to generate greater sidesplitting and outrageous moments that are of an ideal blend for a fanatical film its kind!The performances were just incredulously stunning! In fact, these vivid actors were so persuasive, you'll forget of the fact that they were even acting at all, let alone whom they were portrayed by. The very underrated Johnny Depp proves that he's a worthy actor who'll be willing to do anything for whatever roll that strikes his taste, as this one had following his approbation upon Thompson's inspirational book, which also had an affect onto Benicio Del Toro, who, when gaining that much weight for a roll, you know he's committed.
