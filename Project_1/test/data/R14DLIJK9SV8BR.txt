Its strength lies in its presentation of a vivid and robust picture of the work of Christ.  Its (the book, not the model) weakness is its simplistic reductions of other theologians' thoughts.Overview:The Christus Victor model presents the work of Christ as a triumph over the devil, powers (demons), bondage of sin, and the "law."  Accordingly, given its Eastern overtones, the atonement and the Incarnation are inseperable.  Christ united humanity to his nature to redeem it.  He redeemed it (still united to his nature) on the cross.This is to be contrasted with the Latin views of the atonement, which are narrowly penal.  The Latin views incorporate merit and penance in the atonment model.  For Aulen, this move removes the work of God from the work of Christ in redemption.Criticisms of the work:This is why I give it 4 stars.  I do not think he dealt as fairly with St Anselm as he could have.  David Bentley Hart (*Beauty of the Infinite*) has shown how St Anselm and St Athanasius do not fundamentally disagree.  Another problem I had is that biblical students need to see that the Bible incorporates all 3 models of the atonement (Mark 10 = substitutionary; Colossians 2:15 = Christus Victor; Peter 2:21 = exemplary). Aulen also used language that begged the question in favor of his position.Aside from the above criticisms, this is a paradigm-shifting book.
