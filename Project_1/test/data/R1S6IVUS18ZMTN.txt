This book is a prequel to the main series and it is focused on one series of events that helps establish the basis for the series as a whole.This prequel (there are rumors of two more) starts at the time of the Aiel war and introduces us to two of the most interesting characters in the series: Moiraine and Lan. It is basically the story of how these two people met and started off on their search for the Dragon Reborn. While that is the main focus of the book, there are many other characters and events that are hinted at in the series that are fleshed out and explained in this book. Surprisingly for Robert Jordan, this is a short book - only 340 pages or so. Also surprisingly, it is a complete story. It does not bounce around to the dozens of other people, nor does it terminate with nothing resolved. It starts by introducing us to Lan as the great warrior that he is; to Moiraine as a goofy and high-spirited Accepted and goes through the events in their lives that introduce them, bind them, and launch them on the search.Moiraine and Lan are the two most appealing characters to me in the Wheel of Time series and having this prequel fill in some of their earlier lives was a very enjoyable read to me. So, from those points of view, I really applaud this book.Jordan, being Jordan, however, could not resist the temptation to throw in all kinds of extra baggage. Many of the characters or institutions of the later books come into play here. We are introduced to Cadsuane, Siuan Sanche, the Black Ajah, Darkfriends, Trollocs etc. There are many areas that answer questions like what is the test for raising one from Accepted to full Sister? etc. On the other hand, there are many things that were brought up that were not really germane. For instance, is it really important to know that Siuan and Moiraine were lesbian lovers while being Accepted?My summary is that you should read this book as the first one and your introduction to the series if you have not started it yet, or if you are already a fan, then use it to add to your bakground knowledge.
