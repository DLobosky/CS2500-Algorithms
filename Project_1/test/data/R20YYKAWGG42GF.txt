Reading is good, but when it comes to material like this, audio is the way to go.  Sedaris' deadpan delivery is priceless. Seven of the stories in this collection are recorded live. These stories are among the best in the collection, and they are enhanced further by the live audience (those pregnant pauses, the anticipation, and the delirious laughter that follows each punch-line). Sedaris' stories (or essays, as they are often referred to) are amusing, real-life, anecdotes about the mundane. These are the stories told by the funniest guy at a dinner party. As with any collection of essays, some are better than others.  This collection gets off to a strong start with Go Carolina.  Many of the standout stories are the ones that were recorded live, in particular The Youth in Asia, I'll Eat What He's Wearing, and See You Again Yesterday.   Other stand-outs include: Shiner Like a Diamond and Learning Curve.In Canada we have a popular story-teller named Stuart McLean who is probably unknown outside the Great White North (we also like hockey and drink coffee at a place called Tim Horton's). David Sedaris is similar to McLean in that he tells amusing anecdotes'; however there is a distinct difference. McLean is strictly G rated entertainment; sentimental and charming. Sedaris, while not R rated, is delivering PG material. Readers and listeners should be prepared for coarse language, sexual content, and references to recreational drug use.  He speaks openly about his drug abuse and his homosexuality, which may be off-putting to some. And his humor is extremely caustic - and that may not appeal to everyone. (I on the otherhand, appreciate caustic humor)All in all, this is a highly entertaining collection of stories. Overall, I found the variety and quality of stories told in When You Are Engulfed in Flames to be a little better, but Me Talk Pretty One Day makes for enjoyable reading and/or listening.  There are moments that are almost certain to have you laughing out loud.
