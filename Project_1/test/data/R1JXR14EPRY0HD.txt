First I need to start off by saying that I am a big fan of the Asterix series. And I found these stories very entertaining. Though first published in English in 2003. This set of stories was originally published in French in 1996. And was a huge success.The book contains fourteen tales, including: The day Asterix and Oblix were born; How Oblix goes back to school; Fashion in Ancient Gaul; How Dogmatix helps the village cockerel win a duel; How Dogmatix is adopted as a Roman mascot; Asterix as you have never seen him before; Obelix's adventures under the mistletoe; The bid for the first Gaulish Olympics; The story of the creation of Asterix; The family tree of Obelix; and much more. Pick up this fun and book.
