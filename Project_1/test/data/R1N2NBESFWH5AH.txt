This is only the second story by her that I've read (the first being in an upcoming anthology and loved the story) and lets just say the jury's still out on a verdict.  Will I read her again?  Probably, but I think I'll see what reviewers have to say first.This was a fun story don't get me wrong.  One man at a house party filled with...lets's just say rather different women, one being our "heroine" and you have the makings for a fun story.  Problem though is there is not just one story within these pages...there are several. Three to be exact. Three stories with three sets of characters that have been building from past books.  What this means to me is that this is not a "stand alone read."  In other words you should probably pick up the other titles before attempting this one. As a result this reader was spending most of her time trying to piece together things that would have been clear to faithful fans.  This was distracting and took away from the fun of the read.Overall Ms. James has penned a rather unique read that fan's of historical romance can enjoy.  She thought a little out side the box and for readers that have issues with this...well, you should keep this in mind.  I have no troubles trying to catch up when reading a series out of order (I do it all the time) but this time it bothered me.  Perhaps because I truly felt as if I was missing something.  Ms. James is not an author that I would write off but she is a author that I will be careful about before jumping right in a buying one of her books.  Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com
