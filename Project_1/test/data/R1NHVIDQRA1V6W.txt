I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly doubtful considering the time  frame of the entire series from book one) she is being aided by a  ghostwriter. There is no possible way that this book could have been  written by the same author who was writing the series five years ago. Very  boring and cluttered with detail. Those of us who have come to know  &quot;Qwill&quot; and his two cats feel a great loss within the pages of  this book- their personality, humor, and warmth. The cats became merely  grunting pets in this book- and that's the &quot;clue&quot; that Ms. Braun  has passed on her pen. How truly sad :(
