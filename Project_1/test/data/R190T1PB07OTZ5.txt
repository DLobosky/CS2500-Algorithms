There isn't really much to say about a box set devoted to Colourbox. After all, Colourbox had a fairly short lifespan and did not release tons and tons of material.If you're already a fan, you'll want to pick up a copy. Only 2,000 were made and this set is pretty much the only way to get every single, album, and EP track Colourbox released. There's also a nice helping of live BBC sessions (be sure to check out the hilarious cover of Low Rider). As well, 4AD/Beggars Archive did a nice job on the remastering and graphic design of the box.New fans might be happier starting off with the compilation Best Of Colourbox 82/87. Not only does it include "Pump Up the Volume" (even though it's technically a collaboration under the M/A/R/R/S moniker), it's a better entry point than this gloriously obsessive box set.Bottom line: a great acquisition for committed fans and completists but probably overkill for others.
