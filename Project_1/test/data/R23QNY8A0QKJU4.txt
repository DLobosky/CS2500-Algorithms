I my review of the first in this fantasy series I said it was an adult fantasy, rich with human emotions not just a wonderful fantasy story.  ROYAL ASSASSIN confirms these observations, a tremendous fantasy world, story line and great human emotions story. The second book sees young FitzChivalry mature and become an more trusted friend to the Farseers, except Regal.  This second book has more action and enriches the characters, Molly, King Shrewd, Kettricken, Verity, and Burrich, and who could leave out Nighteyes.  This is a wonderful series and I look forward to the third book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
