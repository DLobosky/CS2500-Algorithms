We have 4 DVD sets and a few VHS's. If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)One of our most recent purchases was Bugs, Bugs, Bugs! and it's excellent as always. These three episodes are: *In a Beehive - Exploring bee behavior and a beehive*Gets Ants in Its Pants - Learning about the industrial world of ants*Butterfly and the Bog Beast - Metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterflyThere is also a few bonus features:*Bug Challenges*Find the Camouflage Butterflies*Ant OlympicsThis CD runs about 82 minutes and is supposedly geared towards children 3-8. Personally, I think the age-appropriate range is more like 6-10 because of the complex concepts introduced. However, if younger kids enjoy it--more power to them! It certainly can't hurt to introduce science to younger kids if the Magic School Bus holds their interest. My 8-year old son really enjoys the series now (he didn't get into it when he was younger), so I use the Magic School Bus series to supplement our learning/experimenting with science principles.
