I was quite satisfied with this, even though the cords are non-replaceable and the display is not lighted, until I discovered that the batteries (4xAA) even alkalines only last a couple of months and when they die, the phone goes dead too. That's not acceptable, and it makes for a very expensive phone in the long run.  I'm returning the one I still can return.
