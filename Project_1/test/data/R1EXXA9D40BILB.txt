Need Your Love So Bad (Version #2, Take 4)2. Rambling Pony3. I Believe My Time Ain't Long4. The Sun Is Shining5. Albatross6. Black Magic Woman7. Jigsaw Puzzle Blues8. Like Crying9. Need Your Love So Bad (Version #1, Take 1,2 & 3)10.Need Your Love So Bad (Version #2, Take 1 & 2)11.Need Your Love So Bad (Version #2, Take 3)12.Need Your Love So Bad (USA Version)This extraordinarily makes one song take up almost 2/3 of the entire album length!  Fortunately I'm a great Peter Green fan and so I'm not too bothered although I have to admit that even I got a little tired by the time I got to track 11 but thankfully the best version of "Need Your Love So Bad" is the last one saving the best for the end.  Fans and especially blues guitarists like myself will find this album a treat just listening to all the different soloing ideas, blues cliches, great vibrato techniques that Green executes throughout all the different versions of the tune; very instructional indeed.  Interspersed throughout the album are audio spoken outtakes among the band that are a treat and amusing for fans but may be irritating for others.  I was also happy with this album though because I wanted remastered versions of my 3 favourite old Fleetwood Mac tracks and they are all here in good sound quality as well : "Albatross", "Black Magic Woman" and "Jigsaw Puzzle Blues".  I'm a Santana and especially an "Abraxas" fan but I have to say that I like the original Peter Green version here better although I have to admit that although melodically both solos are similar I find Santana's version a little more original and more signature Carlos as Peter, great guitarist as he is, borrows heavily from the ideas of the late great Albert King especially when he executes the long exaggerated bends that work very well with this tune.  This is similar to what Stevie Ray Vaughan does with his "Let's Dance" solo for David Bowie; listen to both solos and you'll hear the great Albert King tribute by both guitarists albeit years and albums apart.  Another example of King's bending and vibrato style can be heard on Clapton's work on his "Strange Brew" solo during his Cream days."Jigsaw Puzzle Blues" is also a great and interesting track for blues guitarists because it sounds more like a jazz piece with its unusual time signature than a straight up blues piece and is brilliantly executed by composer Kirwan who is an excellent guitarist in his own right.As for the mlps design itself it isn't too much to shout about but I suppose I've seen worse.  An insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese is also included.  The sound quality overall is good for a late 60s/early 70s recording and is certainly better than the previous unremastered versions.Overall I'm pretty happy with this purchase although it is not the original track listing of the original release.  In fact, the track listing on the mlps cover itself is identical to the one Amazon puts out here although it is totally different from the actual content.  A great way to listen to a blues genius, Green, again whose excellent playing and singing voices fills me with a bit of sadness wondering what might have been had he been able to stay away from the booze and drugs that prematurely ruined what was a truly promising career.
