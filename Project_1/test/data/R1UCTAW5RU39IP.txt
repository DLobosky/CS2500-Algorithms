Most put together fairly easily, for example the tractor/truck puzzle would be a little easier for a beginner to put together that the planet puzzle, but these are very high interest puzzles for the 3 and 4 year olds.  The outline of the puzzle shape is marked on the puzzle board helping a little with the assembly of the puzzle.They go by the name "puzzlepatch picture puzzles"They are a nice size for sitting at a table and working on.
