The first time I saw this movie I was really moved by it. It seemed the kind of thing I wish I had written as a story, or the kind of movie I would like to make. After reading the reviews, most of which were negative, I  almost wondered if I had seen a different movie. Yes, there were flaws.  Perhaps, many, and reference to a Michael Jackson look-a-like might apply  in some eyes. However, what I saw was a view of the best and worst of  humanity. Yes, it has been done before and perhaps better. But I felt it  was one of the few times when science and religion were tied to a common  ground. Many laughed at this movie, especially the end and I wonder why,  unless I am wrong in it's overall interpretation. To me, what it was  saying is that humanity is special in that we can know that we are part of  everything around us, and all is part of us. We can most of all touch each  other in powerful life giving ways. To feel each others pain, and even the  pain of everything around us that lives.  To me the ending was a  self-sacrifice. He was giving, in a special way, his energy, love and  understanding, which was the best part of himself, to the universe and to  others. He knew that he was going to be limited in living a free life.  People would not ever leave him alone, and he could never be alone again,  now that he had been out in society. Some have said that the other  characters in the movie were overdone. Perhaps, they were just  uncomfortable at seeing parts of themselves. Having been a victim of  prejudice and hatred myself, I have lived among some of these people, and  some of them are as close as next door to me, and I do not see anything  overdone about them at all. Mankind can be very cruel. Killing is cruel  when it is done for the pure sport of it. Unlike many others, I found that  scene very powerful when the boy passes the pain of a dying animal, who is  dying for no reason other than man's pleasure, on to the man who shot him.  The movie might have failed in many ways to make some of the points it  tried to make. Some of the scenes were not well done, but overall it was a  movie to ponder and to make us think, and a mirror for the best and worst  of ourselves. The characters were all of us. I believe that we are energy  and light, and goodness and darkness. But  in giving to each other and  loving each other, we can tap into our full humanity. That is what the  movie said to me. We are capable of so much, and life, the universe and  ourselves are so sacred.  Sorry folks, I agree it was not a perfect  movie, but open your eyes. Neither are we, yet look at our recent around  the world celebration of 2000. We should be proud that it went without  incident all over the world. We deserved it after much of the pain and  torture of this past century. To me,  this movie was saying that the human  spirit is about peace, love, energy and light, and it is a gift we can  daily give to others, but some are too closed to see it, and for some their  pain is too great. We need to reach out to others, loving them and  ourselves more. This movie was about loving. Not perfect, but then  neither are we.
