Though the film seems to be a bit tame now, it was quite daring at the time and criticism of the film ruined Michael Powell's career.  Powell took a chance in making a movie about a serial killer and paid for bringing up the topic.  The film made in 1962 was disturbing to viewers and partly because Powell wasn't known for making horror films he was rejected in a way that Hitchcock got away with.  A young man abused and tormented by his filmmaker father apparently created a monster of greater proportions.  The man is a cameraman for a movie studio and a photographer of pornographic pictures.  He uses a weapon in his tripod to murder women.  The story centers around the psychological makeup of the young man and the discovery of his murders by the police and his neighbors.  The reaction by the British critics caused Michael Powell's career to be derailed and criticized for years.  They generally considered it to be unworthy of British Cinema and an impolite topic to have been brought to the screen.  The extras are very insightful and well worth viewing and listening to.
