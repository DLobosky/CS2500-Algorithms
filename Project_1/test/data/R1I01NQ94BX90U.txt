Color:  Not that most people will care that much about the colors, but the blue is so much brighter and shinier than in the picture!Sound Quality:  The sound is great. (Note: I am poor and have to buy cheap headphones, so when I say great, I mean 'great for cheap headphones.'  If you are a headphone aficionado who isn't on such a strict budget, these are not for you.)  I can hear words very clearly.Isolation:  These headphones remove unnecessary background noise, but not all, which is exactly what I like.  They block out the sound of the bus when I am riding in it, as well as the rumbling of everyday traffic (Not next to a busy freeway, though.)Comfort: If the earbuds were a bit smaller, I could sleep on my side in them and never notice them.  One of the best benefits of Coby earbuds is the changeable ear bud covers that are soft and comfortable.  They stay snugly in the ear, but don't pop out painfully when tugged too hard.Durability:  These seem a lot more delicate than I'm used to, so I am being a lot more careful with them than normal headphones.  That may make them last longer.  Not sure.  The ear buds appear to be connected to the cord with a flexible silicone cover instead of the usual hard connection that tends to break over time.The part that goes into the headphone jack is a hard plastic tube with cord protected inside. Be careful not to yank on it!Thankfully the headphones are easy to keep safely stowed in the classy velvet bag included.  I don't know why the creators of these headphones thought a velvet bag was necessary, but now I'm going to be disappointed if my next pair doesn't come with one.(This review will be updated when the headphones break.)
