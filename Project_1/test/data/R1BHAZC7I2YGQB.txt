Reminds me of Nestle's Quik when I was growing up...After the third day, I had a whole day of explosive foul-smelling rotten-egg flatulence that could only be attributed to the drink I had. However, I wonder if this happened because I had added 8 oz of skim milk to the drink... usually I do not have a problem with skim milk as I have it in coffee and with cereal during the day.The rotten-egg smell, per my research, comes from sulfur-containing foods... perhaps the combination of hemp and milk creates a nondigestible mix?Please, if anyone has ideas feel free to comment.
