Though a thin volume, this commentary on Romans is still packed with solid, doctrinally sound, exegesis.   Of course, it is difficult to review any in this series without thinking also of the Navarre series volume, The Navarre Bible: Romans and Galatians (The Navarre Bible: New Testament). The strength of the Ignatius commentary is it's broader overview word studies and outlines in addition to it's clarity. The strength of the Navarre commentary is in the introductory section - and the Navarre volume contains Galations and Romans together which seems to be a good fit as these two epistles overlap in so much of Paul's theology.  The Navarre Bible also includes the parallel Latin vulgate not included in the Ignatius Bible.  For the Ignatius commentary, you would need two volumes to get both Romans and Galations studies.Having both the Navarre and Ignatius commentaries would be ideal for study and it is highly recommended to use both in preparation for teaching.  However, if your budget allows only one or personal study is your sole purpose, the Ignatius study is the one to choose even if it requires obtaining the second volume for the epistle to the Galations.
