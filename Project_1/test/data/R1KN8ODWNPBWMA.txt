It is a rewrite and expansion of the author's more basic memoirs entitled "Into the Flames."This new version is written for teenagers, but retains enough sophistication for adults to enjoy it as well.The book follows the author's adventures and travails as her country, Poland, is invaded first by the Germans and then, to her horror, the Russians as well.  At the time she is a a 17 year old maiden, student nurse, and practicing Catholic.  She falls in with the Polish armed forces, whose leadership flees the country, leaving everyone else to fend for themselves.  Fiercely nationalist, she joins the Polish underground and takes up arms to defend her country.A Russian patrol, however, finds her shortly thereafter.  The Russsians rape her repeatedly, beat her unconscious, and leave her to die alone in the snow.  Fortunately, she is discovered and taken to a hospital.  As she recuperates loudspeakers in the town blare out a constant announcement of how lucky the Poles are that Mother Russia has saved them from themselves.  Eventually, she ends up in German occupied Poland and begins working for a German Major.  She discovers that the Nazis are mistreating the Jewish people, keeping them enclosed in ghettos or killing them outright.  She first tries to help the Jewish people by sneaking small portions of food into the ghetto.  Then she helps hide some Jews in a forest outside town.  Next she ends up hiding a dozen Jews in the basement of the Major's house. The Major finds out about it.  His price to keep quiet is that the author become his mistress.  She agrees.  She goes to her priest to seek absolution.  The priest tells her he cannot absolve her even though she is only sleeping with the Major to save the lives of these Jews.  The priest's explanation is that they are, after all, only Jews. But she does not give up and does not betray those she has promised to save.  After the Germans begin to evacuate Poland, she escapes from the Major and rejoins the Polish underground.  After the war, the Soviets arrest her as a partisan leader.  She escapes again and makes her way to America.Her story is a remarkable one of courage, resilience, and faith.
