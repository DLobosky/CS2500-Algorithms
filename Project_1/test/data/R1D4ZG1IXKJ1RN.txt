Jones series and it's full of holiday cheer.It's the holiday / Christmas season for Junie B. and her friends and classmates. Her class has been chosen to wear jingle-bell hats and perform carols. Only here's the thing --- May's spying and peeping and tattle-taling threatens to ruin it all for Junie B. Jones, or as May calls her, just Junie Jones. Things get even "worser" for Junie B. when she's chosen to be May's Secret Santa. Junie B. has a plan for a gift that will really spite May, but as she sees May's joy at the holiday season, she begins to wonder about her plan.This is a great book that shows the true spirit of the season. Readers will feel what Junie B. feels as the events unfold. and the ending is very satisfying.The only thing I miss about the newer books is the letter from Barbara Park at the end. This was always a nice touch and it feels like a small something is missing for it not to be there.
