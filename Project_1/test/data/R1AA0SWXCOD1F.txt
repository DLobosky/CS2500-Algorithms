At the end of the day it works fine, but getting it to do what you need it to is a chore...over and over.Cons:1. On DVDs you cannot select the main DVD menu when the previews are playing. You have to push the skip button X times to get through the previews until you finally get to the menu. Such a pain. The navigating directly to the menu works just find for Blu-ray, just not for DVD.2. Slow, slow, slow. Navigating through the software is soooo slow. Whether Netflix or just getting to the Vierracast menu, it is just so slow. My old Roku box seems blistering fast compared to this. A firmware update made things even slower. 3. Interface in not intuitive. For example, you can't push the big green centrally placed Vierra Cast button when in Netflix or watching a DVD. Nothing happens. You have to push the less prominent "Home" button off to the right to get out of Netflix and then push the Vierra Cast button. Why?!4. The optical drive is noisy and annoying. I still kept my old DVD play to play CDs (old school, I know) because I can't stand the Blu-ray drive humming when I am listening to music. I find the hum disturbing even when I am watching DVDs.Pros1. Dedicated Netflix button. Cuts out some navigation.Recommendation:This Panasonic works fine for Blu-rays, but don't expect it do be a great all-in-one device. Get a Roku and keep your old DVD player. They will both work much better than this thing. Roku is snappier and the software is updated more frequently with the latest and greatest.  Your old DVD player will be easier to use.
