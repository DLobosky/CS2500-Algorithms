My guess is the action buffs would call this movie a chick flick because of the lack of violence and focus on emotional development. I pity you poor slobs for being so narrow minded. Bicentennial Man is like an autobiography. With that in mind the movie makes perfect sense and achieves what it sets out to do. First lets get to the sci-fi stuff. The movie is supposed to open in the year 2005, which is roughly five years after the movie was made. No idea why they decided on just a short time. Obviously we never developed positronic brains and fully self-capable robots, but that's just nit picking. Add a couple of decades to the movie's timeline and all is well. The android technology was well done and believable. Also the 'upgrades' that Andrew (the android) does during his lifetime tend to be believable as well. Not much other tech stuff in the movie. You'll see a hover car here and some fancy tools there, but for the most part the technology in this movie is focused on the androids.Because the movie's timeline covers about 200 years (thus the movie title) character development for the humans have been sped up, but not to the point to where you don't see it. There are a few one dimensional or static characters in the movie. The important characters fortunately aren't. Bicentennial Man is about character development by the way. It's about how Andrew becomes more and more human and how the humans around him adjust to how much he evolves. The acting was well done of course. I have to give notice to child actress Hallie Kate Eisenberg for doing a great job as the youngest of the Martin family children. The movie is full of beautiful scenes both natural and technological. One thing that bugged me was there were some breathtaking futuristic cityscapes in Bicentennial Man, but they don't show any of them until much later in the movie. That tends to make the movie unbalanced as far as imagery is concerned. If you like dramas then Bicentennial Man will hit the spot. If you like epics then you should be able to get something out of this movie too. It also makes a good date movie since it also involves love and relationships and all that mushy stuff. For the average science fiction fan as long as you're not all freaky about things having to blow up or anything like that then you too will enjoy Bicentennial Man.
