I have loved the gran turismo series ever since the first one came out(ps one). They were, in my opinion, always the best/most realistic racing sim out there...that is until Forza! This game is simply beautiful and it's gonna sell a TON. According to a review in gamepro, "easily the best driving game ever made". XBOX Live too, sweet! Along w/ the Halo & Splinter Cell series this game is a must buy for ALL xbox owners. Forza will rock your ass, kid. To quote the fast & the furious..."Smoke 'em !!!"
