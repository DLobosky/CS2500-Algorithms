The 3 way match for the Hardcore title was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Woman's title match between Sable & Tori. The World tag team title match between the team of Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart against the team of D-Lo Brown & Test was short but sweet. The Brawl For All boxing match between Butterbean & Bart Gunn was crud to the 10th power. The Mankind-Big Show match was so-so with a cruddy ending. The 4 corners elimination match for the IC title was pretty good for a 4 corners match. The HHH-Kane match was a hard-hitting brawl with a lousy DQ ending. The European title match between Shane McMahon & X-Pac was a fun & entertaining bout with a twist that you have to see to belive. The Hell In A Cell match between The Undertaker & The Big Boss Man was a sloppy but solid brawl. The No-DQ match for the World title between The Rock & Steve Austin was a fun,entertaining,hard-hitting,hardcore streetfight. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.
