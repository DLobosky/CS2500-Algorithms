The base includes one shelf, so you can use it for a low-level single unit if you like.  You can also substitute reduced height or extended height pillars to adjust the spacing.The base is a heavy-gauge U-shaped steel tube, with inserts in the ends and short pillars to support the first shelf above it.  The pillars are secured with machine screws from underneath the shelf. The ends of the steel tubing are rolled and have plastic inserts, and the finish is a textured hard enamel.  Two sets of feet are provided: nylon slides for most users and steel spikes for those who want to minimize vibration.The shelf itself is very well made.  MDF, but high density and the surfacing and edges as very, very solid.  Not the junk that looks like contact paper which Sauder and others use.  Each shelf has a good-sized hole in the back to route wiring and keep everything looking neat.The pillars are heavy gauge steel, with welded inserts about 1/8" thick to accept the threaded studs that hold them together.  I think the studs must be a metric size--they're thicker than a 10-24 but thinner than a 1/4-20.  About 4 mm thick, I'd guess.  The ends of the steel tubing are rolled to keep from scratching the shelf, and the finish is a textured hard enamel.Assembly is a snap.  Once you've put the base together, you just add studs in the ends of the pillars, drop the shelf on, and screw on the next set of pillars.  At the top, you use the pan-head allen machine screws instead of the studs.Only downside is that the satin finish on the shelves can show fingerprints.  However, they do wipe off easily.
