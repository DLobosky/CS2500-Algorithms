I bought from Amazon a SONY BRAVIA XBR55HX929 55-Inch 1080p 3D Local-Dimming LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black. Indeed, this is one fantastic HDTV. (See my review.)However, the speakers are just OK; they are not powerful. So, we added (from Amazon) a  SONY HTCT550W 3D Soundbar Home Theater System with Wireless Subwoofer and mounted the Soundbar component with a Soundbar Brackets Universal Soundbar Bracket (from Amazon). Although only 3 inches high, we mounted the SONY Soundbar on the top of the TV (TV on its stand on a table) because the Soundbar  blocked all of the remote control features on the bottom of the TV. In the end, though, the SONY Soundbar on this Bracket is worth the money. There are a few provisos, however.At first we just put both the Soundbar (facing either frontwards or towards the ceiling) and the Sub-Woofer just behind the TV and it sounded remarkably good! But, we decided to do it right and mount the Soundbar on top of the TV with the Bracket and placed the Woofer behind the TV and that sounded even better...quite good, in fact. However, the Soundbar Brackets Universal Soundbar Bracket is difficult to set up so that it is rigidly stable. The story is as follows.Although some reviews and the instructional videos that the Bracket Manufacturer provides make Soundbar Installation seem like a one minute affair; we don't agree. We believe that this installation is, in fact, not for the faint of heart! If you are used to building cars or motorcycles it is fine...But, just know that two screws on each side of the TV's back (total of 4) are required in addition to the two notch screws on the Soundbar (total of 6) for the whole installation to be stable. This is NOT what the Manufacturer says...They claim that all you need is one screw on each side of the TV's back in addition to the two notch screws on the Soundbar for the whole thing to be stable.Our SONY Soundbar weighs only ~6 pounds and is only 3 inches high, much less than larger (e.g.; Yamaha) Soundbars which are significantly heavier. Even with the two 2-inch wide 1/8" thick steel (nicely powder-coated) Brackets only two of our (SONY) screws on the back of our TV matched the Brackets long slots and these could NOT be tightened enough to hold our relatively light Soundbar on the top of our TV from moving side-to-side.  Unfortunately, due to the "J" curve of the Brackets (and its long slots) did not match the positions of all 4 of the screws/screw holes on the back of our SONY.We did in fact get lucky and were able to make these Brackets work to mount our Soundbar on the top of our TV, however...  We placed each Bracket vertically, so that the hook of the "J" was down with the open side of the "J" facing each another. We then overlapped the bottom of each hook of the "J"s by about 2.5 inches.  This allowed us to catch the bottom outside corner of each "J" with the (only the edge of the bottom two SONY back screws, while the top two SONY screws fit correctly in the top third of the two Brackets "Slots". In addition, the two slot screws on the Soundbar were fitted to the Soundbar (total of 6). We were able to tighten the lower edge-clamping screws enough in combination with the top properly placed (in slots) screws (total of 4) to hold the bar from moving side-to-side.  But, the Soundbar does move front to back some due to the flexing of the two 2 inch bars. But, that's OK. We stabilized that movement of the Soundbar on the top of the TV with simply a 10 inch band of packing tape on the back of the TV where it meets the Soundbar.We highly recommend laying your HDTV face-down on a clean blanket or bed spread. Do not try to fit these Brackets like demonstrated by the Bracket's Manufacturer with the TV vertical. Assembly, may or may not work depending on where the screw holes are on your HDTV and you will need to experiment. Be safe and do this with your TV's back horizontal like a table.  Good Luck!  Amazon is great...You can always send them back!
