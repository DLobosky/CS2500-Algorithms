 Next to those two kind of people you have the people that don't know what to think of it yet cause they haven't danced that much in their lives. To those people, who want to see what dancing is about or if you want to be shown what dancing can do to a human being: watch this film.
 
 Shall We Dance tells the story of John Clark, a man who takes care of people's wills for a living. He has a nice family and is happy with them, but still, something inside him doesn't feel happy. He misses something. He finally decides to take a look in a dancing school, where he starts following lessons in secret and gets his life changed.
 
 Shall We Dance is a great feelgood film that gives a nice warm feeling. First of all, the film has fantastic actors that give fine acting performances. Richard Gere portrais his character in the exact right way. He lets the character show how he feels in situations very clearly and does that realistically with a whole lot of fun. He is charming and does a fine job as the leading role.
 Next to Gere, there is Jennifer Lopez. If somebody is criticised on her acting skills a lot, it is Lopez. But don't you worry, Lopez does a fantastic job and is part of the feelgood factor. She acts warm, nice and shows the character's emotions in a succesfull way. Well done.
 The rest of the cast is one big fun group. Susan Sarandon is perfectly choisen as John's wife and does the part with good acting. The film has hilarious supporting roles from Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Miller and Anita Gillette who all bring the film to a level of great comedy and romantic fun.
 
 Technically the film looks professional and perfectly fine. The dancing has been well shot and captured on camera. The editing and the lifting music together sure makes the film swing nicely. The lighting is great, the sets are fun and colorfull to see and the music is on the right track. All these elements together give the film a nice atmosphere that gives you, as the audience, a nice feeling inside. Thats what makes this film powerful in a way: the warm Atmosphere.
 The comedy is hilarious at some points and the film has some nice jokes. The story may be a bit obvious and predictable, it still is a lot of fun for a night of movie entertainment. Romantic, funny, swinging, even a little drama here and there gives it a nice human touch.
 A succesful film that lightens up one's spirit and leaves you with a nice big smile on your face.
 
 If you love dancing this film is an absolute must see for you. If you love romantic comedies, I would also recommend you this film.
 If you don't like dancing at all but you love the feeling you get from the movies and the vibe it gives you: just take a look, give it a try and who knows? Maybe you will be linening up in a dancing school only a few days later...
 "Shall we Dance?"
 "I'd love to!"
 Enjoy and most importantly: have fun watching this film!
