I also bought The Ultimate Wave: Tahiti (IMAX) [Blu-ray 3D] and will review that separately.My reasons for buying short IMax 3D movies were several. For one, I wanted a short movie that offered great instant real shot 3D without gimmicks. I didn't want fake 3D like the Clash of the Titans or Alice in Wonderland movies, and I didn't want lengthy movies with slash cuts and noise. I wanted something serene to demonstrate the set up. Secondly and more importantly, I also wanted to use it to allow me to take the time to tweak everything to perfection so I have the best 3D image I can. To that end this movie is almost perfect. Some of the shots are truly breath-taking, but interestingly enough the high up vista shots of fluffy clouds and flowing mountain ranges offer less fascinating 3D, at least to me, than the tight shots of mechanical bearings, wheel wells and instrument panels. There's an opening shot at the beginning of the movie panning into the cockpit of a stationary plane and it is truly the most stunning 3D I've ever seen.Sadly, there are many wireframe 3D animations in this movie many of which seem to fail to carry off any sense of depth at all. In the Ultimate Wave movie the animations have a backdrop to allow you eyes to know the depth of the objects to the forefront. The animations in Legends however are against black and just really work pooly. I also was saddened to see the CGI planes overlaid onto the aerial footage. It's well done and I understand that getting the shots they have would be dangerous if not impossible... but it's still obviously computer generated. Some shots also had no 3D in it at all. I had to check to see if my glasses had desynced! There's only a couple though.The content itself is a corporate video for Boeing. It contains lots of lauding of the company itself and clearly was made under strict supervision. I'm not sure that's too awful... I mean they're not claiming Boeing cured cancer or anything, and the movie does go into detail of some failure for the company. Does anyone buy this for the actual narrative though?With all that said, you have an amazing experience here worthy of your 3D collection. At the price point it's a no brainer.
