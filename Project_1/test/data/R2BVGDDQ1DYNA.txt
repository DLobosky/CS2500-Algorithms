Our baby hit the wall of colic at 3 weeks and continued through 5 months screaming for more than 8 hours a day.  At 4 months I found this DVD and Mozart and read the reviews here where people said their infants were mezmerized.  I bought both.  At the beginning she liked Mozart better.  But by 5 months she preferred Shakespeare because of all the silly puppets and their noises.  She Loves the Train poem, and the tiger in the grass and Bard when he plays in the colorful leaves.  She will kick her arms and legs and squeal when she sees these 3 scenes. She is now 5.5 months and her head turns to the TV when she hears the opening music or Julie's voice.  She cries now when she hears the ending music starting....
