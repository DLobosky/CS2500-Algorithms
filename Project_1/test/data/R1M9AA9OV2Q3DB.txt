Questions that Apple staff in the local Apple store were unable to answer to my satisfaction are amply covered in this book. While the first section on fundamentals of digital photography is more basic than I need, still I got some useful information out of that section. I gained an understanding of the workings of the iPhoto image files - original and modified - and on how iPhoto interfaces with Elements 6.0. I also bought the Missing Manual for Elements 6.0 and find the two albums play well together.Things that I previously was unable to figure out became clear within a short time thanks to the Missing Manual for iPhoto '08.  I feel more confident that I am going to master the photo processing software and spend much less time at the iMac while doing a better job of editing and printing my images. A great value because it translates right into time saved.  Much easier than using on line help and tutorials because the manual asks the questions that I was unable to even think to ask - and then proceeds to answer the questions. I am very pleased with this book. I have over 15,000 images in iPhoto now and feel that I will soon be in command of the images and not the other way around.
