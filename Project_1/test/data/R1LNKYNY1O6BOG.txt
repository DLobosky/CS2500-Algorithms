It is humor done by a group who are far less raunchy than most of their counterparts.  In spite of that, there are some parts that are a bit risque.  Many parents may not be comfortable with having younger children view this as there are some jokes that are provocative.Although it is good, and I had quite a few good laughs with it, I would recommend that parents preview it before allowing kids to watch it.
