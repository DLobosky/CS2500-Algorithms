I thought this would play on my 3D TV with my 3D blue ray player.  The 3 D version (DVD, not blue ray) does not play with a 3 D TV, it is only good on a regular TV.  I guess because my LG 3D TV does the conversion in the TV and this movie was made for a regular TV.  The price was good, so I will give it away to my Grandson. Shipping was fast and condition of the movies were good, just my mistake.  But I do now know you cannot play the old 3D movies made for the paper glasses.Continued:  I did send the DVD Polar Express movie to my Grandson.  I found this in true 3D, so just remember that you need to see the specifics of the  movie before you order.  This movie is great in 3D blue Ray version.  The effects are as I expected them to be, and I always loved the movie in regular 2D format.  I am just spoiled with my new 3D TV.  Used the Prime service and arrived as promised.  Condition of the movie was perfect.
