The Motion Picture had been out of print for quite a while, and I was wondering how and why Paramount would put that out of print, of course they released the Blu-Ray version of this set earlier, which I was kind of upset about because I don't have Blu-Ray, and I wanted these movies really bad on DVD, so a few months ago I bought Star Trek 'The Motion Picture' trilogy, but of course it only had 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home' and while I knew what movies it had with it, I was disappointed kind of, 'cause I wanted 'The Motion Picture' with it.Well, finally a few months later, they released the standard definition version, I was very pleased when I had found out they did, it was on the top of my list to get (along with 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection, which I bought a few weeks ago), and they did a great job with that one, so I knew this one would be just as good...and it is.You get all 6 motion pictures of course, as well as a bonus disc 'Captains Summit', which I have not watched yet, I will when I watch all the movies, of which 2 I hadn't seen before 'The Final Frontier' and 'The Undiscovered Country', and I watched them both last night, and I was very happy with them, I find 'The Final Frontier' to be very underrated, and 'The Undiscovered Country' was the perfect way to say goodbye (although in 'Generations' from 'The Next Generation' we saw Captain Kirk, Chekov, and Scotty one final time).As for 'The Motion Picture' I find this one to be criminally underrated, I think it is a great start for the movie series, I guess I saw more than most other people saw in it, and even after seeing it countless times in my teens, it just never gets old, great underrated movie.As for the trilogy part 'The Wrath of Khan' 'The Search for Spock' 'The Voyage Home', these were the most successful movies in the series, with good reason, it's just an awesome three part adventure, epic, full of action, great acting of course, and great stories, everything a Star Trek fan could ask for.I can never get enough of Star Trek...well, aside from 'Deep Space Nine' and 'Enterprise'.To me, Star Trek is and will always be 'The Original Series' 'The Next Generation' and 'Voyager'.Bottom line, fans, buy this set, it is well worth the price paid for it, it pays for itself, and if you buy this set (and like it), what Star Trek fan wouldn't? I suggest buying 'The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection' as well, as it's just as nice as this.Hope this review was helpful.
