I like alt rock but can't say generally that you would find the great playing or skill  of nonalt rock bands. like I said I like alt rock (but don't love it like nonalt rock)  and I like this cd because it is great alt rock. That being said they were on their way to being  a great nonalt band with the next cd which is better all around and remains one of the best cds to come out in the 80's.  This one is similiar to the more primitive southern death cult cd but better played and performed than that precult alt band. The song dreamtime' is as good as the anything the band put out later on too but most of it is more alt rock and if you don't at least like alt rock then you won't like this one as I like alt I think the cult did a great alt cd with this one.  However I would say that a great alt cd is less than a regular rock bands work in my enjoyment levels usually. so I would buy this one if you are a cult completist or at least enjoy alt rock .
