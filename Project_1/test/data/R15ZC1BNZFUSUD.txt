During their stay they stumble upon a secret and learn that some secrets can be beautiful.  Some secrets can change who you are forever.  I loved this book when I was nine, and I love this book today -- some twenty plus years later.  Read this book yourself, read it to your child, read it with your child.  It will become part of who you are.
