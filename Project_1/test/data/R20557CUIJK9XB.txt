This cat food is organic and full of good things for cats, but our cats will not eat it. They are used to pet guard cat foods, which is also organic, but Amazon was out so I ordered this as a substitute. Our younger female liked it ok, but our three older males just turned up their noses to it and refused to eat it. It does smell much better than other organic's, but that does't really matter if they won't eat it. If your cat will eat it, I'd say great product, but for us, it was a waste of money.
