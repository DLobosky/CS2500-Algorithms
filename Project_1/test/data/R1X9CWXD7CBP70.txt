I've never really been in shape in my life; I had low self-esteem all through my childhood and adolescence that left me severely out of shape. While I'm in a much better place now (married to a fantastic guy for three years and working my dream job), I'm still not quite where I want to be. My goal isn't to get a supermodel body, but to simply look good in whatever I want to wear and, more importantly, lead a long, healthy, happy life.I admit I was a bit worried about this DVD. It's got a reputation for being incredibly tough, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to do it. Certainly there were many times during the twenty minutes each level comprises that I wanted to keel over and die, but I did manage to complete Level One. Make no mistake, however; just because each level is only 20 minutes doesn't mean it's a walk in the park. If you can't or won't work out for hours a day (I certainly don't), then you need to expect the workouts you DO take part in to be hard and relentless. Otherwise, what's the point?An interesting addition to the routine is that Jillian's two backup girls both do modified versions of the exercises; one of them deliberately does slightly easier versions to show beginners how to get started without hurting themselves, while the other pushes each exercise to the limit with harder variations. Beginners will likely appreciate the instruction since the workout is so intense. Some exercises, however, have no modifications; as Jillian points out, for example, she has 400 pound people who can do a jumping jack, so so can you.Jillian is actually at her most aggressive in this DVD; whereas in No More Trouble Zones, for example, her tone is very light and chipper, she comes across more as though she means business here. She makes an important point that people are encouraged to be complacent, and told that just "taking the stairs" once in a while is enough. That's a good first step, but it's not going to change your lifestyle. I actually found it very inspiring, and each time I felt my energy flag, I forced through it. I'm only at Level One, and my first time through there were multiple times when I felt like I should just quit; the pace is fast and relentless, and less than halfway through my muscles were already trembling with exertion. I kept through, however, and finishing was incredibly satisfying, even if I could barely move after. Don't get me wrong; I'm nowhere NEAR ready for Level Two, let alone Level Three, but I'll get there.I cycle this DVD with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones for 5 days a week, and I'm definitely seeing results already. My husband doesn't "like" Jillian as far as her personality goes, but he adores her for what she's done for me; she's become a role model, and I've found a lot of motivation through her exercise routines that have brought about dramatic results. I'm on my way to being healthier and happier, and with some discipline, support from my husband, and Jillian's high-intensity workouts, I'm going to get there sooner rather than later.Best advice: Keep water nearby. You are going to SWEAT if you are doing this properly, and staying hydrated will do wonders for your stamina. I also recommend having something small to eat beforehand, like an apple or a banana, to help boost your energy. If you need to, as Jillian advises, take a five second breather . If you feel dizzy, or in pain, STOP. The DVD cannot read your mind, and it doesn't know what medical conditions you have, or what shape you're in, so it can't tell you if you're doing something wrong, or whether you should be doing a particular exercise based on your body's issues. Exercise common sense about your health, and don't feel silly about consulting your doctor if you need to. Take things slow, but don't be afraid to try, and you'll see results.
