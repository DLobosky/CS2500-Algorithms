The 16gb gives me approximately 4,400 12mp photos worth of storage, and almost 4 hours of video when used with my Kodak Z1285 Camera. The 8bg gave me 2 hours, and the 2gb about 35 minutes.  With the 16gb, 8gb and the 2gb card that came with my camera, I can take almost 7,000 photos without deleting any of them, or almost 7 hours of video !  The 16gb card from Transcend is great.. Any size is great, but the 16 for $30... is a real bargain for what it gives you.
