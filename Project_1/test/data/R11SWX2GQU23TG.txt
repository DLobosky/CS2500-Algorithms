George A Romero's Dawn of The Dead is without a doubt the definitive zombie film it is my favorite of the series.It has believable Characters with good personalities. The Zombkies are the most believable I have seen. The Gore Effects by Tom SAVINI are the  best he is the master of gore. Unlike the last one Night of the Living dead where it takes place in a house this movie takes place in a Shopping mall whats not to love about that? I like the fact that Romero didnt kill off all the cast like in the last film. I understand that people need too die in horror films but there has too be at least one surviver.This film gos one step further then the last film in terms of gore its pretty Believable. I was so impressed by it this film is so creepy and scary at times but I can relate too the cast with them trying too survive it all cause its basically Survival of the fitest in this film. if you dont watch  your back the zombies will get you!!!!!!!!This movie is such a rollercoaster ride I was intrigued by this film its one of my altime favorite horror films and one not too be missed.  This film is so unflinching in its realism its insane I love it.The perfect film too see with your buddies that like this genre.There are some Laughs too be had but for the most part George A Romero is pretty seriuos when it comes down too the Horror Genre. My favorite Part of this film was when the Zombies ate some of the biker Gang.The biker gang had it coming cause all they cared about in the mall was the things they didnt care about the people one bit.  Zombies come in all shapes and sizes in this film. I can imagine the amount of Controversy this movie must have had when it came out cause it just doesnt let up in terms of the Gore!!!!!! If you have a weak stomach this isnt the film for you but if you can  handle it this film is definately a must buy not a rental.At a little over 2 hours this film is the longest of Romero's Zombie films. This is a movie that I will watch untill the day I die its that good.Gearge Romero has definetely come a long way since he first started making movies and this film is definetly withoubt a doubt his best work yet.I found this movie too be Spectacular a must own.  The actors in this film were really good and did an exellent job portraying there characters I felt like this is something that was real because of how effective the gore effects of Tom Savini are that just shows that he knows how too make you question what you see. What more can i say other then this film is one for the masses of horror buffs every horror buff with the stomach for this movie and the patients to sit for at least 2 hours should go out right know and add this movie too there horror collection.
