The lighter-socket outlet will shut off if you exceed 5 amps of continuous draw, and the unit can only store a few "amp/hours" of power. If you need something for overnight use or to do much more than charging a cell phone, you might need a larger unit.It works fine for starting cars, though. This appears to be identical to the Vector VEC010BD, which sells under the Black and Decker label. B&D has more recognition, I've seen this one (the Vector brand) at some auto supply shops, as well as here on Amazon. So you get the same product, no matter what the label or where you get it.My neighbor had one of these, and I borrowed it several times to start my car, which was otherwise totally dead. It worked perfectly, even when the unit wasn't fully charged. So I bought my own, charged it overnight as per the instructions, three hours past the blinking green. (Note: the brief manual is very well written, and should be easy to follow.)For some reason my car would not start right up, as it had the other times with my neighbor's jump starter. The car turned over and over, but wouldn't kick in, and the effort drew down the jump starter's cranking power completely.The instructions tell you to wait a little when this happens, so I did. After a few minutes, I turned it back on, tried again, and the car started. I don't think it was a matter of a flooded engine, which one might suspect. Just a curious sort of process.I recharged the Vector unit completely again, and the next time I needed to jump the car, it was instantaneous. I performed multiple jumps without needing a new charge. So, I don't know whether there is anything special about the first time, because every other time I've used it, it has been great.If you do want it mostly for jump starts, and do not expect to need it as an "emergency power" source for long hours, or to run any kind of serious appliance, it is a fine choice.
