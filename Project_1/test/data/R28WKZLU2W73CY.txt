Susan Hayward was perfect for playing the tempestuous heroine headed for South Africa during the Boer Wars.  Tyrone Power, as always, cuts a dashing figure as Hayward's on-and-off love interest.  In fact, the whole thing comes off like a mini-version of GONE WITH THE WIND in Afrikaner territory.  A location shoot was done for the CinemaScope cameras, and the efficient Henry King, Fox's CinemaScope director of choice, was in charge.  The whole thing is overly episodic, but lavish, and it has the kind of dime-novel melodrama that would appeal to adolescent girls at the time.  It's sort of a boy's-own adventure for the ladies, and it succeeds on that level.  Along with the panoramic vistas, the fabulous score by Franz Waxman is the best thing about it.This Spanish DVD version presents the film with both an English and Spanish language option (with optional Spanish subtitles).  The film is presented widescreen (2:55 to 1), but, sadly, without anamorphic enhancement for 16:9 tv setups, and also without the original 4-track sterephonic sound.  Both the soundtracks are presented in monaural from the magnetic masters and sound adequate.  The picture quality on the disc is in good shape, albeit interlaced.  The disc is nicely slip-cased.  This is the only available widescreen dvd available as of 2010, so viewers will have to settle for it until Fox presents this film on dvd or blu-ray in the US.  Corporate interests have made most major studios adamant about releasing their classic film libraries in the USA, except in premium-priced, dvd-r versions - a disrespectful practice to say the least!
