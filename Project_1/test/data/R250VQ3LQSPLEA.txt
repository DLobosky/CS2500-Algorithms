I'm a former wrestling fan who watched from approximately 1998-2003 who grew to love the Pre-Attitude WWF matches from 1985-1997 and now only buys the occasional DVD to have a complete set of the Big Four PPVs or career sets for specific wrestlers or events. This is good for the classic fan because the whole events have never been released on DVD before. 1992 is most well known for a clash between old WWF and the new generation as in one match Mr. Perfect and Macho Man Randy Savage battle Ric Flair and Razor Ramon, while in the other main event New Champion Bret Hart battled Shawn Michaels in a preview of what was to come over the next few years. 1993 for me comes down to the opening tag match and the Family Feud Match that laid the stones for the feud of 1994 between Bret Hart and Owen Hart. 1994 was once again fronted by a good opening match, a casket match between Undertaker and Yokozuna, and a thirty-forty minute submission match for the title between Bret Hart and Bob Backlund, which would never take place on today's WWE. 1995 is best known for the no DQ championship match between Bret Hart and Diesel that began to turn Diesel heel and laid groundwork towards Hart- Michaels at Wrestlemania XII. 1996 featured the first match between Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin that had this really cool old veteran vs. new star feel to it. The Undertaker battles Mankind in a match that had crazy action for 1996 and Shawn Michaels does battle with Psyco Sid and the crazy NY fans cheer for Sid.
