The Watchers at the Shrine (1994)I liked the first book Plague a lot.  "After the Plague" was good, too, but character development was a little sketchy and I would have liked to have read a bit more about the years between the books.  "Plague" takes place right before the disease hits and during the days of the plague and follows three teenagers that survived."After the Plague" is 100 years after the devastation and is about some of the original teens' descendants.  Daniel grew up in a male dominant community.  He goes exploring, wanting to find his great-grandmother's diary, and happens upon members of a female dominant community. SPOILER ALERT:The main focus of the book is what happens to the males in the female dominant community, who are castrated when they turn 15 years old, to curb those wild male tendencies, you know.  I tell you, British authors have a strange idea on what chilren's books should be about.I liked the book and its discussions on male/female societies.  But I would NOT consider this trilogy to be for children - maybe high school.  I imagine some male adults might suffer a twinge or two reading this book although it does not go into details of the process.  The idea itself is horrific enough.I have ordered Watchers at the Shrine and will review it once I have read it.
