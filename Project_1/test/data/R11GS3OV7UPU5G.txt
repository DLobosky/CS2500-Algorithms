If you have owned Hoover products in the past and been happy with them, don't think that today's hoover products are the same.  I had an older, cheaper model of this carpet shampooer and loved it - I used it for 10years and it kept my carpet looking like new.  The only reason I even bought this one, is because I thought it would be better - I was wrong!  In the firs two uses, the cheap plastic pin that runs the brush roller broke - google it, and you will see it is a persistent problem - particularly if you have pets as it easily fills up with pet hair and exerts so much pressure on that pin that it shears it off - then the brushes no longer work.  Okay, so this was not good when it breaks in the first two uses, but I kept going and ordered a new brushroll ierwhich again the plastic pin sheared off after only 5 usesand I had to order another one!!! Ridiculous - two brushrolls in less than 6 mos.  If you don't heed my advice and you do purchase it, absolutely without a doubt make sure you pull the brushroll out after every use and thoroughly clean and pet hair that may be in there.  So okay, maybe if you don't have pets, the weak brushroll would not be such an issue, but there's more.  After about the 7th use, the handle on the cheap plastic dirty water bin broke off - again, google it and you will see this is also a common issue and a design flaw.  Hoover knows about these issues and has done absolutely nothing to remedy it or even release a newer improved model of this piece of unk.  Their products these days are made of such cheap flimsy plastic that they simply won't last.  My older one also had plastic parts, but it seemed sturdier and did in fact last a good 10years with virtually no issues, and I believe all the plastic parts were thicker and not so flimsy.  This one, operated identically to the old one, couldn't even go one month before the first broken part.  I have experienced the same cheap flimsy construction with my new Hoover windtunnel vacuum - parts are constantly breaking and falling off because of cheap shoddy construction and overall poor design.  So for me, I won't be buying any more Hoover products. Unfortunately I haven't found a better shampooer out there, so I'm patiently waiting for someone else to come up with a reasonably priced sturdy one.  I wish I had kept my older cheaper one, but unfortunately I donated it to charity before I realized how flimsy the new one was.
