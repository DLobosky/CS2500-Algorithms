The man of steel, a vapid California babe, a physicist, and a medical doctor...nothing doing.Table for Three, is supposed to be a sweet romantic movie about a poor guy that acts a lot like Ted Mosby (How I Met Your Mother), he falls in love quickly and wants to get married quickly. He works from home and needs a new room mate. After interviewing a bunch of losers, he finds Mary and Ryan. They seem attentive and nice. The 'hilarity' begins when the pair, a couple since high school, move in. They want to do everything with Scott, especially protect him from falling in love too quickly. It all starts off innocent and happy, but quickly spins out of control with Scott hating the couple.The strange part about this movie, the last 15 minutes are actually kind of a surprise and are half way decent. Some twists happen that almost save the film. Unfortunately, like a comedian telling a joke and then talking after the punch line, the film kept going for another 5 minutes after it should have ended. There is no reason why I had to know that about the happy couple. The cast is uneven. Brandon Routh (Superman Returns) as Scott, sadly delivers his lines dead pan and with very little emotion, it is hard to fell much from his character. Jesse Bradford (West Wing, the creepy Ryan Pierce), is just so irritating. Sophia Bush (One Tree Hill) was sometimes incredibly sexy, horribly cloying, and dumb; not exactly the best combination. Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory and Rosanne) was one of the few genuine, believeable interesting characters as a past victim of the Ryan and Mary disease. Jennifer Morrison (House) was absolutely stunning, beautiful, smart, quirky, interesting; and not on the screen nearly enough. The few high spots, Galecki, Morrison and occasionally Bush, were just not enough to salvage the whole film. Technically this is a simple, fairly low budget film. In general light was good. Sound well recorded. Shots were in focus. But there was nothing creative or compelling about framing, camera work, or editing. If it weren't for the language and nudity, this could have passed for a television program. The film is rated R. There is a lot of strong language, and sexual innuendo. There is a scene in a strip club with topless women. At one point Sophia Bush says, 'and I even wore panties' pulling up her dress to show her panties. This is the type of humor in the film. There is no violence or gore. Younger viewers, probably depends a lot on tolerance for language, situations, and nudity.The film is at least 20 minutes too long at one hour and thirty three minutes. The jokes climaxed early and then the comedian kept talking. The pay off was way too late in the film, and then it was diluted with a needless final poke at the happy couple. Most will stop watching after a half hour, Scott is just that boring, and Ryan that irritating. The DVD includes one of those awful making of featurettes where the actors and directors simply retell the whole story. They have nothing to add to an already overdrawn story. Do not watch this featurette before the film, the entire movie is told in roughly 25 minutes. Overall this is not a very good movie. Sophia Bush and Jennifer Morrison are pretty and worth watching. The ending is good. But there is just too much irritation along the way.
