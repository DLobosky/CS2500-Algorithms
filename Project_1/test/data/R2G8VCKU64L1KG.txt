I am pained to report that the experience was ultimately disappointing. Playing the role of Beckmesser I shall detail my complaints.The production: As with the other operas, there is great business with the back projections. Some of the images were appropriate to the stage action, others seemed purely decorative. I could not understand why there was a line of extras mimicing Siegfried's actions during the forging scene. I also found the almost mechanical forest scenery (Act 2)unappealing and the articulated dragon was a lost opportunity.The singing: Siegfried (Lance Ryan) has the most important role in this opera. While Ryan has a steady and strong voice, his tone is not particularly attractive and he lacks the golden radiance that characterises the greatest exponents of the role. The rest of the cast are very good; Wotan (Juha Uusitalo)and Brunnhilde (Jennifer Wilson)are particularly satisfying.The conducting: Zubin Mehta does not elicit such inspiring orchestral playing as encountered in the other 3 Ring operas. The more distant and less well balanced recording might partly account for this impression.The filming: Excellent as in the other operas.
