T. writes:In this expanded and updated edition of August Derleth's THIRTY YEARS OF ARKHAM HOUSE (1970) I have striven to make this volume much more than of a reference work than a catalogue--a work that might be of use to a variety of individuals, from collectors to librarians to scholars to general readers.  To that end, I have supplied not merely tables of contents of each volume published by Arkham House, but also brief accounts of some of the more significant features of those volumes, notes on reprints (in whole or in part), and an exhaustive index of names and titles.  The index of names lists every author, editor, cover artist, or other names found in the table of contents of each title or in my notes.  The title index lists every single work--story, essay, poem, introduction, etc.--contained in an Arkham House production."The book is amazing and contains many delightful illustrations of Arkham House authors by Allen Koszowski.
