This was just what I needed. I don't play games, I don't need portable music. I just want to keep my addresses & my many to-do lists organized.Good stuff:--Create as many to-do categories as you want.I've got over a dozen, including my grocery list. You can choose (or not) to view completed items, which makes it easy to keep a running grocery list. Just enter the items you usually buy, and deselect those you don't need on a particular shopping trip. They're still in the "Groceries" category, and will be exposed when you select the option, "Show Completed Items."--Use it to wake you up on the road.Has a non-annoying, just-loud-enough alarm that is easier and less irritating to use than hotel alarm clocks or your wristwatch.Not so good:--Watch out when you hot sync. The default is to download all your email. I ended up downloading about 100 messages. And I don't even use email on my m500. You have to delete them one-by-one, and I was afraid I was going to wear out the screen where I had to repeatedly tap "Delete" in the UI.--I can't get the "extended shift" to work to write in all caps. And sometimes it's very difficult to get the Graffiti system to recognize punctuation entries. This drives me nuts because I need everything to be grammatically correct, but if you don't mind a dash instead of a colon, you probably won't care.I got about a $25 rebate on my model. I never buy electronics that don't have rebates. Okay, I never buy electronics. But I'm hoping to make rebate-seeking a habit. I would recommend snooping around for rebate-happy models, except if you see them highlighted on the developer's site, beware. There was a color Palm that was being hyped with a rebate when I was shopping around, and I found out that it had a very low screen resolution. I can't deal with that. Make sure you compare the specs that are important to you.
