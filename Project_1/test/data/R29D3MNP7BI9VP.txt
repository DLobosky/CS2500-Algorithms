This didn't bother me, but for someone looking for a really "fun" workout, this might bother them.  She doesn't give a lot of tips on form, or sometimes the tips are so subtle I didn't even realize they were there until I had done the workout a few times.  If someone is completely new to barre work and prefers a lot of instruction on form, this might not be the best choice. The ring that Pure Barre sells on their web page to go with this DVD seems to be a little too big for some of the thigh work.  When placing the ring around my legs for the parallel leg plies, I had to move the ring higher up on my leg than what they say on the DVD or I would have been trying to do it bow legged. This wasn't a big deal and the exercise was still effective.  When doing plies with legs turned out, the ring is too big to place between my legs. I substituted with a yoga block as they have recommended on some Core Fusion DVDs I had.  A playground or exercise ball would also work fine as a substitute. While overall I really liked the use of the ring, in portions of the glute work it felt as if they were trying to design the workout around the ring, instead of using it where it seemed to make the most sense. For the first portion where you place the ring in the fold on the back of the knee, this seemed really awkward to me as the handle of the ring is so small.  I substituted with a small ball and this seemed to work much better. (Update: As I've used Lowry Lofts 2 a couple times now, the ring in back of the knee has kind of grown on me. It still can flop and drop to the floor on me sometimes.  One day I tried a ball in back of one knee and the ring on the other side, and I did feel the ring a little bit more.)  Also, I didn't really "get" the bent-knee portion where you push against the side of your leg for resistance.  After trying it that way several times I dropped the ring later and actually felt the exercise much more as I was able to concentrate more on form and working the muscle, and less on pushing against my leg.  I believe on the Lowry Lofts 2 DVD they do not use the ring for the similar exercise. Finally, the stretching at the end is so brief that I just skip it completely and do my own stretches. Although there are some issues that I mentioned above, overall I really do like this DVD.  It is a fast paced, no fluff workout.  It was easy to modify for the issues I mentioned.  I do plan on using this on an ongoing basis as part of my Saturday rotation.
