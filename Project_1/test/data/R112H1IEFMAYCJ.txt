In my early quilting days I typically laid the blocks out in straight rows, added sashing and cornerstones and called it good. Then I learned to use setting triangles and put the blocks on point. I was amazed at the difference it could make in the look of a quilt. This book takes settings to much more interesting levels without making them so complex that you will lose interest in the project.The first chapter introduces you to the basic principles Sharyn uses when preparing to design with a set of blocks. The next seven chapters each take one of her basic setting designs and go into the possibilities and technicalities of that layout. The chapters end with multiple color photos of a variety of quilts using that particular setting, with a little description of how the quilter accomplished the finished product. This part made me want to grab some blocks and start working, but I restrained myself. The ninth chapter showcases a few more quilts that were made using the ideas in this book. The final chapter gives instructions for 18 of the blocks used in many of the quilts throughout the book. A chart helps you make the blocks in either 6" or 9" sizes. This is for those who may not have sets of blocks to work with, but want to try the techniques applied in making the featured quilts. There are also charts and diagrams to help you get the proper size of setting and corner triangles, calculating the correct size for coping triangles, and other handy tips to make the process easier. If you are a quilter who likes to buy a pattern based on the photo of the quilt and replicate it as closely as possible, this book may not meet your needs. But if you are someone who buys a pattern just for part of the idea and you are never sure how you are going to finish a quilt until you actually get there, this may be your kind of book. The possibilities are endless. I have several sets of blocks currently waiting to be used, but I have not been inspired before now with a setting that I felt did them justice. Now the difficulty is in deciding between several settings that have caught my eye. Some quilt books seem so rigid and rule-bound that they stifle me. This book and Sharyn's other book about sets, "Setting Solutions," are refreshing in that they take a "you-can-make-it-work" approach. I feel like I have been given a new perspective on quilt settings that has recharged my enthusiasm for setting blocks and I won't have so many UFOs piling up around me.
