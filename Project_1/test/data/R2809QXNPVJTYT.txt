"CSI" player Gary Dourdan stars as a lawyer whose idea to "spice up" his marriage with another female bedmate turns into a nightmare of epic proportions.  Made on a shoestring budget (the boom mike makes an un-credited appearance at least twice), the film benefits from a swiftly moving story, credible acting, and Atlanta locations.Fans of "Unfaithful", "Fatal Attraction", and 60's Ross Hunter films will find something to love (or loathe) about this flick.
