Lots of challenges, descent graphics and physics, gamplay is smooth, and it is performing very well on my 6-year old Pentium 4 XP computer.Install was easy and I used a no-cd patch so that I can play my game without having the disc in all the time.  There were a couple glitches upon saving a game at first, but all seems fine now.You can save whenever you want, making some of the more challenging missions easier to fininsh.  So far I am having a great time with this game ... so much so, that I also purchased Ubersoldier 2, which is loads of fun, too.  You can't go too wrong with this fun bargain priced game ... recommended.
