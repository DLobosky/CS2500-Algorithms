I picked out this set for a couple of 80 yr olds and they could not be happier.  I was first told by a relative of these old folks to get an LED LCD no matter what (someone who thinks he is a tech guru).  So I purchased 2 different 46" models, brought them home and calibrated those the best I could.  Sure if you are sitting perfectly centered the PQ is solid, but move off center even a few inches and the colors fade and the blacks wash out.  Even centered I just could not get as accurate color or as natural of a picture as I wanted.  After a couple weeks of trying to be happy with these sets, I just couldn't take it and returned them.  I purchased the 50" G20 model, the set I was originally planning to get, and am very pleased with the results.  Not only is it superior, but it was several hundred dollars less expensive and 4" larger.  Yes, it's not the ½" thick sexy set but unless you're wall mounting does that matter one bit...PQ out of the box is not impressive as it is set to Standard mode.  First thing first is to set the mode to THX, which greatly improves upon the color accuracy and gamma tracking.  Black levels on this plasma are very good.  No they are not Kuro level, but they are superior to any non-local dimming LCD minus the blooming and for less than half the price.  Now for THX mode if you are not going to get it calibrated, use Warm 1 for the Color Temp.  This is slightly cooler than D65 whereas Warm 2 is slightly warmer.  Almost all people would prefer a slightly cooler grayscale instead of slightly too warm.  If you prefer the other, go ahead and use Warm 2 (this is what a calibrator would use and drop the temp a bit), but you may find it too "yellow" for your tastes.  You may need to do some minor tweaking with the basic contrast, brightness and color settings.  Assuming you have a HD source, turn off all the extra garbage settings such as NR and Color Management.  For great advice on settings, search for the G20/G25 settings thread at AVS forum.  It has more info than you could hope for and some `starter settings.'As far as other features of the set go, the G series does have a swivel stand which is nice, and the lower end Pannys lack.  It also has the apps which won't get used for who I bought this for, but they are there with more available all the time.  Panasonics also have the SD slot, for which the interface is much improved over previous years.  It is easier and faster to navigate and has the ability to display videos, music and pictures.  For pictures, you can customize slideshow settings and effects to your liking - a nice feature for those who wish to share images.  The firmware can also be updated via an internet connection, something I recommend you do upon first using the set.  It only takes a couple minutes and couldn't be easier.  The sound on this set is decent, especially considering it has down-firing speakers.  Obviously if you are picky about audio you'll have a separate system, but for those who just want to hear the TV it will get the job done.Overall the G20/G25 series is a great value that I highly recommend if you are looking for a quality picture at a good price and have no interest in 3-D.  If you think you will have any interest in 3-D, go ahead and get a capable set so you don't regret it in the future. The best 2-D sets are also 3-D, so if you are looking for the very best 2-D PQ, you'll have to get a 3-D panel.  If you just want a good 2-D picture, this is near the top of the 2-D list and if you take price into account, it moves to the top.
