Great book.  Like Boyd it may have a few flaws but also like Boyd it is unlikley that the story could be told with such passion and still be free of perhaps some questionable conclusions.  The author did a geat job of telling a huge complex story within a relativly few pages.  I wish I could get my MBA students to read the book for the lessons of how much damage institutional wisdom can do,  Boyd's OODA loop and perhaps most importantly the lessons on character, integrity and sacrifice.  Highly recommended.  My only reservations were that  the author's  passion overcame a more balanced look at a number of aircraft including the F-14  whose mission priorities were not dogfighting.  Like Boyd,  the F-14 has outlived its critics.  His discussion of the F111 missed the higher level political environment when McNamara and his group of bright young MBA's prostituted their analysis to give the contract to General Dynamics at the behest of the then VP.  The story also omits the credit due Adm Tom Conolly and others who sacrificed their careers to stop the F-111 naval version.  As others have noted footnotes would have been welcome.  More information on his EM work  would have added to the book.
