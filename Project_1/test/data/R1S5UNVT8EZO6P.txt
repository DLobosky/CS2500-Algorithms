Review for Kindle Classics edition of Kim: B0011Q61BO:No italics (except on verses). Straight quotes. Dashes are hyphens. Paragraph breaks are OK, but spaced as well as indented. Verses at least have lines on separate lines, but not well formatted. Extra page breaks after chapter headings.Usual typos, e.g. Busts for buts. Pincers for pencase.There are better editions available. If you're looking for a Kindle edition of Kim, don't just search for "Kim". That only finds a few of the many editions. Search for "Kim Kipling" (without the quotes) to find the 30 or so editions available. And also look for my review "Kindle Edition Choice is critical" for a review of all the available editions as of May 2010.
