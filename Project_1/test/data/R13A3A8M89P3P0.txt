This has 5 sessions, each at just 10 minutes:1) ABS - Fun, yet a great and fast workout for the stomach and waist.2) THIGHS - You can feel the difference after just one session! Loved this one.3) BUNS - I was suprized how much fun this was and I could feel the difference!4) ARMS & SHOULDERS - This is my favorite because you use 5 weights! Because it is just 10 minutes, the weights SHAPE and TRIM the arms in a short time! 5) BONUS POWERSTRETCH - Great cooldown! Also, I could feel the stretch all over in my body and was relaxed and felt great after this one!***Just so you will know*** This is a SUPERB BEGINNER DVD, and you can choose one of the five to do for just 10 minutes or as many as you want, the menu lets you customize the workout. If I could give this one 10 stars, I would!
