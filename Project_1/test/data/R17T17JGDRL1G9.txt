I was a huge fan of the borrower books when I was young, so I was excited to see this movie and see how true the movie was to the books. Overall, the movie did a good job at putting forth the main tenets of the way in which the borrowers live. I was excited to share this story with my own girls as well. In watching this, I have to say that first the movie has a great plot that brings together a great story of friendship and as well as growing up and learning the real truths that may have alluded the characters in the past. While the ending may not be what I would have expected (but should have), it was still a very good movie and the girls loved it. At first they were a bit confused by the Japanese license plates, but once we explained where this was made they got past this very quickly. Overall, this was an amazing movie that I would highly recommend to all!
