I tried these and the Medela pads, and the Lansinoh pads were so much better.  They are a bit thicker than the Medela pads, but still thin enough to where they won't show through your clothes.  I never leaked much, so the absorbency of these pads was never really tested by me, but they worked well when I was opening my nursing bra for frequent feedings.  The adhesive wore off quickly and the pad did not stay stuck to the bra, but the pad held its shape was easy to put back into place.  I have been very happy with these nursing pads.
