The best headphones I have ever had.  3 times better than the Bose® QuietComfort® 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones and 2 times better than the Audio-Technica ATH-A900 Headphones at a $50 to $100 lower price.  I just got these headphones today and will update this review later.  The sound is great right out the box, the bass is awesome. The low,middle and high are wonderful,the soundstage is very real sounding.  They sound great with Netflix instant movies.  They about 2/3 the size of my ATH-A900,but fit about the same.  They are comfortable.  They look even better than the pictures.  Their are two cords that come with these headphones.  One is  3 feet long with volume control and microphone.  It also has a pause/play button,if you hit the button twice it skips ahead, hit it 3 times it goes back.  The second is 5.75 feet long. The carrying case is sturdy,has straps to carry your accessories and looks great.  If you looking for headphones that look and sound awesome,look no farther.  Update 12-13-2010 These headphones sound even better now that I have burned them in by leaving on high volume over a couple nights.  Update 3-28-2011 I still love these headphones.  There are no cracks and I wear them about 12 hours a day for over 4 months.  I am glad I bought them when I did because amazon has ran out of rouge.  Update 1-6-2012 The ear pads have fallen apart,they will not stand up to moist hair over a long period of time.  I bought Monster iSport Immersion In-Ear Headphones with ControlTalk - Black to replace the headphones.  My new earphones as good or better.
