Lucy Grealy writes her painful story from age 9 and we are with her every step of the way through her many painful ordeals.  Lucy is a seemingly normal 9 year old child growing up in a disjointed and admittedly dysfunctional family.  She is diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a cancer with an alrmingly low survival rate.  Although she has a twin sister, she rarely talks about her.  You get the impression the family is not close, nor are they very supportive of one another.  When her father is hospitalized for a serious illness, Lucy only goes to see him one time.  Although the stay is extensive, they just stay at home, waiting for phone updates on their father's condition.  Only her mother seems to make many appearances at the hospital where Lucy spends the majority of her pre-pubescent years.  Lucy Grealy is a person who is obssessed with her appearance.  She talks about not really knowing who she is and what she looked like before her surgery, therefore, her post surgery appearance is the defining one for her.  She is grossly disfugured, not only by the cancer and the resulting surgeries and treatments, but by the many surgeries performed in an attempt to repair the damage.  Unfortunately, no clear thinking adult ever steps forward to get this poor child any kind of counseling or therapy, and she spends much of her life tortured by secret shame.  She strives to be strong enough to make her mother proud, to be the model patient and to portray herself as a person who really doesn't care about her appearancence.  Sadly, as most women know, this is not the case, especially in a society obsessed by appearances.  In my review of Truth and Beauty, I refer to the article Lucy Grealy's sister Suellen wrote in reaction the the publication of that book.  My question to the Grealy family would be; where were all of you?  I understand the family had many problems, but to be angry at Patchett and the other friends of Lucy's who were their for her when her own family wasn't seems misplaced.  especially because the publication of this book precedes that of this book.  And Lucy's own book is clearly an indictment of the disinterest of the Grealy family. This is the life story of an extremely unhappy and disturbed person.  She needed serious therapy to deal with her serious physical illness and all its side effects.  Sadly, she was neglected in this way.  Yes, through her writing and many of her relationships (some healthy, most not) she found a way in the world, but if you read Truth and Beauty and learn of the rest of her life through the eyes of a bystander, you see the personality that develops from the pain that was her early life.  Well written and fast moving, this (Lucy's book) is a different kind of story than any other you will ever read.  Brutally honest and excuciatingly sad, Lucy seemed to believe all she was was a face, and the only way to true happiness was to be loved and adored by a "lover."  If only she was able to embrace herself as so much more than just a face, but a spirit that transcended what she looked like.  If the title was Autobiography of a Soul, this would have been a different book, and this life may have had a different outcome...
