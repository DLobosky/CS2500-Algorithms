The problem with either of these methods is that my floor is left with a film of dirt and detergent after I'm done.  The big advantage of the Hoover Floormate over the mop and bucket is that it applies a solution of detergent and clean, hot water to the floor, scrubs it with the rotating brushes, and then sucks the dirty water back into a separate holding container.  Like other reviewers, I didn't find using the FloorMate as a dry vacuum to be very effective, so I begin my cleaning process by vacuuming the floor.  I also didn't find that the FloorMate did a very good job cleaning my very dirty grout.  The best method I found for cleaning the grout was to spray it first with Hoover AH30285 Floor Mate 32-Ounce Tile and Grout Spray, wait 4-6 minutes, scrub it with an Oxo Good Grips 37481 Grout Brush, wipe up the excess cleaner and loosened dirt with a sponge and then scrub with the FloorMate.  This is a very labor intensive process, and is probably only necessary once or twice a year.  Now that the grout is clean, I'm hoping that the FloorMate will do a decent job by itself.  I basically only use the FloorMate in the 'Wash' mode.  I don't use the 'Wet Pickup' mode because the FloorMate does a great job sucking up the water in Wash mode, and, as mentioned previously, I don't use the 'Dry Vac' mode at all.Overall, I rate the Hoover FloorMate H3044 as a very good value, considering the cost and performance.  It is a bit specialized, and won't replace your vacuum cleaner and manual grout brush.
