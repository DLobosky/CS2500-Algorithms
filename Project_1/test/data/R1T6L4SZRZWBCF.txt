This is a wonderful piece...the chain that came with it is quite nice.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought the stone would be a bit more blue...it's really more cream-colored than blue-colored (there's just a tiny hint of blue and from the pictoral description I was expecting quite a bit more blue than what I rec'd).  However, not every piece will be like mine is!  I still enjoy wearing it with many blue tops.Otherwise, super!
