In the movie, an eccentric billionaire, (Hopkins),  and a slick playboy, (Baldwin), who's after the billionaire's model wife,  find themselves stranded in the Alaskan wilderness together after a plane  crash.  ENTER:  THE BEAR!  This bear truly deserves an Oscar for his role,  because his menacing presence will scare the pants off of you - even as you  sit watching from the safety of your own livingroom! In the film, the bear  appears to be stalking the men in the wildnerness, which creates an almost  PALPABLE AIR OF TENSION; in addition to the suspicion and rivalry that is  ALREADY going on between the two main characters!
