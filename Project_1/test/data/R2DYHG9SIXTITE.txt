The rules are fairly simple, you've colorful elephants carrying around and trading silk, palaces to build, and the game is not that hard to learn, taking about an hour to play. Yet there is a lot more to the game than first meets the eye, and it will also hold the interest of strategic board game fans. (The latter should note it's the lightest of Ystari's games, with action points, move and deliver and an economic flavor.)Players take on the role of merchants, buying silk of various colors from trading posts, selling them to dynamic markets in cities, building palaces to generate additional income, and vying for a limited number of city and client tokens. If you don't watch what your opponents are doing and think ahead a bit, you might find yourself in a bit of trouble. This makes the game interactive without being aggressive.Bombay is a good gateway game with broad appeal in the tradition of The Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride. Another one by Ystari to check out for a fun game with broad appeal is Yspahan.
