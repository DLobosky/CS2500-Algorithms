The question is, if you use just one, will the other two dry out before you get to use them? UPDATE: NO, the cartridges all worked fine.  The cheapest source for these today is on ebay.This is the result of the ancient Chinese custom of making "extra" (whether handbags, sneakers, or printer cartridges) after a production run for a name brand, then selling on the black market.
