This book packs lots and lots of information and some good stories into 250pp.  They write in a simple, accessible style that make this readable for just about anyone.The authors are unabashed fans of New Orleans who continually gush about their city.  They do not seem to hide the seedier elements of their city, but they do tend to excuse or rationalize them.  For example,  the 'reform' mayor of the 1880s (Shakespear) set up a system of bribe taking from illegal gambling establishment in exchange for police protection -- but he only did this, they report, because the prudish state of Louisiana unjustly kept gambling illegal.  And besides, Shakespear, originally at least, used the funds to set up alms houses.  Sure!  Similar explanations are given for the racial injustice of the city, its hedonism, etc.I don't know enough about New Orleans history to make any informed evaluation of their historical judgments.  But it seems obvious that the authors know their topic.The packaging, at least in my 2002 printed edition, is unimaginative and basic, but solid.Overall, I'd recommend this highly as a nice overview, a tour guide, and a primer for NOLA history.
