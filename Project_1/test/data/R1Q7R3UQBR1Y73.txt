Undoubtedly one of the high points in 90's cinema, Night Shyamaln's third offering scores on so many fronts that in the final analysis it could well be vaunted as a future classic. Perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the whole affair (aside from Willis actually delivering a solid performance  with real characterisation for once) is that this film chills so clinically  effectively without the need to rely on bulk-standard special effects. No,  this is creative filmmaking delivered with confidence and flair.  Willis is  noted child psychologist Malcolm Crowe who becomes involved with troubled  nine-year-old Cole Sear (played utterly superbly by Haley Joel Osment) who  is haunted by, apparently, visions of the dead. Slowly, step by step, Crowe  gets the boy to open up to him but the further he delves into the child's  psyche, the greater his suspicion the boy's problems are not merely an  unbalanced mental state. Whilst the main structure of the story isn't particularly  outstanding, its given weight by sterling performances all round with top  honours going to Haley Joel Osment who delivers an outstanding performance  as the outcast, over-sensitive, tormented main subject. I've viewed this film in excess of a dozen times now, it's  that engrossing and I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying this is an  essential viewing/purchase. Mad Ferret, London
