Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) sits in the playground thinking about his childhood living with the horrible Dursley's. Dudley (Harry Melling) is meaner than ever towards his cousin. He asks Harry in a hurtful way, "Where is your mum?". Dudley knows very well that his mother and father are dead. He gets Harry upset, on purpose, and Harry lashes out at him with a magic wand at Dudley's throat and chin. The other mean kids with Dudley laugh at Harry. Suddenly, a great storm develops in the sky. Harry is not causing it to happen. They both run. In a walk-through tunnel, the Dementors attack Harry and Dudley. Harry uses his magic wand to fight off the Dementors. They got Dudley good. Mrs. Figg (Kathryn Hunter) comes along to check on Harry.  Back at home, an owl delivers a talking mailer to Harry. Because he has used  magic outside the school, he is expelled from the Hogwart's School of Witchery and Wizardry. The Dursley's take Dudley to the hospital because he is loopy. Mad-Eye (Brendan Gleeson) with others come to take Harry to the Order of the Phoenix Headquarters. He has the right to a hearing to be expelled or not. In the building,  Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) greets him. She shows him the room where Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are. They welcome him. The Weasley twins (James Phelps, Oliver Phelps) and Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) are there, as well as, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Remus Lipin (David Thewlis). They explain to Harry that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned and is after the Minister's job. Voldemort wants to recruit his army of witches and wizards. He is also after one more thing.  Molly suddenly stops the men from telling Harry. She chimes, "He is just a boy".  Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), who comes from the Ministry Council, comes to teach at Hogwart's School, appears to be proper, but turns about face and practices education reform and wants to change everything about the school, much to the dismay of Professor Dumbleore (Michael Gambon) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith).
