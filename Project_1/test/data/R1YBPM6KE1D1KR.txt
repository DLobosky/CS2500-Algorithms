I upgraded from a Transcend 8GB to this 16GB card for my new panasonic lumix zs1 camera. Although the 8GB was quite enough for me as I never even reached close to running out of memory, I was fascinated by the thought of how much a 16Gb can hold. I was told that the bigger flash cards cause all kinds of trouble like not being able to access photos and losing data. I have had no problems at all with this 16GB card. It works like a charm and is fast with data transfer as I have been making movies with no sticking or stopping for data transfer reasons. People like me who want massive storage space on their camera so that they do not ever have to download to a computer (or very infrequently), I highly recommend this Transcend 16GB flash card.
