The film has an interesting history. Churchill wanted to make an homage to the Army in the same way that "In Which we Serve" (1942) glorified the British Navy, so he asked Army Major David Niven to assist. Niven turned to fellow actor Peter Ustinov who just finished an Army training film ("The New Lot") with director Carol Reed, and they expanded that film to make this one. Several of the actors from that film worked on this one, and Reed continued as director.Suave David Niven (1910-83) plays the Lieutenant. He won an Oscar for "Separate Tables" (1959) and a Golden Globe for "The Moon is Blue" (1953), but he's probably best known for his role as Phileas Fogg in "Around the World in 80 Days" (1956). When the film was made, Niven was still serving as a Major in the British Army.Musical hall performer Stanley Holloway (1890-1982) plays one of the infantrymen. Among his 50+ films, he's best known for his Oscar and Golden Globe nominated performance in "My Fair Lady" (1964). Holloway served in World War 1 as part of the "Black and Tans".Leo Genn (1905-78) plays the Captain. He is best remembered for his role as Petronius in "Quo Vadis" (1951) for which he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor. He had brief but effective roles in "Moby Dick" (1956) and "The Longest Day" (1962). His voice was so strong and resonant that he often did narration for films (e.g., Khartoum) and was the voice of the royal coronation in 1937 and 1953. Genn was a Lt. Col. in the Royal Artillery in WW 2.James Donald (1917-93) is another infantryman. Donald favored military films and appeared in supporting roles in "In Which We Serve" (1942), "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957, "King Rat" (1965), and most memorably as Group Captain Ramsey in "The Great escape" (1963). He more often played a sincere but humorless soldier.Look for an uncredited Trevor Howard in his screen debut. He plays an officer on a ship.Director Carol Reed (1906-76) was nominated 3 times for an Oscar winning for "Oliver" (1968) and won a Palme d'Or for "The Third Man" (1949). He made 33 films between 1935 and 1972, but his most productive period was around the war - "Night Train to Munich" (1940), "The True Glory" (1945), "Odd Man Out" (1947).We normally think of Peter Ustinov (1921-2004) as an actor, since he was nominated 4 times for an Oscar and won twice - "Topkapi" (1964) and "Spartacus" (1960) - and 5 times nominated for an Emmy with 3 wins. But Ustinov was also a talented director, with DGA nominations for "Billy Budd" (1962) and "Romanoff and Juliet" (1961) and worked as a writer on 20+ films. This was his first outing as a writer.FWIW - In real life, 21 year old Private Ustinov served as an orderly assigned to Lt. Niven. Look for Ustinov in a brief role as a French bar keeper.1944 was not a strong year for films. "Going my Way" was the big multiple Oscar winner.  "Gaslight" did well at the box office and won Ingrid Bergman an Oscar. Other notable films were Judy Garland's "Meet me in St Louis", "Double Indemnity", "Arsenic and Old Lace". War films were popular - "Lifeboat", "Since You Went Away", "To Have and Have Not", "Hollywood Canteen", "The Fighting Seabees", "Ministry of Fear", "Passage to Marseille", and "The Fighting Sullivans".The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called the film "A warm and touching tribute to the British Army infantryman." He added - "The authors have beautifully outlined a group of intriguing characters, Mr. Reed has disposed them in credible images and all the actors have played them most trenchantly."The film has some strongly drawn characters, but the poor production values and the dull fighting scenes make it difficult to recommend as a film. As a piece of WW 2 propaganda it does have some historical value, but as a film there are far better films from this era to choose from.
