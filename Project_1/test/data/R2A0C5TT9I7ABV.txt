I am in the process of dealing with jlab regarding the warranty. Lets see if the warranty is better than the ear phones. Hopefully it is. The warranty is excellent, their customer service is great, they want to keep the customer happy and are very eager to replace if they become defective. They are in the process of a design change. I have had to have 5 replaced under warranty, tooooo much of a headache, if I had it to do over again I Would Not Purchase IF I had it to do over again. Great sound while they work, fit well, just not very durable!!Update 7-26-11I have purchased two J3M (one for present for son) and One J3. They fit great and sound very good while working. However Jlab has replaced the J3M two times (for me) and I have a warranty request in for a 3rd replacement. Jlab has ask that I return them before they can proceed with claim.I also have a warranty request in for the J3 also. The problem that I have is that one of the ear phones stop working, no sound. Use them with I phone and treadmill. My son's Jbuds J3M also stoped working 2 months ago. Something smelling sort of fishy here. I am a 63 yr. old man that takes care of his toys. Have been using the ear phones that came with my I Phone almost 3 yrs. ago with no problem with them. Just wanted what I thought was a upgrade, begining to wonder if this was a good move.Jubuds look good, sound great while working, great dealing with warranty folks, just do not last very long. Not very durable. They are very eager to help you and want to keep the customer happy, they are makeing changes to the design to make more durable. Excellent customer service!!The Jbuds sound great but I have had to have 5 pair replace under warranty. Do not purchase this unless you like dealing with replaceing them after about 3 months of use. Jlab is very good about replaceing under warranty, just a headache
