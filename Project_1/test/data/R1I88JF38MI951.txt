I attached this product to a Road Runner cable modem, and with the accompanying SMC card in my Vaio Z505-HS (running Win98), it seems to work just fine. Just make sure you get the firmware upgrade.  (see below)The Access Point has a tendency to go to sleep if not used for several hours (for example overnight). It is easily woken up by power cycling (unplugging and replugging the power supply). On practicallynetworked.com the solution mentioned is to upgrade the firmware. I tried to download the new firmware from SMC, but the format of the zip files cannot be opened by WinZip. They're supposedly some ancient version of zip from the mid 90's.The solution to this is to call SMC (1-800-SMC-4-YOU) and have them email you the firmware upgrade.  The version you want is AP14g8.  You will also need a crossover internet cable (...) so you can connect your computer to the access point.  SMC will give you the static IP settings you need and walk you through the firmware upgrade.I had to actually run the utility that came with the SMC card before the Vaio could talk to Road Runner. Setting up the network settings from native Win98 was not sufficient. (See next paragraph.)My 3Com AirConnect wireless PC card from work does not seem to be able to talk to this access point. The SMC card works fine on the wireless network at work, so it's not a reciprocal problem. I suspect this may be due to the fact the 3Com driver does not support all the functions that the SMC access point uses, such as channel number. My officemate has a wireless SMC router at home with a Lucent Gold Card and reports it works. (My SMC card works with her router as well.)Overall the access point works fine once you take care of the firmware upgrade.  (This is why I gave it only 4 stars)
