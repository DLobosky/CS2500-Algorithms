What a point of view, so obvious when one thinks about it but nevertheless so shocking because no one ever does. If you have always admired and loverd the tale of Socrates this book will knock your socks off. You will never believe it. Leave it to Mr. Stone. This is a great book for Greek philosophy fans. You're going to love it. It is a classic.Books written by Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher: "Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A.." "A Summer with Charlie" "A Little Something: Poetry and Prose" "Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother" "The Eastpointer" Selections from award winning column.
