The character development system is (at least for me) totally new, and it works to give you a more well-rounded character, allowing you to spend experience as soon as you get it if you need to.  The story is pretty interesting, and the game is by no means easy.  To me, this game is very similar to Neverwinter Nights, and if you liked that, you'll surely find Drakensang to be a good game for you.  However, there are some quirks to the game system that tend to make this one of the most difficult to play games I've ever met.  It's not that the game is really hard in that battles are difficult, or quests are too obscure, it's just feels like developers often went to great lengths to ensure that their game packed in lots of annoying quirks.  Looting animals is a great example - you loot them the first time, then you get something, let's say a rat tail.  Then if you have a character with sufficient skill, you will be able to search more, and you'll get leather strips or something.  So in essence, you have to search every dead animal twice just to get all the stuff out of it.  There are a few other things like this that are unnecessarily annoying, and they are frequent enough to be a bother.  Another problem that I've noticed with this game is that it is incredibly linear.  There is no problem with linear RPGs, but in at least half of the conversations in the game, you get only one dialog option, particularly in the beginning of the game.  It would be nice to be able to voice something other than the get-through-the-game-as-a-polite-gentleman option.  This is also a problem with character creation; granted, there are a good 15 or so classes to choose from, but all the characters of one type look exactly the same, so you can't do any customization.  In addition, some of the characters simply will not get you through the harder difficulty levels of this game, the archer for instance.  One would assume that Archery is a great skill to have if you're actually adventuring through this game, but in practice, you start every difficult battle about 5 paces from your enemy, and by the time you've strung your bow, the bad guys are already bashing your head in with a club.  And it's not like it's just this way with a few fights, it's a constant problem that never seems to stop.  In the end, you can build an archer character and beat the game, but your archer will start to act and feel much more like a warrior than a true archer.  Then there is the #1 problem with the game - the camera.  Because this is a game with an over-the-shoulder camera system, it automatically presents a big problem if one of your party members is fighting, and another is up a flight of stairs or around a corner.  When this happens, you are only allowed to target on things you can see, or if you're lucky, that the camera can see around a bend.  If you are on the bottom of a staircase and your party is fighting on the second floor, there is little way for your characters on the first floor to pilot themselves around the staircase and up to the fight without manually controlling them the whole way. And then what do you do with your spellcasters who need attention?   Even in non-fighting situations, it can be a bother when you can't position the camera correctly while exploring the world map, and you end up looking down upon your main character, where you can see maybe twenty feet around them.  Of course, you can spend time adjusting the camera, but after a while, it just takes a lot of time to fiddle with it, and sometimes, it just isn't worth it.  Like I said, Drakensang is a mostly quality game, and hard-core RPG fans will love it, but it's major flaws are too much for it to overcome.
