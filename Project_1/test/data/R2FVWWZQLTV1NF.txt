Hi.  I'd read the reviews and hoped this radio was all it's cracked up to be.  It is!  I've used Sony and Kaito radios in my basement in an attempt to find one that receives FM signals consistently and static free.  The PR-D7 does this and more.  The sound quality is excellent, programming stations in the presets is intuitive, and the volume control is smooth.  When this unit is turned off using an in-line switch (e.g. a light switch) the internal switch (on/off switch the user pushes) goes off so if you put the unit in a hard to reach place and depend on a in-line switch it won't work.  You must push the on/off switch to power the unit on.  Also the color is white and I'd have preferred a darker color however it looks very nice.  In my woodshop it just may start looking dusty.  In summary, this is a fantastic radio.
