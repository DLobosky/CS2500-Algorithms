Animals included in the book are elephants, boar, tigers, insects, chickens, roosters, peacocks, heron, ducks, geese, birds of prey, cockatoos, parrots, horses, puppies--you get the picture. Lots of images, some of them very nice--but no CD-ROM. If you want to combine the images or manipulate them for artistic use, you will have to scan them, and if you want to scan any of the numerous images that span two pages, you will have to take the book apart.Since the text is Japanese, I cannot say anything about license to use the book for personal or small scale commercial production. While the book is quite beautiful, I think it has limited usefulness as a design book because there is no CD-ROM, and that is why I gave it only four stars.
