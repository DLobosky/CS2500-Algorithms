It's a pearly white with charcoal grey accents--very pretty.  The large display tells you everything you'd want to know about your player and music.  Plus you can customize the LED colors--Mesmerizing!!!  And you can program different colors for different functions and menu windows.SOUND QUALITY: It's like you're directly injecting music into your veins.  Seriously...it's that good.  Compared to the iPod (which I had) and Creative muvo/zen nano (which I also have).  And it plays more formats of music than most players.  ACCESSORIES: It comes with a metal neck strap that is covered with clear plastic so that it doesn't rub your skin off.  I thought it wasn't attractive enough to be hooked up to my player.  So I didn't use it.  Headphones...what can I say about stock headphones.  Very sub par and they're white thanks to the apple revolution.  Get good ones or it's really just a waste.  It comes with a clear plastic case.  It's like those clear cell phone cases that have a snap button.  I didn't like it.  Lint and dirt would get under the case plus the plastic, though it protects your player from getting scratched, gets scratched itself.  Ugly.  My Creative Muvo/Zen nano came with a silicon case.  Much better.ORGANIZATION: Like most non-Apple products, it lets you sort your music in folders, playlists.  And loading it up is a breeze as it just appears on your computer as a removable drive.  You don't have to install software or use iTunes.  Though you can of course.BATTERY LIFE:  Well, this depends on your battery.  I use rechargeable Ni Metal Hydrides. And I highly recommend those. WHY I RETURNED IT:  Due to its need to be sleek, it has two scrolly wheels for navigation and two buttons: pause and menu. But it has WAY too many functions for so little buttons.  Menus are not intuitive to navigate.  You have to scroll both wheels at the same time/alternating from one to the other to get from menu to menu.  And in the end it was too cumbersome to use all the awesome functions much less navigating through your folders and music.  (I had similar problems with the iPod except iPods had too little functions and only one stupid wheel that was overly sensitive.)In the end I sacrificed sound quality for an easier to use player.  But iAudio has lots of models that might be easier to use.  G3, U2....
