I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick, rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees, elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles. Great product for a little price!
