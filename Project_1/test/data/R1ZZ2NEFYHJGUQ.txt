After that, Geoff Johns began preluding the 'Blackest Night' event with story arcs that laid down the foundation for a climactic and epic War of Light.  The story's complexity steadily increases as Johns builds on the concepts and premise of the comic, and the art is always top notch.The notion behind the War of light, with its rainbow assortment of Lantern Corps, each powered by the emotional spectrum, chanting oaths and shining their rings across the galaxy, is admittedly a pretty silly one at its core.  It takes a talented writer of Geoff Johns' caliber to transcend the series beyond the superhero genre and transform it into the compelling character-driven space opera, that it is.   Warning..  Amazon's description for 'Agent Orange' is very inaccurate.  Daxam, Sodam Yat, Akrillo and Mongul do not appear in this book.There are currently a lot of moving parts to 'Green Lantern', and 'Agent Orange' is no exception.  There's as much character-development as there is for the plot.  I don't like to give away spoilers, so here's a vague summary of what to expect:  Fatality is back, and ready for love.  Hal is still struggling with his new ring, and the subtly pietistic themes behind Ganthet's and Sayd's Blue Lanterns are elaborated on.  The Avarice Corps is introduced, when Larfleeze, 'Agent Orange' breaks his silence after a millennia of pining away in the Vega system; he proves to be truly dastardly but a joy to read.  The story ends with a whopper of a twist, that exposes a great deal of the Green Lantern Guardians' deception and facism.Guest artist, Philip Tan superbly illustrates this story arc.  The panels are stark and muddy, but fluid and detailed.  His creature designs for the Orange Lanterns are fantastic and authentically alien; however, his characters at times can be a tad bulky and malformed.  Tan's style is best suited to the realm of horror, and this arc has plenty of horror on tap.  The coloring is a bit inconsistent throughout, but it's nothing that takes away from the overall quality.  Ivan Reis is the preferred artist for 'Green Lantern'; however, I enjoyed the fresh take on the series.'Agent Orange' layers the 'Green Lantern' title with more interpersonal drama, plot twists and foreshadowing of things to come.  The highlight of course is the introduction to the Avarice corps, which is a corps entirely unlike the rest, involving rather unique and entertaining dynamics.  Larfleeze is one of DC's most intriguing and bizarre personalities, and the powerful Light of Avarice he wields not only effectively compliments his character, it presents a possibly unbeatable challenge to the Green Lanterns. Geoff Johns balances the grimness prevalent in this arc with well-placed humor, and with the help of magnificently raw and eerily gorgeous artwork, he takes our favorite green protagonist into dangerous and unknown territory. Highly Recommend.
