If you aren't a fan ,or at least open minded to cheaply made horror movies by regional directors and actors , many of whom are first timers then you shouldn't buy this. But these movies are great fun and deserve to be released on dvd.   The many trailers are great fun too as well as the rare short films.  ALthough "virgin witch' is a higher budget and better made movie than most of the other flicks in the trailer sections.  The first movie from 1961 is in ed wood's early style of filmmaking with a first person narative and a interesting preambe to the movie, which is a history of witches that lasts about 7 minutes! and that's in a 59 minute movie!.  the prints on these movies are not too bad and the later movie from the 1970's looks the best.  These are very low budget movies made far away from any professional studio town, but they have their own primitive charm.  Hopefully many of the other movies like 'swamp girl' that are featured in the trailers  will get released someday by 'something wierd" as well.  These are not good traditional movies but they are ok low bugdet cult horror films from way down south and that's good enough.
