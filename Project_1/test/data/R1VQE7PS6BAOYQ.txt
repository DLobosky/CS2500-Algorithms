But there are only a bare handful of books in print in English that focuses on the air portion of this critical 1942 campaign on the Eastern Front.  The only other book of note published recently is author Joel Hayward's "Stopped at Stalingrad".  So while this review will focus Mr Bergstrom's book, I will also compare/contrast it a bit to "Stopped at Stalingrad".In early 1942, the Soviets had attacked and encircled German forces at Kholm and Demyansk.  The book opens with describing the successful airlifts that the Germans were able to organize ... a success which would set the stage for the German resupply attempt at Stalingrad later in the year.  He then covers the air battles in the Crimea, the disastrous Soviet attack at Kharkov, and the following German attacks toward the Caucasus and toward Stalingrad, the battle for and encirclement of Stalingrad, and the aftermaths, from both the Soviet and German perspectives.This book itself is relatively slender, 144 pages cover to cover, but this is offset by the fact that it's in a relatively large 8 inch by 12 inch format, so you're actually getting a lot of information.  It's chock full of excellent photographs, tables, maps, and illustrations.Comparing and contrasting this book with "Stopped at Stalingrad", this book, "Stalingrad: The Air Battle: 1942-January 1943" covers both the German and Soviet efforts ("Stopped at Stalingrad focuses more on the Germans), has more technical details, analysis of the opposing forces, orders of battle, and copious anecdotes from both sides.  Mr Bergstrom also provides more insight and analysis as to why the forces performed as they did, and often (though not always) cross-checks aircraft claims versus losses for both sides during the battle, something I liked.  One of the interesting things that Mr Bergstrom points out was that a relative handful of German fighter aces (experten) shot down a large percentage of the Soviet aircraft that were lost.  The steady attrition of these aces appeared to have a huge impact on the German's ability to maintain air superiority over the course of the campaign, in my opinion."Stopped at Stalingrad" presents an excellent analysis of the German position prior to the start of Case Blue and a more nuanced and detailed view of the German air and ground operations themselves over the course of the campaign, though at the expense of the Soviet position.  A lot of the anecdotes in "Stopped in Stalingrad" are from Wolfram von Richthofen's diary, whereas those in ""Stalingrad: The Air Battle: 1942-January 1943" come from a multitude of sources.  (Both books "feature" von Richthofen to a large degree, as he had a huge impact on the air war.)  But neither book is deficient relative to the other ... they just have differing points of view.I highly recommend this book.  It provides good information and analysis on the air forces of both sides during a critical campaign on the Eastern Front.  If you're trying to decide whether to get this book or "Stopped at Stalingrad", I'd get them both, as the two books are somewhat complementary, in my opinion, and when read together, provide a comprehensive view of the role of that the German and Soviet Air Forces played in outcome of the battles.
