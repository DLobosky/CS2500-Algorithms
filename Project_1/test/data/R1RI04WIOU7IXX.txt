Everything seemed great. Considering everything, the price is fair. At about 40 lbs, this TV can be mounted anywhere. It has 3 HDMI ports and 1 USB port. The brown colored strip along the bottom didn't deter me.The box was missing the remote, hardware and manual. It looked to me like it had been taped shut a couple times before. With a fouled order, I returned it. I just got an LG DVD player, the one intended to be used with this TV. I still like LG products in general.This is just my experience and it was probably a matter of bad luck.
