Writer-director John Keitel's debut feature is an earnest, likeable portrait of campus life where  conformity is the norm and gay students are implicitly discouraged from finding their true identity. However, the underwritten script stumbles badly over a number of crucial scenes, which means the intended dramatic sparks never really ignite, and the performances are merely OK. That said, characters are sympathetic and the narrative still has a lot of social relevance. Ultimately, the film's heart is in the right place and it works  on its own modest level.
