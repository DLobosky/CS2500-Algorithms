EdgeWe all know what Shawn Michaels is capable of, and when you put Edge in a match with a talented guy, you're going to see a very good much. All Shawn Michaels matches are kind've similar but nonetheless this match was a fun watch and a great way to kick off the show.Undertaker v. John Heidenreich in a Casket MatchAlthough not a bad match, this was certainly the weakest match on the card, probably saved only by the fact that it was a gimmick match. Heidenreich is a mediocre wrestler, and the Undertaker isnt quite the presence he once was. But this was a very violent match and fairly enjoyable to watch.JBL (C) v. Big Show v. Kurt AngleI always find triple threat matches to hold alot of excitement, and Kurt Angle almost always puts on a very good match. Granted, neither the Big Show nor JBL are especially good wrestlers, Angle carried them through a respectable match, with, albiet, a predictable ending.Triple H (C) v. Randy OrtonThis was another solid match with a predictable outcome. For all the complaints about it, Triple H is still one of the best wrestlers in the business and Randy Orton looks great when he works with someone talented. Not much to complain about here except for the predictability.2005 Royal Rumble MatchThe main event was one of the best Royal Rumble's in recent times, featuring some humorous moments, alot of great wrestling but unfortunately a predictable ending (notice the theme here?). The match started out great with Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero, and Rey Mysterio and Edge carrying the Final Four. Once the match got down to Batista and John Cena it got a little dull, as Cena only looks good with an exceptional wrestler, and Batista is good, but not amazing.Overall, this was a very good event. If you're looking for surprises, though, this isnt the Royal Rumble for you. Every match except maybe the Michaels-Edge match was easily predicted. Despite this, there was alot of excitement, and this is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of the Royal Rumble.
