But I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed by the time I reached the end. The book just didn't hold my interest very well. I don't really know how to rate this book. There were some things about it I really liked and others I found disturbing. First, the good things. I really liked the author's vulnerablity and conversational writing style. It reminded me of sitting with a close friend over dinner and talking. I respect the author's honesty. The author includes a lot of very thought-provoking quotes about prayer. I love the fact that the author is so upfront about her own struggles and her willingness to admit she is still learning and growing in the area of prayer. Now, the things I didn't like so much. The Bible has a lot to say about prayer, but you wouldn't know that from reading this book. In fact, I found it strange that the author didn't delve more into the Bible's teachings on prayer. After all, shouldn't that be our ultimate authority on prayer? Second, the author is very fond of quoting Mother Theresa. The author of this book also seems to assume (as do many other evangelicals today) that Mother Theresa was a Christian. But anyone who does any indepth research on Mother Theresa will find this is not the case. Mother Theresa very much supported the idea of "it doesn't matter what you believe. All religions lead to God" that is not even close to what Scripture teaches. The author also mistakenly assumes that Catholicism is just another Christian denomination. Now, before anyone goes accusing me of being an anti-Catholic bigot, let me say that is not the case. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended Catholic mass for 18 years. I can tell you from experience that Roman Catholicism teaches salvation by works and believes only Catholics are going to Heaven.  They do not consider anyone outside the Church to be a Christian. In fact, if a person says that they are saved by grace alone (which the Bible teaches) they can be expelled permanently from the Catholic Church. Also, the majority of my family on my mom's side (who I am extremely close to) are almost all Catholic. I do not agree with their beliefs and no longer consider myself Catholic, but that does not change my love for my family in anyway. It grieves me when I read things like this book which assumes that Catholics are already Christian and don't need to be evangelized.But this is a very common misconception among evangelicals. Even among prominant Christian leaders such as James Dobson and Chuck Colson. There are many others as well.  Now, I am not saying there are no Christians in the Catholic Church. I believe there are some. But based on conversations with others who were raised Catholic, most people who ended up finding a saving relationship with Christ end up severing ties with the Catholic Church. The author of this book believes all Catholics are Christians. She says so plainly when talking about her son in law who left the Catholic Church for Islam. The book "A Woman Rides the Beast" does an excellent job on digging into and supporting from Catholic documents what the Catholic church actually teaches. I also have a problem with the fact that the author seems to think that prayer has to be long, involved and eloquent. I don't believe this to be true. Prayer can be long, or it can be something as simple as "God, help me." I happen to believe that it is not the length of the prayer that matters. It is the attitude of the heart and the level of honesty. God wants us to be brutally honest with Him in prayer. He is not impressed how many words we use. I also found this book to be too long and very slow moving. I had a hard time getting through it. It just didn't hold my interest. There are many wonderful books on Prayer. EM Bounds and Andrew Murray are two that come to mind. But there are many others. If you truly want to learn how to pray, skip this book and pick up one of them.
