I like a few ABBA songs and don't consider myself a fan, so for me, Elisabeth Vincentelli's entry in the 33 1/3 series brought some new light onto this group.  Although it is a book about a greatest hits album, Ms. Vincentelli goes into the recording of each of the albums the hits were taken.  Despite being known as more a campy group, ABBA were craftsmen in the studio and the endurance of the music is nicely detailed.
