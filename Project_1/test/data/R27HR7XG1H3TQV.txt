This dice is made on the same principle as D10s just with more kites, now off course with this the kites are thinner but I think it works well to read which kite is on top even if it is rather small. One thing that can the a problem however is that this is a big, heavy dice it can be a bit cumbersome to roll properly so that it is a 50/50 chance of witch side of the raised part in the middle it lands on and not just rolling it so you get a random number on one of the sides but not the other.I do not know to many uses for a D34, if anyone have any ideas I would love to hear them, basically this is good for charts, random encounter lists and so on where you might have used a D100 but who only have 30 something listed items, it can also be used to determine which day of a long trip something happens, or witch planet your spaceship crashes on if there are 34 planets in the system, or as a reward for players, letting them roll a higher dice then usual for a change to get a better result, and so on and so on, but all in all this dice is rather useless, it do however look good and is fun to have in your dice bag as a conversation starter.This is a pretty piece of orange plastic with numbers on it, it works fairly well as a dice but have limited uses in most RPG games. However the dice looks so cool I am tempted to make a game that uses it for my RPG group just to have an excuse to take this dice out of the bag more often and get it in a few more colors. All in all this is a fun collectors item but not much more, however it is fairly cheap so I recommend it.
