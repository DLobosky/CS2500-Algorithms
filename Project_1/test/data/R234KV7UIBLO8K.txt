I am SO disappointed in Dean Koontz with Lost Souls.  It is as if he has sold out to the publishing houses to get as many books out of one story line as possible. This could have been a great though long book (ala H. Potter) and been worth while but Koontz chose to introduce the characters,set up the plot and then end it at the climax.  Puh-Leeez! Sadly, I have no desire to wait around for the next book just for it to end before it should.  Sadly, this is the last Koontz book I read. :(
