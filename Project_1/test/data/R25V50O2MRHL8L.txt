Why I read it:  First of all let me say that the cover of this book is gorgeous.  That alone intrigued me.  The synopsis for this story seemed interesting.  I had seen it on Amazon and wanted to give it a try.What I liked:  I really liked that there were two stories going on at the same time.  The book would go between present day to 1250 B.C.  Both stories seemed to be separate from each other yet connected.  I liked Kreios.  A strong warrior who just happened to be one of the Sons of God, an angel.  It is his story that is told along with Airel's.  Airel is a normal teenage girl who loves her coffee.  Her life seems to set out on a course of change the moment she meets Michael Alexander.  He is the new guy that draws Airel in.  She starts to notice that her skin is becoming clear of blemishes, she heals rather quickly, and her hair needs little prep.  She doesn't quite understand all the changes but it all becomes clear to her by the end.  She has to question the things she has accepted as truth and the people in her life.  Airel is something special.What I didn't like:  Although I liked the story I found myself becoming bored with so much story telling.  I like the characters to engage a little bit more.  A lot of what is learned throughout the story comes from the thoughts of the characters and not their interaction with each other.  The story seemed a bit long to me because of this reason.  I wanted to read it and see how it all played out but I found my mind wandering as the characters were telling me things that were happening.  Another thing that bothered me was Michael and Airel.  Throughout the story Airel is going on about Michael being her one true love.  I just didn't buy it.  Yeah I know she kept telling me, the reader, but I never truly saw it.As I was reading there were a few things that irked me and I have explained that already.  But after finishing the book I look back and see that I liked the story.  It has the classic good vs. evil vibe going on.  Also the author rewarded me for the time I put into reading this book by giving a great twist at the end of the story.  I must say I didn't see it coming.  I do recommend this story but I do caution the reader to be prepared for a lot of storytelling.*I received a copy for honest review
