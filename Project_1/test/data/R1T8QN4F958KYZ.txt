Several months pass before Gerry is introduced to Anthony Blake (Ben Lyon), the author of her favourite new book, "Obey Thy Impulse".  Sparks fly and pretty soon Gerry and Anthony are engaged.  Complications arise when Gerry's younger sister Joan (Barbara Kent) returns from her European holiday with a fiancee...none other than Jim!  Gerry, a "modern girl with an old-fashioned conscience", is faced with confessing her messy prior  relationship to Joan, and decides that she must also reveal Jim's true colours.  But just how far will she go to protect her sister?This fast-paced romantic comedy displays Gloria Swanson in a new light.  So many of her silent and early talkie roles cast her as the dramatic tragedienne, so having her in a light piece like INDISCREET is like a breath of fresh air.  She even gets to sing!  Keep an eye out for Maude Eburne as the comical Aunt Kate.For a movie from 1931, Alpha has tried to make the dilapidated picture quality more presentable (the picture is very sharp), even tweaking the Main Title sequence so that we can properly read the names of those concerned.  That said, there are still many jumps and cuts in picture and sound, and some scenes are barely audible with the worn-out soundtrack.  It's a shame because INDISCREET is a joy of a movie.(Single-sided, single-layer disc)
