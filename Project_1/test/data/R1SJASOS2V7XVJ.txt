To be perfectly honest, I was expecting this movie to be very poor.  After six films, what other stoylines could the writers come up with?  But, I liked &quot;Halloween H20&quot; alot.  The only reason that I didn't give it five out of five stars was because of the absence of the late, great Donald Pleasence (Dr. Sam Loomis.)
