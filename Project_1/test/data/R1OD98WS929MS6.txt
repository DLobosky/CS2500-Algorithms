I have also seen people close to me struggle with this disorder.  Therefore, I am always excited to see something fresh that sheds light on this often neglected disorder whatever name you want to put to it.What is MOST valuable about this book is that it gives an INSIDE perspective on BPD.  Most of what is written on the subject describes it from the OUTSIDE.  This is invaluable for anyone confronting this problem, living with someone who has BPD tendencies and especially the average psychotherapist.  In short, it's an extremely vulnerable and intimate account that sheds light on the type of distorted thinking, feeling and meaning making that can occur.  Among other things, this must have taken incredible courage and I can't even imagine anyone would right a book like this except out of extreme compassion.This is a rather long book, but I honestly couldn't put it down.  It takes the reader inside the head and heart of the BPD sufferer.  It uses story like good fiction to illustrate situations and important points and in this sense it's like good fiction except it's real!  If you are confused about what goes on inside the mind of someone with BPD... this is a very good starting point for understanding the overwhelming feelings of emptiness, impulsiveness, etc.  It also develops the consequences of acting out, the different dilemmas that arise as fallout, etc.I can't praise this book enough, I'm so glad someone took the time to write it.  If you are suffering from BPD or a loved one is.... it's a MUST own book.  It will also inspire you and show you what the path forward looks like.  While it's true BPD is a stubborn problem, it is also true that we have never known more about it than we do now and there really are effective therapies and medication out there.  However, I think the most important ingredient is love and above all this is a story of great love and commitment from key people in the patient's life.There are other excellent BPD resources available on Amazon.  If you are reading this review, I'm sure you would also want to own Sometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorder.  This is the best SINGLE book on the topic that I am aware of.  Also, if you are a therapist, consider... Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder.  This is a good starting point for clients, therapists and family alike.In the past BPD was considered hopeless or virtually so.  Now, however, we know a lot more about the brain, treating this disorder, etc.  However, not every therapist is talented at working with it.  You need to find someone who is effective.  Therefore, doing your homework is essential.  If you are a concerned family member stuck in the middle, then you may find Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care about Has Borderline Personality Disorder and Breaking Free from Boomerang Love: Getting Unhooked from Borderline Personality Disorder Relationships.  The latter of these two focuses on intimate relationships.  It's tone is a bit sarcastic at times, but you will learn a lot too.Finally, I would recommend the following:  Lost in the Mirror, 2nd Edition: An Inside Look at Borderline Personality Disorder.  This is another VERY GOOD and concise inside look at BPD with more structure.  It is written with compassion and would definitely be something you might enjoy reading along with this book or after it.  I also like The Narcissistic and Borderline Disorders: An Integrated Developmental Approach as one potential developmental model for therapists.  In general, psychodynamic and dialectical behavioral approaches seem to work the best.  I also like Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Of Borderline Patients.  There are also many new books out there that you are probably aware of, but these older ones still have much to offer in terms of providing a broad perspective.
