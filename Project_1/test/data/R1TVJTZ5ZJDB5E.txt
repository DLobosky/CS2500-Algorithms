I purchased this card for my Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Pink) and my  Sanyo Xacti VPC-E2 Digital Camcorder and 8 MP Digital Camera). Now I can take about 8000+ pictures depending on the size and quality of the image and be able to record hours of videos.  No need to have additional smaller capacity SD cards laying around getting lost now.Make sure to get a card reader such as the Transcend TS-RDM3K All in 1 USB 2.0 Multi Card Reader (Black). Makes it easier to view and upload photos/videos from the card instead of hooking up the camera to your PC via cables.
