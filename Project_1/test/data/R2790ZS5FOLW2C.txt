I got mine for $69.99 online, which is strange because Amazon usually has the best or equal to the best prices.  Anyway, the following is for the 3380: If you are on a budget and want a good camera backpack, think about getting this one. Although it's not waterproof, I am at a loss to know what a $269 backpack would have over this one. You can buy aerosol spray waterproofing media in shoe supply stores that would probably do the trick (spray without equipment in backpack ; )  Maybe for difficult treks, the pricey ones have advantages, but I've carried mine through Costa Rica and Panama without any trouble. The shoulder straps are thick and comfortable and it lies smoothly on the back as you walk. The middle compartment carries my laptop. Here's what I carry:1 Nikon D2001 Nikon D40with two zoom lenses; one 50mm prime lens1 laptop1 AC laptop adaptorLoads of extra batteries, filters, doo-dads, and dad-doos.
