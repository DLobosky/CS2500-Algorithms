This soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It reminds me of other great scores such as "The Rock" by Harry Gregson-Williams/Hans Zimmer, "Armageddon" by Trevor Rabin, "Gladiator" and "Crimson Tide" by Hans Zimmer, and "National Treasure" by Trevor Rabin. If you like any of these soundtracks at all, you are guaranteed to enjoy this one as well. The mixture of various scores fits the movie extremely well, and leaves you with a great feeling of satisfaction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
