I have all of these, the 160, 170, 180's and the MX W1 earbuds.These Work great! Got them paired with the 170's base unit. I can NOT tell the difference in quality between this headset and the 170's. These will also have BASS and Surround when paired to the 170's base~!!!On another note, When paired to the same base unit, ALL the headset volumes will be effected when changing the volume on any headset EXCEPT these. These work independently and if you're using multiple units paired to the same base, these are the ones you MUST HAVE. A BEST BUY.
