She shows not only how irrational the current left-wing philosophy is, but also how it is now morally bankrupt, especially compared with &quot;the old left&quot;.  Despite the colossal failure of socialism time and time again, modern liberals- to this day- continue to idealize it, even the horrors of the former Soviet Union.  Just look at the book &quot;In Denial: Historians, Communism, &amp; Espionage&quot; by John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr.Please note that this title has been replaced by Ayn Rand's &quot;Return of the Primitive&quot; which contains all the material from this book, plus additional essays by both Ayn Rand and a contemporary Objectivist.
