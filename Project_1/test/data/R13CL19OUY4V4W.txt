Although this is their first film together since Titanic, this film is nothing at all like Tiatnic. They alone save this absolutely pitifully directed and edited film. It's very easy to overlook the mess this director made of this film because these two actors are genius.Revolutionary Road is set in the 1950's, a post war era where men were hunter gathers, and women were housewives. Production nailed the era with the sets, clothes, and hair styles. In the opening montage, Frank meets April at a party, they start talking, and the film cuts away to them married and living in a house. The story is about how they fall in and out of love. We get a sense that both have a bit of bohemian in them. This is what April falls in love with. When life became routine and she realizes Frank hates his job; she comes up with the idea to leave it all, pack up the two kids, sell the house, cash in their savings, and move to Paris. The rest of the film is about how they both cope with the choices to go or stay.Just to reiterate, the most remarkable part of this film - the performances by these two actors. It was simply amazing to me. The Horrible of this film. Sam Mendes cannot direct to save his soul. American Beauty (American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)) and Jarhead (Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)) were random luck. He has also hired an editor that has absolutely no idea of how to edit a film. The biggest evil, Mendes chose to place every speaking character dead center in the film. In film language, this is the equivalent of making Passport pictures over and over and over. There is a strength and weakness and tension built by placing characters in different parts of the frame - Mendes chose to ignore this standard film language. The camera work goes from rock solid excellent shots; to horrible handheld nonsense with no practical reason why they went handheld. The editing. The film is almost 2 hours long. There was a creative rhythm built early on - time skipped way forward, details were missed, but the viewer could fill those in. There were also a series of flashbacks creatively placed to help understand the motivations at that moment in the film. About 45 minutes into the film, this whole rhythm is lost. The film moves into standard soap opera melodrama shot and reaction editing. In the deleted scenes, shows an exterior shot of the great big living room window that would have been early in the film. This shot would have foretold the ending, and made that ending much more powerful. He missed a huge moment - the critical moment near the end where April stands in front that window as an interior shot. The missing book end shot was simply inexcusable. There's more deleted scenes that establish the story line much better, but were left off. There are many scenes that were useless in the actual film that could have been easily deleted. Those deleted scenes would have maintained the rhythm of the film. The film is rated R. Mostly strong language and one scene where bare breasts are visible for 0.1 seconds (not Kate Winslet). The strong language was critical to the story. The bare breasts were totally unnecessary. There is no violence (DiCaprio punches a car several times). The DVD includes deleted scenes that should actually be in the film.Watch this for the performances. Winslet is gorgeous. DiCaprio is outstanding.
