But this year's was great.Shawn Michaels vs. EdgeThought they was going to save this match for Mania, guess I was wrong. Edge and Michaels have a nice match to start off the show. Edge wins this one. I have to say best pay per view opener so far this year. Rating: ***Casket MatchUndertaker vs. HeidenreichOkay match, gets boring in the middle sometimes. This is Taker and Heidenreigh's best match in their feud. Luckily, this is a gimmick match. The apperences made this match though, Snitsky comming out to help Heidenreigh and Kane poping out the casket to help/save Taker. Taker tombstones Heidenreigh and puts him in the casket for the win. Rating: **WWE ChampionshipTriple-Threat MatchJBL vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big ShowNice match, everytime Kurt and Big Show are in triple threat matches together, they give good performances. I was into this match the whole time. Love the spot where Kurt hits the tv on Big Show's head to make him fall threw the annoucers table. Ending has JBL get back in the ring to give Kurt the clothesline from hell to win this one. Rating: ***World Heavyweight Championship Triple H vs. Randy OrtonNot a great match, but not a bad one either. I have to say at least it was better than their Unforgiven match last year. Near the end of this match it actually looked like Orton had a concussion. Triple H gets the win and this time by himself without any help from Flair or Batista, which is good. Rating: ** 1/2Royal Rumble Match (15 Raw superstars, 15 Smackdown superstars and 30 total).You should all know that every year the Royal Rumble is entertaining to me. There were a LOT of moments (comedy moments are included also). Daniel Puder just got OWNED by Holly, Eddie and Benoit at the start of the Rumble. In the middle of the match Raw guys team up (same goes with Smackdown guys) to fight each other. Funniest moment in the Rumble HAS to be when EVERYONE in the Rumble jumped Muhammad Hassan. I loved it also when Kurt Angle came in and just clean house on everyone. Shame he went over the ropes after a couple of minutes he been in it. I'm glad WWE started to build the Kurt vs Shawn Michaels match that's going to happen at Mania 21 from here with Angle beating the mess out of HBK after throwing him out. The ending of this match had Batista and Cena (the last two left in the match go at it )with both men going over the rope (they could of left that part out) but they restarted the match and Batista won it. Good Rumble, lame/okay ending. Rating: ****The extras have a little more this time with a couple of Royal Rumble promos for matches (commericals). The build-up vids for the Rumble match and the Triple-Threat match, they also show what happens after the Rumble, Teddy Long giving Batista a contract and the JBL interview that was shown on Raw the next day. So, this is a pretty good DVD to own and one of the better WWE pay per view's so far.
