This premise that we will soon be able to dictate our genes and hence will be able to discriminate on genes was also scary as it is now a clear a present possibility as well.  The deleted scene which showed how using this criteria to decide who gets born and who doesn't would have deprived us of Abraham Lincoln, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein etc was also very powerful and really should have been left in the original film.  This was also the first film that introduced me to Jude Law and it showed me just how good an actor he was even way back then.  Being a fan of noir I couldn't help but feel its influence on this film as well.  This blu-ray version is a real treat for fans as it looks great in 1080p and sounds great in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The special feature documentaries are also decent making this to date the definitive version of a great sci-fi film.  Highly recommended!
