I'm glad I did, it makes it much more attractive than just having a solid pink netbook.The skin is very high quality.  I isn't just a paper sticker like some other skins.  It is good vinyl that takes the shape of the computer and looks like it was always there.  It was easy to apply and the channeling of the glue really does keep it from capturing air bubbles.  It did get some wrinkles around the bottom of the hinge that I couldn't get out, but it isn't really noticable.I'm definitely glad I got this skin, and it is well worth the money.  I also got one to match my Kindle and it is equally good.
