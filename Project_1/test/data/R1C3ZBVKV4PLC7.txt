I remember renting this movie with a friend when I was around ten years old, and it was a lot of fun and scary as hell. Unlike some of the other horror movies that featured monsters or aliens as the nemesis, the concept of Critters was pretty original, and although it's not award material, it's a pretty decent sci-fi/horror film.Don't go into this thinking that it's another "Leprechaun" or "Jack Frost" type of film. The film isn't about gore and despite the absurdity at how the Critters look on the cover, they are pretty scary in the film.
