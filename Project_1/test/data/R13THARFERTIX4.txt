It must say "Sold by Amazon.com").I've had this Sony Blu-ray player for about 2 weeks.  Lots of people are complaining about load times, eject times, etc.  I decided to investigate so I downloaded the latest firmware which as of this writing was release on Dec 20, 2007. The download unpacks itself nicely to the drive of your choice.  It was amazingly easy to burn to a CD using Nero which had already recognized the file as a ISO and burned it as an image.  My player had firmware version 2.60 previously installed.  Before loading the firmware disc into the player, I wanted to test the loading times that have been the subject of so much discussion.  From a cold power on to the Blu-ray logo screen, it took 1:30.  It then took 35 seconds to play the movie (Terminator 2).  After installing the latest firmware (version 3.70), the power on-to-Blu-ray logo time lowered to 50 sec - 1 minute. It took about the same time to play the movie as before - 35 to 40 seconds.  Ejecting the disc was instant - about 2 seconds. Once the player is on, all movies ejected and loaded after that are faster loading - anywhere from 25 to 40 seconds.  All in all, I think these are VERY REASONABLE TIMES.  Keep in mind that even Toshiba's HD DVD players takes a little time to do these same functions.  As long as companies like Sony are committed to constantly updating it's equipment via firmware, it's a beautiful thing! I will be renting Blu-ray movies from Netfix to continue testing.  The first one I rented was from a nearby Blockbuster.  It's worth noting the Blu-ray discs have a protective undercoating. My Terminator 2 disc wasn't showing a single scratch!  UPDATE: I also just received a Blu-ray disc of "300" from Netflix.  It too has not a single scratch underneath after hundreds of rentals.  This is a HUGE feature of the Blu-ray disc standard.I must say "Terminator 2" has to be one of the WORST looking films in Hi-def.  The quality of the film appears to be rather poor, a bit soft and lacking the fine detail of some films older than it. It seems to be more obvious in darker scenes more than daylight scenes.  In fact the movie's main menu is the best looking part about the disc. If you want to see what blu-ray can do, the is NOT the movie to rent or buy! The player itself looks and feels traditional Sony solid right down to the remote control.  Nothing flimsy here.  No cheap plastic buttons or doors.  The unit feels a little heavier than the Toshiba HD DVD players too.I have tried regular DVDs like "Troy" and I can see a big difference with the upconverted picture set to your choice of 720p, 1080i, or 1080p. You can cycle through each resolution output as the movie is playing to see the before and after.  It does indeed work and improve the picture of standard DVDs.  I don't have a 1080p HDTV but it's OK. At least I'm ready for the future in the event I do upgrade but I'm amazined even by 1080i HD clarity.  It's more than good enough.  There is no pixelation of fast moving objects as there is on TV station broadcasts.The power and eject buttons are on top front corners of the unit.  They are large buttons and very cleverly separated from all the other buttons in front.  Very unique touch! Yes, it would have been nice if Sony was throwing in a few movies like Toshiba has been nice enough to do but you have to ask yourself, "Am I interested in the player itself and what it offers, or the things that may be included with the player?"  At least you can get 5 free Blu-ray titles later via the mail-in form. A HDMI cable is not included but neither does Toshiba include it with its current HD DVD players.  I just got a cable from Ebay for $10 including shipping. You DO NOT need expensive cables like Monster brand! Digital is digital!I'm also not here to say which HD disc format is better.  I'm just reviewing this particular model.
