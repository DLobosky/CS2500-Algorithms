This is a fine WWII movie that shows the bravery of American soldiers in the face of so much horror, chaos, and hardship of war. World War II was hell, but it was a necessary hell in which decent people were forced to give up some part of their humanity in order to stop an enemy that was really determined to wipe out the free world. This film is about showing respect to those who risk their lives in order to make this a better and more peaceful world.The middle part of the movie is a little bit weak and overlong; I do believe the director and screenwriters could have done a better job with that part of the movie.The movie does show how unpredictable, chaotic, and dangerous warfare is, and how the GREATEST award for any soldier is trying to survive all of that. For those people who criticize that this movie is not always 100% accurate, please keep in mind this is a fictional WWII movie; it is NOT suppose to be a documentary about D-DAY or how soldiers fight in a war.P.S.For those who still doubt the plausibility of some of the movie's events, you may want to look at Stephen Ambrose's books BAND OF BROTHERS (US 101st Airborne Unit), D-DAY JUNE 6, 1944 (interviews with American, British, Canadian, French, and German veterans of D-DAY) and his other books. Some of the movie's events were taken from these books.And for those who believe the movie's ending is implausible, you can read the book  STEEL INFERNO (written by Michael Reynolds, a retired British officer who is an expert on German panzer tactics) on pages 130-131, Chapter 11, it tells about an incident that took place at Villers-Bocage, France (6/13/1944) that is ALMOST similar to what see in the movie ending.
