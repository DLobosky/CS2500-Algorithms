James Chatters is a professional forensic anthropologist, paleoecologist, and archeologist working in Washington state.  As such he became involved in the recent finding of the so-called Kennewick Man and the political furor over the disposition of the remains.   The book is an in-depth discussion of almost every aspect of the discovery:  the initial find, the socio-political conflict over it, the brief analysis of the remains, and the overall enlightment that it casts on human migrations.For Native American activists the issue  was one of yet another example of dispossession of by those of European descent, this time  in the name of science.  For "science" here read the "manifest destiny" of the 19th century proponents of the westward expansion that led to a systematic, almost Hitleresque genocide of the indigenous inhabitants of the continent.  The active political voices of the Native American activists since the 1960s had led to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in the 1990s, and the discovery of the skeletal remains of an early American eroded from a river bank in 1996 put the laws to a critical test, one that is still yet to be settled.  For the scientists the issue was of information irretrievably lost to the store of human knowledge about the past.  For this issue read "truth" forever vanquished by the "superstition" of the dark side. Certainly in a time when the validity of science education is challenged by every Tom, Dick and Harry with an opinion, when the average person is unable to think critically, when the media are rife with occult nonsense, and when "reality" TV occupies whole evenings of family time one can hardly blame them for suspecting as much!  For myself, I find the research into the human past to be an intriguing pursuit.  I read Dr. Chatter's book in about a day, hanging on every word.  I have to admit, though, that most of my friends and co-workers consider me an eccentric, so I know for a fact that not every one holds my high opinion of this field of endeavor.  I can therefore see why Native American people, given their history with their European neighbors, might consider the analysis of the Kennewick remains as a dangerous effort to once again dispossess them, this time of what they consider to be their history and right of priority in the land.  The book brings into sharp relief that the confrontation was due to two groups of people each approaching the world with their own view and lacking understanding of the perspective of the other. It also points out, just as the brewhaha over the Ice Man in Europe did, just how much a part politics, ego, and media involvement has to do with disputes of this sort.  One can only hope that in the future, scientists and Native American groups can work together with greater accord.  Certainly what was discovered about the Kennewick man gave me more respect for the closeness of the global human population and for the successful adaptation of the early American people to a difficult set of circumstances.One of the most interesting things I found from the discussion of the remains of the Kennewick specimen is that the human populations living today are more like one another than they are like their distant predecessors.  In short, human evolution, at least on a superficial level, is on-going.  Our decedents several thousand years hence will also be different.  This was a riveting and well written book.
