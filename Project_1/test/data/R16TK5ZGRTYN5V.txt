

The Amazon Editorial Review is incorrect and misleading.  The included CD does not offer guidance on two of the fifteen arrangements.  No instruction on either "Strawberry Fields" or "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is given.  Since those two pieces are the sole reason I bought the book, I am very disappointed.
