I just couldn't imagine a were-rat being an interesting romantic lead.  The author, however, revealed some surprising details to Wilson's character and made him so lovable.  Combined that with his mate, Kim's character, and the two made an irrisistable romance story. This book also reveals more about the world of the Immortal Ops and their enemies.  You don't have to read the previous books in my opinion to keep up with the characters but if you do start with this one, I think you'll want to read all of them.All the characters including the women in the past books are in this story.  The story is full of action and fast paced.  As with the other books, the sex scenes are explicit.  These books do not have in depth studies of the emotional aspects of the romantic characters.  If you're looking for that type of book, I don't think you'll like this series.  If, however, you are just looking for a fun read with characters that are very likeable, this is the series for you.I can't wait for this author to publish the next book in this series.  I hope it's about Eadan although I wouldn't mind it being about Jon either.
