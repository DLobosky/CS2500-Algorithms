There was some potential for sure but I just couldn't stay interested. Like the other reviewers said...soooo boring and painfully slow. I'm glad I wasn't the only one - I started to think maybe I just wasn't 'getting it'. With Gary Oldman in there, I was really hoping for something along the lines of 'The Contender' - which I highly recommend and has tremendous replay value. I think I've seen The Contend at least six times.Anyway, I'd pass on this... IMHO
