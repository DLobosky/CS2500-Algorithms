The following units introduce pitch and its relationship to the underlying harmony. Melodies are first derived from a single chord than over richer chord progressions and bass lines. Modal devices and the use of arpeggios to buildand expand ideas is explored. Along with this focus on the "micro" elements, later units demonstrate the larger sections and ultimately complete song forms.The accompanying CD is well-produced and illustrates all of the exercises.As with the companion book on Harmony, the vocabulary here is rock and guitar-oriented and you won't find many jazz/show tune techniques here nor Steely Dan-type changes (I'd recommend Jack Perricone's "Melody in Songwriting" which is a bit more along those lines and makes a great followup to this series.)  But otherwise, there's little prior knowledge assumed (other than an interest in and listening experience to a wide range of songs) and much to be learned.
