This piece is even more beautiful in person.  You can't really see the detail until you see it in person.  Wonderful piece and I have to say that Gem Avenue is a wonderful company to do business with.  Another company sent us the incorrect item we ordered and it was a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law.  The other company also blew us off and didn't answer multiple emails to them about THEIR mistake.  So on Dec. 20th we had to rush to find another gift for Xmas and we found it here at Gem Avenue and ordered 2 beautiful items.  We ordered this pendant but also the beautiful matching earrings and we got them by Dec. 24th without having to pay extra shipping to get them here in time for Xmas.  The items were a big hit with my mother-in-law and with us.  They were beautiful and Gem Avenue has our business for life.  They cared enough to make sure that even though we were ordering these items just 4 days before Xmas, we got them for Xmas and without the extra expense of having to pay more on shipping to assure Xmas delivery.  To me that is a quality company who cares about it's product and it's customers.  We are now Gem Avenue customers for life and so should you all be.  A company that cares in this day and age is a company to stick with because you can't go wrong with them.  So thank you from the bottom of our hearts Gem Avenue for going the extra mile for a customer in need and saving Xmas for all of us.  We certainly do appreciate you.
