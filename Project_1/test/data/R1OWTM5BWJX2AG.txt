It follows the wonderful Money, and the Law of Attraction: Learning to Attract Wealth, Health, and Happiness. (FYI...the fourth book is about Spirituality, and the Law of Attraction.)The crux of Abraham's teaching: "The basis of life is freedom; the results f life is expansion--and the purpose of life is joy."This book is about creating joyful relationships. The book is divided into 6 parts; all but the last address how to bring joy into relations. *	Learning how to bring joy into the different types of relationships we have (coworkers, friends, government, etc.)*	Finding and attracting the erfect mate*	Sexuality*	Parenting--creating positive, joyful relations with children*	Self appreciation--discover your true self and learn awareness of your Vibrational Vortex of Creation. *	Transcript of Abraham To understand your relationships, you go into the vortex.  "The Vortex is the place in which you feel good about yourself. It is the place in which you are closest to 'Source. 'Source' energy is like a vortex of good feelings, of liquid love (as Abraham puts it) of peace and wellbeing, joy - everything that we naturally are."  To access the vortex, you do things that make you feel good. It is in the space of the vortex that the law of attraction takes hold--your good feelings will guide you to other people with good feelings and WHAM...stuff starts happening like you meet your soul mate! "You must make what you want a more dominant part of your Vibration than what you have; once you are consistently doing that, what you want and what you will have will intertwine, and you will be living your desire."When we are in alignment--in the vortex--we draw all good things to us--people, situations, etc. It's a win-win. Once we are in alignment with our Source, we connect with our higher selves; with the God within us. The key to getting inside the Vibrational Vortex of Creation is to be in the state of appreciation of self.Ultimately, The Vortex guides us through the exercises that will make us feel good about ourselves and our relationships. I am an interior designer specializing in Feng Shui, and I have practiced the law of attraction for years and have helped numerous clients of mine manifest their desires using the LOA. As I did in my review of MONEY, I highly recommend the award winning book HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT: BEAUTIFY, DETOXIFY & ENERGIZE YOUR LIFE, YOUR HOME & YOUR PLANET along with The Vortex, for a few more secrets to finding and keeping love and relationships strong.  Finally, the original The Law of Attraction is still a terrific primer. Ester and Jerry Hicks have written a clear and easy to follow guide to help you live your higher purpose. Highly recommend!
