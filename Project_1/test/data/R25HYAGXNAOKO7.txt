Those are useful for all-in-one storage, a serve as a good place to keep your GPS between trips.  But they're useless when you're on the road, want to head into a restaurant for a meal, but don't want to leave your GPS out in the car.  This case is the perfect answer.For me the lanyard was useless, and got discarded immediately.  I take the case on trips, and whenever I leave the car, I clip it to my belt and slip the NUVI inside.  I just slide the power cord, and beanbag-like "Garmin portable friction mount" (a must-have item for NUVIs, much better than a suction cup on your windshield) out of sight under my seat.  This is simple, painless, cheap, and easy, and ensures my Garmin will be at hand whenever I need it.  The case is high quality and durable.  If you are looking for a way to take your GPS with you outside of the car, this case is the best I've found.
