After using it a few times, I was really unnerved about passing it onto her - in my opinion, this is not a DVD for the untrained dancer, and it's also not for the casual fan of Dancing with the Stars. To Julianne's credit, this is definitely a great cardio workout - it will get you drenched it sweat by the mid-point and is easily the best cardio workout I've gotten from a dance DVD.The weaknesses of this DVD are twofold. The first is the fact the moves are actually pretty complicated. Some people might disagree with me, but I'm not a trained dancer and I find myself flailing through about 50% of the moves, even after taking the mini private dancing segment, where Julianne focuses in on a few of the more challenging moves. When you 'get' the moves, it's fun, but if you don't, you're just kind of shuffling about aimlessly. I strongly recommend the private dancing lesson before you attempt the actual workout. In both the private lesson and the actual routine, you'll do all of the moves at half-speed before picking them up into a rapid fire pace...I can do the half-speed, but not the full-blown pace on certain moves. Along with the assumption that you've taken the mini-lesson and are keeping up with the dancing, there's also not a lot of focus on form - I found myself pretty sore in some spots after doing this workout, particularly in my back, because there wasn't too much instruction as to the potential physical dangers of certain moves, instead the focus is on the actual dance elements of the move.The second issue with the DVD is that it's literally just one routine, and the mini-lesson. It's about 55 minutes long including a warm-up and cool-down, and to be fair it incorporates three quite different dances, but realistically you're not going to want to do this DVD on a daily basis to get in shape. It's a big daily time commitment, and you'll get bored or frustrated fast. It might provide some nice variation as part of a larger workout program, but I think there are less challenging and equally effective cardio dance DVDs on the market. As for Julianne? She's not a bad instructor...a little on the cheesy side, with a skew towards encouragement for a younger audience on how you can 'use this move in the club', but chances are you've bought this DVD because you were a fan of her sunshiney personality on Dancing with the Stars. Overall I probably wouldn't recommend this DVD to the majority of people out there. It's fun when you've got the hang of it, but it's a steep challenge - more technically than physically - to get there.
