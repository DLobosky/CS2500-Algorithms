The audio and video restoration that went into this DVD release is absolutely incredible and Martial Arts fans won't be disappointed. "King Boxer" is presented in it's 2.35:1 Widescreen format and enhanced for 16x9 television's. The films colors are incredibly sharp and vibrant and the mono sound is clear and crisp. The video transfer of "King Boxer" is the absolute best version I have ever seen and fans of the Kung Fu genre will be amazed by the quality of this release. Sound options include original Mandarin and English dubbed version and choice of subtitles. The special features are an added bonus, specially the Trailer Gallery. This movie has it all, non-stop action, fierce fighting and plenty of blood. Watch the magnificent Lo Lieh as he masters the Iron Fist technique and exacts his revenge.
