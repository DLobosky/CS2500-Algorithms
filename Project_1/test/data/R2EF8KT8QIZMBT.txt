Jesse Eisenberg plays a savvy pizza delivery boy whose driving ability makes the "Fast and Furious" crowd look like pregnant snails dragging a brick. His roommate is Aziz Ansari, who recently got a job as a full time teacher...with a laser pointer. The subplot involves Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) adult versions of Beavis and Butthead who lack jobs. Eisenberg is involved in an early conversation about "Facebook" something he claims he doesn't do anymore, a reference to a previous film. The plot starts out complex and inane. Dwayne's dad (Fred Ward) has money which Dwayne believes he will inherit. A stripper(Bianca Kajlich) knows a hit man and suggests to him during a lap dance that he bump off his dad. The rub is that the hit man needs $100,000 first. So the duo decide to get the cash from a bank robbery which they will make someone else perform...enter our pizza boy. And of course nothing goes as planned as everything takes multiple comical twists. I like Eisenberg. He is a fine actor, but I don't think this was his role. They could have cast his part and written his role better. I liked the bad guys better. The movie had numerous funny lines...."Just like the Marines. If you screw up, we leave your ... behind!" Solid 4 1/2 STARS.F-bomb, crude humor, adult situations, nudity (Bianca Kajlich).
