This has been one of the finest books that I've encountered on the topic.  While the book provides a nice background on the philosophy of yoga, it provides considerable detail on the actual practice of yoga.  As someone who has to contend with multiple sclerosis, I find that the practice of yoga (and water aerobics) has helped me with my movement immensely.  I'd give this book a solid A - reserved for the very finest of books.  Well written, engaging to the amateur and those of moderate background.
