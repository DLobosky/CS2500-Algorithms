I really love this video.  As much as I love the Beatles' 1964 classic film and title song, &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; I strongly feel this is a video that will delight all, from inveterate Beatles' fans to folks just getting familiar with their music.In watching this video, one gets the feeling of riding on the early Beatle train, enjoying the natural banter among the world's most famous foursome.  One gets treated to some rare film footage and the song, &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; is included as a bonus treat as it was not in the original movie, &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot;  Following the Beatles' movements during the early part of 1964 brings all the madcap, pure fun back to the forefront.  I love the way each individual Beatle emerges; the differences in interests, temperament and approach shine through on each song and scene.  This is such a treat!  This is truly a classic.  In watching this, you will be shaking your bangs, dancing and singing along with the Beatles!  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
