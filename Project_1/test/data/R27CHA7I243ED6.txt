Or maybe it did win an award but I didn't give it one!  I thought this story was only Ok and I probably wouldn't have chosen it if Nancy Farmer wasn't the author.  While the history and time period seem interesting, the story itself the fictional story wasn't interesting to me. I enjoy most of her other books so I will be looking forward to any new books she offers.  This one just wasn't a story I could be engaged in.
