The Pocket Guide is one of my desk reference books...It is written so even idiots like me can understand it, and use it. I think it is in the same league as Glover's Pocket Ref, and the Pocket Pal for graphic artists. If you work with Industrial Ethernet, you better buy this book, and stick it in your pocket, briefcase, tool box, or whatever you carry around on the job with you. If you think you need to know about Industrial Ethernet, buy this book and carry it around in your pocket for when you have a chance to catch five minutes and read a few pages. This is the best book published by ISA this year...
